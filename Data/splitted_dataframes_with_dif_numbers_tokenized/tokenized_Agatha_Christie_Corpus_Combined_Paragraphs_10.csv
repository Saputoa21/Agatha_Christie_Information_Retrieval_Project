1,The Big Four,1,7. THE RADIUM THIEVES,1,"On the night of his release, Halliday slept in the room next to ours at the hotel, and all night long I heard him moaning and protesting in his sleep. Undoubtedly his experience in the villa had broken his nerve, and in the morning we failed completely to extract any information from him. He would only repeat his statement about the unlimited power at the disposal of the Big Four, and his assurance of the vengeance which would follow if he talked. After lunch he departed to rejoin his wife in England, but Poirot and I remained behind in Paris. I was all for energetic proceedings of some kind or other, and Poirot's quiescence annoyed me. ""For Heaven's sake, Poirot,"" I urged, ""let us be up and at them."" ""Admirable, _mon ami_, admirable! Up where, and at whom? Be precise, I beg of you."" ""At the Big Four, of course."" ""_Cela va sans dire._ But how would you set about it?"" ""The police,"" I hazarded doubtfully. Poirot smiled. ""They would accuse us of romancing. We have nothing to go upon--nothing whatever. We must wait."" ""Wait for what?"" ""Wait for them to make a move. See now, in England you all comprehend and adore _la boxe_. If one man does not make a move, the other must, and by permitting the adversary to make the attack one learns something about him. That is our part--to let the other side make the attack."" ""You think they will?"" I said doubtfully. ""I have no doubt whatever of it. To begin with, see, they try to get me out of England. That fails. Then, in the Dartmoor affair, we step in and save their victim from the gallows. And yesterday, once again, we interfere with their plans. Assuredly, they will not leave the matter there."" As I reflected on this, there was a knock on the door. Without waiting for a reply, a man stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. He was a tall, thin man, with a slightly hooked nose and a sallow complexion. He wore an overcoat buttoned up to his chin, and a soft hat well pulled","['On', 'night', 'release', 'Halliday', 'slept', 'room', 'next', 'hotel', 'night', 'long', 'I', 'heard', 'moaning', 'protesting', 'sleep', 'Undoubtedly', 'experience', 'villa', 'broken', 'nerve', 'morning', 'failed', 'completely', 'extract', 'information', 'He', 'would', 'repeat', 'statement', 'unlimited', 'power', 'disposal', 'Big', 'Four', 'assurance', 'vengeance', 'would', 'follow', 'talked', 'After', 'lunch', 'departed', 'rejoin', 'wife', 'England', 'Poirot', 'I', 'remained', 'behind', 'Paris', 'I', 'energetic', 'proceedings', 'kind', 'Poirot', ""'s"", 'quiescence', 'annoyed', 'For', 'Heaven', ""'s"", 'sake', 'Poirot', 'I', 'urged', 'let', 'us', 'Admirable', 'mon', 'ami', 'admirable', 'Up', 'Be', 'precise', 'I', 'beg', 'At', 'Big', 'Four', 'course', 'Cela', 'va', 'sans', 'dire', 'But', 'would', 'set', 'The', 'police', 'I', 'hazarded', 'doubtfully', 'Poirot', 'smiled', 'They', 'would', 'accuse', 'us', 'romancing', 'We', 'nothing', 'go', 'upon', '--', 'nothing', 'whatever', 'We', 'must', 'wait', 'Wait', 'Wait', 'make', 'move', 'See', 'England', 'comprehend', 'adore', 'la', 'boxe', 'If', 'one', 'man', 'make', 'move', 'must', 'permitting', 'adversary', 'make', 'attack', 'one', 'learns', 'something', 'That', 'part', '--', 'let', 'side', 'make', 'attack', 'You', 'think', 'I', 'said', 'doubtfully', 'I', 'doubt', 'whatever', 'To', 'begin', 'see', 'try', 'get', 'England', 'That', 'fails', 'Then', 'Dartmoor', 'affair', 'step', 'save', 'victim', 'gallows', 'And', 'yesterday', 'interfere', 'plans', 'Assuredly', 'leave', 'matter', 'As', 'I', 'reflected', 'knock', 'door', 'Without', 'waiting', 'reply', 'man', 'stepped', 'room', 'closed', 'door', 'behind', 'He', 'tall', 'thin', 'man', 'slightly', 'hooked', 'nose', 'sallow', 'complexion', 'He', 'wore', 'overcoat', 'buttoned', 'chin', 'soft', 'hat', 'well', 'pulled']"

""Excuse me, gentlemen, for my somewhat unceremonious entry,"" he said in a soft voice, ""but my business is of a rather unorthodox nature."" Smiling, he advanced to the table and sat down by it. I was about to spring up, but Poirot restrained me with a gesture. ""As you say, Monsieur, your entry is somewhat unceremonious. Will you kindly state your business?"" ""My dear M. Poirot, it is very simple. You have been annoying my friends."" ""In what way?"" ""Come, come, Monsieur Poirot. You do not seriously ask me that? You know as well as I do."" ""It depends, monsieur, upon who these friends of yours are."" Without a word, the man drew from his pocket a cigarette case, and, opening it, took out four cigarettes and tossed them on the table. Then he picked them up and returned them to his case, which he replaced in his pocket. ""Aha!"" said Poirot, ""so it is like that, is it? And what do your friends suggest?"" ""They suggest, monsieur, that you should employ your talents--your very considerable talents--in the detection of legitimate crime--return to your former avocations, and solve the problems of London society ladies."" ""A peaceful programme,"" said Poirot. ""And supposing I do not agree?"" The man made an eloquent gesture. ""We should regret it, of course, exceedingly,"" he said. ""So would all the friends and admirers of the great M. Hercule Poirot. But regrets, however poignant, do not bring a man to life again."" ""Put very delicately,"" said Poirot, nodding his head. ""And supposing I--accept?"" ""In that case I am empowered to offer you--compensation."" He drew out a pocket-book, and threw ten notes on the table. They were for ten thousand francs each. ""That is merely as a guarantee of our good faith,"" he said. ""Ten times that amount will be paid you."" ""Good God,"" I cried, springing up, ""you dare to think--!"" ""Sit down, Hastings,"" said Poirot autocratically. ""Subdue your so beautiful and honest nature and sit down. To you, monsieur, I will say this.

1,The Big Four,1,7. THE RADIUM THIEVES,3,"prevents you from escaping?"" ""By all means do so if you think it advisable,"" said our visitor calmly. ""Oh! look here, Poirot,"" I cried. ""I can't stand this. Ring up the police and have done with it."" Rising swiftly, I strode to the door and stood with my back against it. ""It seems the obvious course,"" murmured Poirot, as though debating with himself. ""But you distrust the obvious, eh?"" said our visitor, smiling. ""Go on, Poirot,"" I urged. ""It will be your responsibility, _mon ami_."" As he lifted the receiver, the man made a sudden, cat-like jump at me. I was ready for him. In another minute we were locked together, staggering round the room. Suddenly I felt him slip and falter. I pressed my advantage. He went down before me. And then, in the very flush of victory, an extraordinary thing happened. I felt myself flying forwards. Head first, I crashed into the wall in a complicated heap. I was up in a minute, but the door was already closing behind my late adversary. I rushed to it and shook it, it was locked on the outside. I seized the telephone from Poirot. ""Is that the bureau? Stop a man who is coming out. A tall man, with a buttoned-up overcoat and a soft hat. He is wanted by the police."" Very few minutes elapsed before we heard a noise in the corridor outside. The key was turned and the door flung open. The manager himself stood in the doorway. ""The man--you have got him?"" I cried. ""No, monsieur. No one has descended."" ""You must have passed him."" ""We have passed no one, monsieur. It is incredible that he can have escaped."" ""You have passed some one, I think,"" said Poirot, in his gentle voice. ""One of the hotel staff, perhaps?"" ""Only a waiter carrying a tray, monsieur."" ""Ah!"" said Poirot, in a tone that spoke infinities. ""So that was why he wore his overcoat buttoned up to his chin,"" mused Poirot, when we had finally got rid of the excited hotel officials. ""I'm awfully sorry, Poirot,"" I murmured, rather crestfallen. ""I thought I'd downed him all right.""

1,The Big Four,1,7. THE RADIUM THIEVES,4,"that was a Japanese trick, I fancy. Do not distress yourself, _mon ami_. All went according to plan--his plan. That is what I wanted."" ""What's this?"" I cried, pouncing on a brown object that lay on the floor. It was a slim pocket-book of brown leather, and had evidently fallen from our visitor's pocket during his struggle with me. It contained two receipted bills in the name of M. Felix Laon, and a folded-up piece of paper which made my heart beat faster. It was a half sheet of note-paper on which a few words were scrawled in pencil but they were words of supreme importance. ""The next meeting of the council will be on Friday at 34 Rue des Echelles at 11 a.m."" It was signed with a big figure 4. And to-day was Friday, and the clock on the mantelpiece showed the hour to be 10:30. ""My God, what a chance!"" I cried. ""Fate is playing into our hands. We must start at once--though. What stupendous luck."" ""So that was why he came,"" murmured Poirot. ""I see it all now."" ""See what? Come on, Poirot, don't stay daydreaming there."" Poirot looked at me, and slowly shook his head, smiling as he did so. ""'Will you walk into my parlour, said the spider to the fly?' That is your little English nursery rhyme, is it not? No, no--they are subtle--but not so subtle as Hercule Poirot."" ""What on earth are you driving at, Poirot?"" ""My friend, I have been asking myself the reason of this morning's visit. Did our visitor really hope to succeed in bribing me? Or, alternatively, in frightening me into abandoning my task? It seemed hardly credible. Why, then, did he come? And now I see the whole plan--very neat--very pretty--the ostensible reason to bribe or frighten me--the necessary struggle which he took no pains to avoid, and which should make the dropped pocket-book natural and reasonable--and finally--the pitfall! Rue des Echelles, 11 a.m.? I think not, _mon ami_! One does not catch Hercule Poirot as easily as that."" ""Good heavens,"" I gasped. Poirot was frowning to himself.

Is it possible that something is about to happen this morning? Something which they are anxious Hercule Poirot should not know about?"" He shook his head. ""We shall see. Here I sit, _mon ami_. We do not stir out this morning. We await events here."" It was at half-past eleven exactly that the summons came. A _petit bleu_. Poirot tore it open, then handed it to me. It was from Madame Olivier, the world-famous scientist, whom we had visited yesterday in connection with the Halliday case. It asked us to come out to Passy at once. We obeyed the summons without an instant's delay. Madame Olivier received us in the same small salon. I was struck anew with the wonderful power of this woman, with her long nun's face and burning eyes--this brilliant successor of Becquerel and the Curies. She came to the point at once. ""Messieurs, you interviewed me yesterday about the disappearance of M. Halliday. I now learn that you returned to the house a second time, and asked to see my secretary, Inez Veroneau. She left the house with you, and has not returned here since."" ""Is that all, madame?"" ""No, monsieur, it is not. Last night the laboratory was broken into, and several valuable papers and memoranda were stolen. The thieves had a try for something more precious still, but luckily they failed to open the big safe."" ""Madame, these are the facts of the case. Your late secretary, Madame Veroneau, was really the Countess Rossakoff, an expert thief, and it was she who was responsible for the disappearance of M. Halliday. How long had she been with you?"" ""Five months, monsieur. What you say amazes me."" ""It is true, nevertheless. These papers, were they easy to find? Or do you think an inside knowledge was shown?"" ""It is rather curious that the thieves knew exactly where to look. You think Inez--"" ""Yes, I have no doubt that it was upon her information that they acted.

1,The Big Four,1,7. THE RADIUM THIEVES,6,"this precious thing that the thieves failed to find? Jewels?"" Madame Olivier shook her head with a faint smile. ""Something much more precious than that, monsieur."" She looked round her, then bent forward, lowering her voice. ""Radium, monsieur."" ""Radium?"" ""Yes, monsieur. I am now at the crux of my experiments. I possess a small portion of radium myself--more has been lent to me for the process I am at work upon. Small though the actual quantity is, it comprises a large amount of the world's stock and represents a value of millions of francs."" ""And where is it?"" ""In its leaden case in the big safe--the safe purposely appears to be of an old and worn-out pattern, but it is really a triumph of the safe-maker's art. That is probably why the thieves were unable to open it."" ""How long are you keeping this radium in your possession?"" ""Only for two days more, monsieur. Then my experiments will be concluded."" Poirot's eyes brightened. ""And Inez Veroneau is aware of the fact? Good--then our friends will come back. Not a word of me to any one, madame. But rest assured, I will save your radium for you. You have a key of the door leading from the laboratory to the garden?"" ""Yes, monsieur. Here it is. I have a duplicate for myself. And here is the key of the garden door leading out into the alleyway between this villa and the next one."" ""I thank you, madame. To-night, go to bed as usual, have no fears, and leave all to me. But not a word to any one--not to your two assistants--Mademoiselle Claude and Monsieur Henri, is it not?--particularly not a word to them."" Poirot left the villa rubbing his hands in great satisfaction. ""What are we going to do now?"" I asked. ""Now, Hastings, we are about to leave Paris--for England."" ""What?"" ""We will pack our effects, have lunch, and drive to the Gare du Nord."" ""But the radium?"" ""I said we were going to leave for England--I did not say we were going to arrive there.

Our enemies must believe that we are going back to England, and they certainly will not believe that unless they see us get on board the train and start."" ""Do you mean we are to slip off again at the last minute?"" ""No, Hastings. Our enemies will be satisfied with nothing less than a _bona fide_ departure."" ""But the train doesn't stop until Calais?"" ""It will stop if it is paid to do so."" ""Oh, come now, Poirot--surely you can't pay an express to stop--they'd refuse."" ""My dear friend, have you never remarked the little handle--the _signal d'arrêt_--penalty for improper use, 100 francs, I think?"" ""Oh! you are going to pull that?"" ""Or rather a friend of mine, Pierre Combeau, will do so. Then, while he is arguing with the guard, and making a big scene, and all the train is agog with interest, you and I will fade quietly away."" We duly carried out Poirot's plan. Pierre Combeau, an old crony of Poirot's, and who evidently knew my little friend's methods pretty well, fell in with the arrangements. The communication cord was pulled just as we got to the outskirts of Paris. Combeau ""made a scene"" in the most approved French fashion and Poirot and I were able to leave the train without any one being interested in our departure. Our first proceeding was to make a considerable change in our appearance. Poirot had brought the materials for this with him in a small case. Two loafers in dirty blue blouses were the result. We had dinner in an obscure hostelry, and started back to Paris afterwards. It was close on eleven o'clock when we found ourselves once more in the neighbourhood of Madame Olivier's villa. We looked up and down the road before slipping into the alleyway. The whole place appeared to be perfectly deserted. One thing we could be quite certain of, no one was following us.

And then, with complete unexpectedness, the blow fell. In a minute we were surrounded, gagged and bound. At least ten men must have been waiting for us. Resistance was useless. Like two helpless bundles we were lifted up and carried along. To my intense astonishment, they took us _towards_ the house and not away from it. With a key they opened the door into the laboratory and carried us into it. One of the men stooped down before the big safe. The door of it swung open. I felt an unpleasant sensation down my spine. Were they going to bundle us into it, and leave us there to asphyxiate slowly? However, to my amazement, I saw that from the inside of the safe steps led down beneath the floor. We were thrust down this narrow way and eventually came out into a big subterranean chamber. A woman stood there, tall and imposing, with a black velvet mask covering her face. She was clearly in command of the situation by her gestures of authority. The men slung us down on the floor and left us--alone with the mysterious creature in the mask. I had no doubt who she was. This was the unknown Frenchwoman--Number Three of the Big Four. She knelt down beside us and removed the gags, but left us bound, then rising and facing us, with a sudden swift gesture she removed her mask. It was Madame Olivier! ""M. Poirot,"" she said, in a low mocking tone. ""The great, the wonderful, the unique M. Poirot. I sent a warning to you yesterday morning. You chose to disregard it--you thought you could pit your wits against US. And now, you are here!"" There was a cold malignity about her that froze me to the marrow. It was so at variance with the burning fire of her eyes. She was mad--mad--with the madness of genius! Poirot said nothing. His jaw had dropped, and he was staring at her. ""Well,"" she said softly, ""this is the end.

1,The Big Four,1,7. THE RADIUM THIEVES,9,"permit our plans to be interfered with. Have you any last request to make?"" Never before, or since, have I felt so near death. Poirot was magnificent. He neither flinched nor paled, just stared at her with unabated interest. ""Your psychology interests me enormously, madame,"" he said quietly. ""It is a pity that I have so short a time to devote to studying it. Yes, I have a request to make. A condemned man is always allowed a last smoke, I believe. I have my cigarette case on me. If you would permit--"" He looked down at his bonds. ""Ah, yes!"" she laughed. ""You would like me to untie your hands, would you not? You are clever, M. Hercule Poirot, I know that. I shall not untie your hands--but I will find you a cigarette."" She knelt down by him, extracted his cigarette case, took out a cigarette, and placed it between his lips. ""And now a match,"" she said, rising. ""It is not necessary, madame."" Something in his voice startled me. She, too, was arrested. ""Do not move, I pray of you, madame. You will regret it if you do. Are you acquainted at all with the properties of cuare? The South American Indians use it as an arrow poison. A scratch with it means death. Some tribes use a little blow-pipe--I, too, have a little blow-pipe constructed so as to look exactly like a cigarette. I have only to blow.... Ah! you start. Do not move, madame. The mechanism of this cigarette is most ingenious. One blows--and a tiny dart resembling a fishbone flies through the air--to find its mark. You do not wish to die, madame. Therefore, I beg of you, release my friend Hastings from his bonds. I cannot use my hands, but I can turn my head--so--you are still covered, madame. Make no mistake, I beg of you."" Slowly, with shaking hands, and rage and hate convulsing her face, she bent down and did his bidding. I was free. Poirot's voice gave me instructions. ""Your bonds will now do for the lady, Hastings.

In another minute, Poirot stood by my side. He bowed to the lady. ""Hercule Poirot is not killed so easily, madame. I wish you good-night."" The gag prevented her from replying, but the murderous gleam in her eyes frightened me. I hoped devoutly that we should never fall into her power again. Three minutes later we were outside the villa, and hurriedly traversing the garden. The road outside was deserted, and we were soon clear of the neighbourhood. Then Poirot broke out. ""I deserve all that that woman said to me. I am a triple imbecile, a miserable animal, thirty-six times an idiot. I was proud of myself for not falling into their trap. And it was not even meant as a trap--except exactly in the way in which I fell into it. They knew I would see through it--they counted on my seeing through it. This explains all--the ease with which they surrendered Halliday--everything. Madame Olivier was the ruling spirit---Vera Rossakoff only her lieutenant. Madame needed Halliday's ideas--she herself had the necessary genius to supply the gaps that perplexed him. Yes, Hastings, we know now who Number Three is--the woman who is probably the greatest scientist in the world! Think of it. The brain of the East, the science of the West--and two others whose identities we do not yet know. But we must find out. To-morrow we will return to London and set about it."" ""You are not going to denounce Madame Olivier to the police?"" ""I should not be believed. That woman is one of the idols of France. And we can prove nothing. We are lucky if she does not denounce _us_."" ""What?"" ""Think of it. We are found at night upon the premises with keys in our possession which she will swear she never gave us. She surprises us at the safe, and we gag and bind her and make away. Have no illusions, Hastings.

1,The Big Four,2,8. IN THE HOUSE OF THE ENEMY,1,"After our adventure in the villa at Passy we returned post haste to London. Several letters were awaiting Poirot. He read one of them with a curious smile, and then handed it to me. ""Read this, _mon ami_."" I turned first to the signature, ""Abe Ryland,"" and recalled Poirot's words: ""the richest man in the world."" Mr. Ryland's letter was curt and incisive. He expressed himself as profoundly dissatisfied with the reasons Poirot had given for withdrawing from the South American proposition at the last moment. ""This gives one furiously to think, does it not?"" said Poirot. ""I suppose it's only natural he should be a bit ratty."" ""No, no, you comprehend not. Remember the words of Mayerling, the man who took refuge here--only to die by the hands of his enemies. 'Number Two is represented by an S with two lines through it--the sign for a dollar, also by two stripes and a star. It may be conjectured therefore that he is an American subject, and that he represents the power of wealth.' Add to those words the fact that Ryland offered me a huge sum to tempt me out of England--and--and what about it, Hastings?"" ""You mean,"" I said, staring, ""that you suspect Abe Ryland, the multi-millionaire, of being Number Two of the Big Four."" ""Your bright intellect has grasped the idea, Hastings. Yes, I do. The tone in which you said multi-millionaire was eloquent--but let me impress upon you one fact--this thing is being run by men at the top--and Mr. Ryland has the reputation of being no beauty in his business dealings. An able, unscrupulous man, a man who has all the wealth that he needs, and is out for unlimited power."" There was undoubtedly something to be said for Poirot's view. I asked him when he had made up his mind definitely upon the point. ""That is just it. I am not sure. I cannot be sure. _Mon ami_, I would give anything to _know_. Let me but place Number Two definitely as Abe Ryland, and we draw nearer to our goal."" ""He has just arrived in London, I see by this,"" I said, tapping the letter. ""Shall you call upon him, and make your apologies in person?"" ""I might do so."" Two days later, Poirot returned to our rooms in a state of boundless excitement.

But there is danger, grave danger. I should not even ask you to attempt it."" If Poirot was trying to frighten me, he was going the wrong way to work, and so I told him. Becoming less incoherent, he unfolded his plan. It seemed that Ryland was looking for an English secretary, one with a good social manner and presence. It was Poirot's suggestion that I should apply for the post. ""I would do it, myself, _mon ami_,"" he explained apologetically. ""But, see you, it is almost impossible for me to disguise myself in the needful manner. I speak the English very well--except when I am excited--but hardly so as to deceive the ear; and even though I were to sacrifice my moustaches, I doubt not but that I should still be recognisable as Hercule Poirot."" I doubted it also, and declared myself ready and willing to take up the part and penetrate into Ryland's household. ""Ten to one he won't engage me anyway,"" I remarked. ""Oh, yes, he will. I will arrange for you such testimonials as shall make him lick his lips. The Home Secretary himself shall recommend you."" This seemed to be carrying things a bit far, but Poirot waved aside my remonstrances. ""Oh, yes, he will do it. I investigated for him a little matter which might have caused a grave scandal. All was solved with discretion and delicacy, and now, as you would say, he perches upon my hand like the little bird and pecks the crumbs."" Our first step was to engage the services of an artist in ""make up."" He was a little man, with a quaint bird-like turn of the head, not unlike Poirot's own. He considered me some time in silence, and then fell to work. When I looked at myself in the glass half an hour afterwards, I was amazed. Special shoes caused me to stand at least two inches taller, and the coat I wore was arranged so as to give me a long, lank, weedy look. My eyebrows had been cunningly altered, giving a totally different expression to my face, I wore pads in my cheeks, and the deep tan of my face was a thing of the past.

God guard you, my friend--for I fear that you go into perilous places."" It was with a beating heart that I presented myself at the Savoy, at an hour named by Mr. Ryland, and asked to see the great man. After being kept waiting a minute or two, I was shown upstairs to his suite. Ryland was sitting at a table. Spread out in front of him was a letter which I could see out of the tail of my eye was in the Home Secretary's handwriting. It was my first sight of the American millionaire, and, in spite of myself, I was impressed. He was tall and lean, with a jutting out chin and slightly hooked nose. His eyes glittered cold and gray behind penthouse brows. He had thick grizzled hair, and a long black cigar (without which, I learned later, he was never seen) protruded rakishly from the corner of his mouth. ""Siddown,"" he grunted. I sat. He tapped the letter in front of him. ""According to this piece here, you're the goods all right, and I don't need to look further. Say, are you well up in the social matters?"" I said that I thought I could satisfy him in that respect. ""I mean to say, if I have a lot of dooks and earls and viscounts and suchlike down to the country place I've gotten, you'll be able to sort them out all right and put them where they should be round the dining table?"" ""Oh! quite easily,"" I replied, smiling. We exchanged a few more preliminaries, and then I found myself engaged. What Mr. Ryland wanted was a secretary conversant with English society, as he already had an American secretary and a stenographer with him. Two days later I went down to Hatton Chase, the seat of the Duke of Loamshire, which the American millionaire had rented for a period of six months. My duties gave me no difficulty whatever.

1,The Big Four,2,8. IN THE HOUSE OF THE ENEMY,4,"very little of Mr. Appleby, the American secretary, but he seemed a pleasant, normal young American, very efficient in his work. Of Miss Martin, the stenographer, I saw rather more. She was a pretty girl of about twenty-three or four, with auburn hair and brown eyes that could look mischievous enough upon occasion, though they were usually cast demurely down. I had an idea that she both disliked and distrusted her employer, though, of course, she was careful never to hint at anything of the kind, but the time came when I was unexpectedly taken into her confidence. I had, of course, carefully scrutinised all the members of the household. One or two of the servants had been newly engaged, one of the footmen, I think, and some of the housemaids. The butler, the housekeeper, and the chef were the duke's own staff, who had consented to remain on in the establishment. The housemaids I dismissed as unimportant; I scrutinised James, the second footman, very carefully; but it was clear that he was an under-footman and an under-footman only. He had, indeed, been engaged by the butler. A person of whom I was far more suspicious was Deaves, Ryland's valet, whom he had brought over from New York with him. An Englishman by birth, with an irreproachable manner, I yet harboured vague suspicions about him. I had been at Hatton Chase three weeks, and not an incident of any kind had arisen which I could lay my finger on in support of our theory. There was no trace of the activities of the Big Four. Mr. Ryland was a man of overpowering force and personality, but I was coming to believe that Poirot had made a mistake when he associated him with that dread organisation. I even heard him mention Poirot in a casual way at dinner one night. ""Wonderful little man, they say. But he's a quitter. How do I know? I put him on a deal, and he turned me down the last minute. I'm not taking any more of your Monsieur Hercule Poirot."" It was at moments such as these that I felt my cheek pads most wearisome! And then Miss Martin told me a rather curious story. Ryland had gone to London for the day, taking Appleby with him.

1,The Big Four,2,8. IN THE HOUSE OF THE ENEMY,5,"I liked the girl very much, she was so unaffected and so natural. I could see that there was something on her mind, and at last out it came. ""Do you know, Major Neville,"" she said, ""I am really thinking of resigning my post here."" I looked somewhat astonished, and she went on hurriedly. ""Oh! I know it's a wonderful job to have got, in a way. I suppose most people would think me a fool to throw it up. But I can't stand abuse, Major Neville. To be sworn at like a trooper is more than I can bear. No gentleman would do such a thing."" ""Has Ryland been swearing at you?"" She nodded. ""Of course, he's always rather irritable and short tempered. That one expects. It's all in the day's work. But to fly into such an absolute fury--over nothing at all. He really looked as though he could have murdered me! And, as I say, over nothing at all!"" ""Tell me about it?"" I said, keenly interested. ""As you know, I open all Mr. Ryland's letters. Some I hand on to Mr. Appleby, others I deal with myself, but I do all the preliminary sorting. Now there are certain letters that come, written on blue paper, and with a tiny 4 marked on the corner--I beg your pardon, did you speak?"" I had been unable to repress a stifled exclamation, but I hurriedly shook my head, and begged her to continue. ""Well, as I was saying, these letters come, and there are strict orders that they are never to be opened, but to be handed over to Mr. Ryland intact. And, of course, I always do so. But there was an unusually heavy mail yesterday morning, and I was opening the letters in a terrific hurry. By mistake I opened one of these letters. As soon as I saw what I had done, I took it to Mr. Ryland and explained. To my utter amazement he flew into the most awful rage. As I tell you, I was quite frightened."" ""What was there in the letter, I wonder, to upset him so?"" ""Absolutely nothing--that's just the curious part of it. I had read it before I discovered my mistake. It was quite short.

She paused a minute and then repeated slowly, whilst I noted down the words unobtrusively, the following:-- ""DEAR SIR,--The essential thing now, I should say, is to see the property. If you insist on the quarry being included, then seventeen thousand seems reasonable. 11% commission too much, 4% is ample. ""Yours truly, ""ARTHUR LEVERSHAM."" Miss Martin went on:-- ""Evidently about some property Mr. Ryland was thinking of buying. But really, I do feel that a man who can get into a rage over such a trifle is, well, dangerous. What do you think I ought to do, Major Neville? You've more experience of the world than I have."" I soothed the girl down, pointed out to her that Mr. Ryland had probably been suffering from the enemy of his race--dyspepsia. In the end I sent her away quite comforted. But I was not so easily satisfied myself. When the girl had gone, and I was alone, I took out my notebook, and ran over the letter which I had jotted down. What did it mean--this apparently innocent-sounding missive? Did it concern some business deal which Ryland was undertaking, and was he anxious that no details about it should leak out until it was carried through? That was a possible explanation. But I remembered the small figure 4 with which the envelopes were marked, and I felt that, at last, I was on the track of the thing we were seeking. I puzzled over the letter all that evening, and most of the next day--and then suddenly the solution came to me. It was so simple, too. The figure 4 was the clue. Read every fourth word in the letter, and an entirely different message appeared. ""Essential should see you quarry seventeen eleven four."" The solution of the figures was easy. Seventeen stood for the seventeenth of October--which was to-morrow, eleven was the time, and four was the signature--either referring to the mysterious Number Four himself--or else it was the ""trade-mark"" so to speak, of the Big Four. The quarry was also intelligible. There was a big disused quarry on the estate about half a mile from the house--a lonely spot, ideal for a secret meeting.

This was a big business--I had no right to play a lone hand, and perhaps jeopardise our chances of success. For the first time, we had stolen a march upon our enemies. We must make good this time--and, disguise the fact as I might, Poirot had the better brain of the two. I wrote off post haste to him, laying the facts before him, and explaining how urgent it was that we should overhear what went on at the interview. If he liked to leave it to me, well and good, but I gave him detailed instructions how to reach the quarry from the station in case he should deem it wise to be present himself. I took the letter down to the village and posted it myself. I had been able to communicate with Poirot throughout my stay, by the simple expedient of posting my letters myself, but we had agreed that he should not attempt to communicate with me in case my letters should be tampered with. I was in a glow of excitement the following evening. No guests were staying in the house, and I was busy with Mr. Ryland in his study all the evening. I had foreseen that this would be the case, which was why I had had no hope of being able to meet Poirot at the station. I was, however, confident that I would be dismissed well before eleven o'clock. Sure enough, just after ten-thirty, Mr. Ryland glanced at the clock, and announced that he was ""through."" I took the hint and retired discreetly. I went upstairs as though going to bed, but slipped quietly down a side staircase and let myself out into the garden, having taken the precaution to don a dark overcoat to hide my white shirt-front. I had gone some way down the garden when I chanced to look over my shoulder. Mr. Ryland was just stepping out from his study window into the garden. He was starting to keep the appointment. I redoubled my pace, so as to get a clear start. I arrived at the quarry somewhat out of breath. There seemed no one about, and I crawled into a thick tangle of bushes and awaited developments.","['feather', 'cap', 'pleasure', 'crowing', 'Poirot', 'But', 'end', 'I', 'overcame', 'temptation', 'This', 'big', 'business', '--', 'I', 'right', 'play', 'lone', 'hand', 'perhaps', 'jeopardise', 'chances', 'success', 'For', 'first', 'time', 'stolen', 'march', 'upon', 'enemies', 'We', 'must', 'make', 'good', 'time', '--', 'disguise', 'fact', 'I', 'might', 'Poirot', 'better', 'brain', 'two', 'I', 'wrote', 'post', 'haste', 'laying', 'facts', 'explaining', 'urgent', 'overhear', 'went', 'interview', 'If', 'liked', 'leave', 'well', 'good', 'I', 'gave', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'reach', 'quarry', 'station', 'case', 'deem', 'wise', 'present', 'I', 'took', 'letter', 'village', 'posted', 'I', 'able', 'communicate', 'Poirot', 'throughout', 'stay', 'simple', 'expedient', 'posting', 'letters', 'agreed', 'attempt', 'communicate', 'case', 'letters', 'tampered', 'I', 'glow', 'excitement', 'following', 'evening', 'No', 'guests', 'staying', 'house', 'I', 'busy', 'Mr.', 'Ryland', 'study', 'evening', 'I', 'foreseen', 'would', 'case', 'I', 'hope', 'able', 'meet', 'Poirot', 'station', 'I', 'however', 'confident', 'I', 'would', 'dismissed', 'well', 'eleven', ""o'clock"", 'Sure', 'enough', 'ten', 'thirty', 'Mr.', 'Ryland', 'glanced', 'clock', 'announced', 'I', 'took', 'hint', 'retired', 'discreetly', 'I', 'went', 'upstairs', 'though', 'going', 'bed', 'slipped', 'quietly', 'side', 'staircase', 'let', 'garden', 'taken', 'precaution', 'dark', 'overcoat', 'hide', 'white', 'shirt', 'front', 'I', 'gone', 'way', 'garden', 'I', 'chanced', 'look', 'shoulder', 'Mr.', 'Ryland', 'stepping', 'study', 'window', 'garden', 'He', 'starting', 'keep', 'appointment', 'I', 'redoubled', 'pace', 'get', 'clear', 'start', 'I', 'arrived', 'quarry', 'somewhat', 'breath', 'There', 'seemed', 'one', 'I', 'crawled', 'thick', 'tangle', 'bushes', 'awaited', 'developments']"
1,The Big Four,2,8. IN THE HOUSE OF THE ENEMY,8,"Ten minutes later, just on the stroke of eleven, Ryland stalked up, his hat over his eyes and the inevitable cigar in his mouth. He gave a quick look round, and then plunged into the hollows of the quarry below. Presently I heard a low murmur of voices come up to me. Evidently the other man--or men--whoever they were, had arrived first at the rendezvous. I crawled cautiously out of the bushes, and inch by inch, using the utmost precaution against noise, I wormed myself down the steep path. Only a boulder now separated me from the talking men. Secure in the blackness, I peeped round the edge of it and found myself facing the muzzle of a black, murderous-looking automatic! ""Hands up!"" said Mr. Ryland succinctly. ""I've been waiting for you."" He was seated in the shadow of the rock, so that I could not see his face, but the menace in his voice was unpleasant. Then I felt a ring of cold steel on the back of my neck, and Ryland lowered his own automatic. ""That's right, George,"" he drawled. ""March him around here."" Raging inwardly, I was conducted to a spot in the shadows, where the unseen George (whom I suspected of being the impeccable Deaves), gagged and bound me securely. Ryland spoke again in a tone which I had difficulty in recognising, so cold and menacing was it. ""This is going to be the end of you two. You've got in the way of the Big Four once too often. Ever heard of land slides? There was one about here two years ago. There's going to be another to-night. I've fixed that good and square. Say, that friend of yours doesn't keep his dates very punctually."" A wave of horror swept over me. Poirot! In another minute he would walk straight into the trap. And I was powerless to warn him. I could only pray that he had elected to leave the matter in my hands, and had remained in London. Surely, if he had been coming, he would have been here by now. With every minute that passed, my hopes rose. Suddenly they were dashed to pieces. I heard footsteps--cautious footsteps, but footsteps nevertheless. I writhed in impotent agony. They came down the path, paused, and then Poirot himself appeared, his head a little on one side, peering into","['Ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'stroke', 'eleven', 'Ryland', 'stalked', 'hat', 'eyes', 'inevitable', 'cigar', 'mouth', 'He', 'gave', 'quick', 'look', 'round', 'plunged', 'hollows', 'quarry', 'Presently', 'I', 'heard', 'low', 'murmur', 'voices', 'come', 'Evidently', 'man', '--', 'men', '--', 'whoever', 'arrived', 'first', 'rendezvous', 'I', 'crawled', 'cautiously', 'bushes', 'inch', 'inch', 'using', 'utmost', 'precaution', 'noise', 'I', 'wormed', 'steep', 'path', 'Only', 'boulder', 'separated', 'talking', 'men', 'Secure', 'blackness', 'I', 'peeped', 'round', 'edge', 'found', 'facing', 'muzzle', 'black', 'murderous', 'looking', 'automatic', 'Hands', 'said', 'Mr.', 'Ryland', 'succinctly', 'I', ""'ve"", 'waiting', 'He', 'seated', 'shadow', 'rock', 'I', 'could', 'see', 'face', 'menace', 'voice', 'unpleasant', 'Then', 'I', 'felt', 'ring', 'cold', 'steel', 'back', 'neck', 'Ryland', 'lowered', 'automatic', 'That', ""'s"", 'right', 'George', 'drawled', 'March', 'around', 'Raging', 'inwardly', 'I', 'conducted', 'spot', 'shadows', 'unseen', 'George', 'I', 'suspected', 'impeccable', 'Deaves', 'gagged', 'bound', 'securely', 'Ryland', 'spoke', 'tone', 'I', 'difficulty', 'recognising', 'cold', 'menacing', 'This', 'going', 'end', 'two', 'You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'way', 'Big', 'Four', 'often', 'Ever', 'heard', 'land', 'slides', 'There', 'one', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'There', ""'s"", 'going', 'another', 'night', 'I', ""'ve"", 'fixed', 'good', 'square', 'Say', 'friend', ""n't"", 'keep', 'dates', 'punctually', 'A', 'wave', 'horror', 'swept', 'Poirot', 'In', 'another', 'minute', 'would', 'walk', 'straight', 'trap', 'And', 'I', 'powerless', 'warn', 'I', 'could', 'pray', 'elected', 'leave', 'matter', 'hands', 'remained', 'London', 'Surely', 'coming', 'would', 'With', 'every', 'minute', 'passed', 'hopes', 'rose', 'Suddenly', 'dashed', 'pieces', 'I', 'heard', 'footsteps', '--', 'cautious', 'footsteps', 'footsteps', 'nevertheless', 'I', 'writhed', 'impotent', 'agony', 'They', 'came', 'path', 'paused', 'Poirot', 'appeared', 'head', 'little', 'one', 'side', 'peering']"

Deaves sprang forward as he did so, and took Poirot in the rear. The ambush was complete. ""Please to meet you, Mr. Hercule Poirot,"" said the American grimly. Poirot's self-possession was marvellous. He did not turn a hair. But I saw his eyes searching in the shadows. ""My friend? He is here?"" ""Yes, you are both in the trap--the trap of the Big Four."" He laughed. ""A trap?"" queried Poirot. ""Say, haven't you tumbled to it yet?"" ""I comprehend that there is a trap--yes,"" said Poirot gently. ""But you are in error, monsieur. It is _you_ who are in it--not I and my friend."" ""What?"" Ryland raised the big automatic, but I saw his gaze falter. ""If you fire, you commit murder watched by ten pairs of eyes, and you will be hanged for it. This place is surrounded--has been for the last hour--by Scotland Yard men. It is checkmate, Mr. Abe Ryland."" He uttered a curious whistle, and as though by magic, the place was alive with men. They seized Ryland and the valet and disarmed them. After speaking a few words to the officer in charge, Poirot took me by the arm, and led me away. Once clear of the quarry he embraced me with vigour. ""You are alive--you are unhurt. It is magnificent. Often have I blamed myself for letting you go."" ""I'm perfectly all right,"" I said, disengaging myself. ""But I'm just a bit fogged. You tumbled to their little scheme, did you?"" ""But I was waiting for it! For what else did I permit you to go there? Your false name, your disguise, not for a moment was it intended to deceive!"" ""What?"" I cried. ""You never told me."" ""As I have frequently told you, Hastings, you have a nature so beautiful and so honest that unless you are yourself deceived, it is impossible for you to deceive others.

""But what they do not know is that I am waiting for just this very thing to happen. I go post haste to Japp and arrange things. And so, as you see, all is triumph!"" I was not particularly pleased with Poirot, and I told him so. We went back to London on a milk train in the early hours of the morning, and a most uncomfortable journey it was. I was just out of my bath and indulging in pleasurable thoughts of breakfast when I heard Japp's voice in the sitting-room. I threw on a bathrobe and hurried in. ""A pretty mare's nest you've got us into this time,"" Japp was saying. ""It's too bad of you, M. Poirot. First time I've ever known you take a toss."" Poirot's face was a study. Japp went on. ""There were we, taking all this Black Hand stuff seriously--and all the time it was the footman."" ""The footman?"" I gasped. ""Yes, James, or whatever his name is. Seems he laid 'em a wager in the servants' hall that he could get taken for the old man by his nibs--that's you, Captain Hastings--and would hand him out a lot of spy stuff about a Big Four gang."" ""Impossible!"" I cried. ""Don't you believe it. I marched our gentleman straight to Hatton Chase, and there was the real Ryland in bed and asleep, and the butler and the cook and God knows how many of them to swear to the wager. Just a silly hoax--that's all it was--and the valet is with him."" ""So that was why he kept in the shadow,"" murmured Poirot. After Japp had gone we looked at each other. ""We _know_, Hastings,"" said Poirot at last. ""Number Two of the Big Four is Abe Ryland. The masquerading on the part of the footman was to ensure a way of retreat in case of emergencies.

Since we had come into contact with the Big Four, they had committed two murders, abducted Halliday, and had been within an ace of killing Poirot and myself; whereas so far we had hardly scored a point in the game. Poirot treated my complaints lightly. ""So far, Hastings,"" he said, ""they laugh. That is true, but you have a proverb, have you not: 'He laughs best who laughs at the end'?

I forbore to pander to his conceit by asking the obvious question.

He had abandoned his private practice almost entirely, and I know that at this time he refused some remarkably handsome fees. True, he would sometimes investigate cases which intrigued him, but he usually dropped them the moment he was convinced that they had no connection with the activities of the Big Four. This attitude of his was remarkably profitable to our friend, Inspector Japp. Undeniably he gained much kudos for solving several problems in which his success was really due to a half-contemptuous hint from Poirot. In return for such service Japp supplied full details of any case which he thought might interest the little Belgian, and when he was put in charge of what the newspaper called ""The Yellow Jasmine Mystery,"" he wired Poirot, asking him whether he would care to come down and look into the case.

To begin with, he was not feeling ill at all, he explained, but the taste of some curry that he had been eating at dinner had struck him as peculiar.

""In spite of his statement that he was not feeling ill, the doctor noted that the shock of his suspicions had evidently affected him, and that his heart was feeling it. Accordingly he administered an injection--not of a narcotic, but of strychnine.

Thought you'd like to be let in on this. Tip-top mystery, isn't it?"" I read this aright as showing Japp to be completely puzzled and hoping to pick up a pointer from Poirot. Japp had a car waiting, and we drove up in it to Croftlands. It was a square, white house, quite unpretentious, and covered with creepers, including the starry yellow jasmine. Japp looked up at it as we did. ""Must have been balmy to go writing that, poor old cove,"" he remarked. ""Hallucinations, perhaps, and thought he was outside."" Poirot was smiling at him. ""Which was it, my good Japp?"" he asked; ""accident or murder?"" The Inspector seemed a little embarrassed by the question. ""Well, if it weren't for that curry business, I'd be for accident every time. There's no sense in holding a live man's head in the fire--why, he'd scream the house down."" ""Ah!"" said Poirot in a low voice. ""Fool that I have been. Triple imbecile! You are a cleverer man than I am, Japp."" Japp was rather taken aback by the compliment--Poirot being usually given to exclusive self praise. He reddened and muttered something about there being a lot of doubt about that. He led the way through the house to the room where the tragedy had occurred--Mr. Paynter's study. It was a wide, low room, with book-lined walls and big leather arm-chairs.

When the doctor left this room, he merely closed the door behind him. The next morning it was found locked. Who locked it? Mr. Paynter? Ah Ling declares that the window was closed and bolted. Dr. Quentin, on the other hand, has an impression that it was closed, but not fastened, but he won't swear either way. If he could, it would make a great difference. If the man _was_ murdered, some one entered the room either through the door or the window--if through the door, it was an inside job; if through the window, it might have been any one.

""My good Japp, is it possible that you throw the mud in my eyes? I know well enough that it is the Chinaman you suspect. But you are so artful. You want me to help you--and yet you drag the red kipper across the trail."" Japp burst out laughing. ""That's you all over, Mr. Poirot. Yes, I'd bet on the Chink, I'll admit it now.

""How was it called, this book?"" he asked. ""_The Hidden Hand in China_, I think it was called."" ""Aha!"" said Poirot, with almost a gasp. Then he said quickly, ""Let me see the Chinaman, Ah Ling."" The Chinaman was sent for and appeared, shuffling along, with his eyes cast down, and his pigtail swinging. His impassive face showed no trace of any kind of emotion. ""Ah Ling,"" said Poirot, ""are you sorry your master is dead?"" ""I welly sorry. He good master."" ""You know who kill him?"" ""I not know. I tell pleeceman if I know."" The questions and answers went on. With the same impassive face, Ah Ling described how he had made the curry. The cook had had nothing to do with it, he declared, no hand had touched it but his own. I wondered if he saw where his admission was leading him. He stuck to it too, that the window to the garden was bolted that evening. If it was open in the morning, his master must have opened it himself. At last Poirot dismissed him. ""That will do, Ah Ling."" Just as the Chinaman had got to the door, Poirot recalled him. ""And you know nothing, you say, of the Yellow Jasmine?"" ""No, what should I know?""

A down stroke, a line at right angles, and then a second line down which completed a big 4. The effect on the Chinaman was electrical. For one moment his face was a mask of terror. Then, as suddenly, it was impassive again, and repeating his grave disclaimer, he withdrew. Japp departed in search of young Paynter, and Poirot and I were left alone together.

In his book there was doubtless some vital information concerning the doings of Number One, Li Chang Yen, the head and brains of the Big Four."" ""But who--how--"" ""Hush, here they come.""

""I dined out with some neighbours of ours, the Wycherlys,"" he explained. ""What time did I get home? Oh, about eleven. I had a latch-key, you know. All the servants had gone to bed, and I naturally thought my uncle had done the same.

His story was substantially the same as he had told at the inquest, and he had little to add to it. He received us in his surgery, having just come to the end of his consulting patients. He seemed an intelligent man. A certain primness of manner went well with his pince-nez, but I fancied that he would be thoroughly modern in his methods.

""'_Gelsemini Radix._ Yellow Jasmine. Composition: Alkaloids _gelseminine_ C_{22}H_{26}N_{2}O_{3}, a potent poison acting like coniine; _gelsemine_ C_{12}H_{14}NO_{2}, acting like strychnine; _gelsemic acid_, etc. Gelsemium is a powerful depressant to the central nervous system. At a late stage in its action it paralyses the motor nerve endings, and in large doses causes giddiness and loss of muscular power. Death is due to paralysis of the respiratory centre.' ""You see, Hastings? At the beginning I had an inkling of the truth when Japp made his remark about a live man being forced into the fire. I realised then that it was a dead man who was burned."" ""But why? What was the point?""

1,The Big Four,5,11. A CHESS PROBLEM,1,"Poirot and I often dined at a small restaurant in Soho. We were there one evening, when we observed a friend at an adjacent table. It was Inspector Japp, and as there was room at our table, he came and joined us. It was some time since either of us had seen him. ""Never do you stop in to see us nowadays,"" declared Poirot reproachfully. ""Not since the affair of the Yellow Jasmine have we met, and that is nearly a month ago."" ""I've been up north--that's why. How are things with you? Big Four still going strong--eh?"" Poirot shook a finger at him reproachfully. ""Ah! you mock yourself at me--but the Big Four--they exist."" ""Oh! I don't doubt that--but they're not the hub of the universe, as you make out."" ""My friend, you are very much mistaken. The greatest power for evil in the world to-day is this 'Big Four.' To what end they are tending, no one knows, but there has never been another such criminal organisation. The finest brain in China at the head of it, an American millionaire, and a French woman scientist as members, and for the fourth--"" Japp interrupted. ""I know--I know. Regular bee in your bonnet over it all. It's becoming your little mania, Moosior Poirot. Let's talk of something else for a change. Take any interest in chess?"" ""I have played it, yes."" ""Did you see that curious business yesterday? Match between two players of world-wide reputation, and one died during the game?"" ""I saw a mention of it. Dr. Savaronoff, the Russian champion, was one of the players, and the other, who succumbed to heart failure, was the brilliant young American, Gilmour Wilson."" ""Quite right. Savaronoff beat Rubenstein and became Russian champion some years ago. Wilson is said to be a second Capablanca."" ""A very curious occurrence,"" mused Poirot. ""If I mistake not, you have a particular interest in the matter?"" Japp gave a rather embarrassed laugh. ""You've hit it, Moosior Poirot. I'm puzzled. Wilson was sound as a bell--no trace of heart trouble. His death is quite inexplicable."" ""You suspect Dr. Savaronoff of putting him out of the way?"" I cried. ""Hardly that,"" said Japp dryly. ""I don't think even a Russian would murder another man in order not to be beaten at chess--and anyway, from all I can make out, the boot was likely to be on the other leg. The doctor is supposed to be very hot stuff--second to Lasker they say he is."" Poirot nodded thoughtfully. ""Then what exactly is your little idea?"" he asked. ""Why should Wilson be poisoned? For, I assume, of course, that it is poison you suspect."" ""Naturally. Heart failure means your heart stops beating--that's all there is to that.

Wilson's death was extraordinarily sudden. He seemed quite as usual and was actually moving one of the pieces when he suddenly fell forward--dead!"" ""There are very few poisons would act in such a fashion,"" objected Poirot. ""I know. The autopsy will help us, I expect. But why should any one want Gilmour Wilson out of the way--that's what I'd like to know? Harmless unassuming young fellow. Just come over here from the States, and apparently hadn't an enemy in the world."" ""It seems incredible,"" I mused. ""Not at all,"" said Poirot, smiling. ""Japp has his theory, I can see."" ""I have, Moosior Poirot. I don't believe the poison was meant for Wilson--it was meant for the other man."" ""Savaronoff?"" ""Yes. Savaronoff fell foul of the Bolsheviks at the outbreak of the Revolution. He was even reported killed. In reality he escaped, and for three years endured incredible hardships in the wilds of Siberia. His sufferings were so great that he is now a changed man. His friends and acquaintances declare they would hardly have recognised him. His hair is white, and his whole aspect that of a man terribly aged. He is a semi-invalid, and seldom goes out, living alone with a niece, Sonia Daviloff, and a Russian man-servant in a flat down Westminster way. It is possible that he still considers himself a marked man. Certainly he was very unwilling to agree to this chess contest. He refused several times point blank, and it was only when the newspapers took it up and began making a fuss about the 'unsportsmanlike refusal' that he gave in. Gilmour Wilson had gone on challenging him with real Yankee pertinacity, and in the end he got his way. Now I ask you, Moosior Poirot, why wasn't he willing? Because he didn't want attention drawn to him. Didn't want somebody or other to get on his track. That's my solution--Gilmour Wilson got pipped by mistake."" ""There is no one who has any private reason to gain by Savaronoff's death?"" ""Well, his niece, I suppose. He's recently come into an immense fortune. Left him by Madame Gospoja whose husband was a sugar profiteer under the old regime. They had an affair together once, I believe, and she refused steadfastly to credit the reports of his death."" ""Where did the match take place?"" ""In Savaronoff's own flat. He's an invalid, as I told you."" ""Many people there to watch it?"" ""At least a dozen--probably more.""

""Has it occurred to you that, in the meantime, supposing your assumption that Savaronoff was the intended victim to be correct, the murderer may try again?"" ""Of course it has. Two men are watching Savaronoff's flat."" ""That will be very useful if any one should call with a bomb under his arm,"" said Poirot dryly. ""You're getting interested, Moosior Poirot,"" said Japp, with a twinkle. ""Care to come round to the mortuary and see Wilson's body before the doctors start on it? Who knows, his tie-pin may be askew, and that may give you a valuable clue that will solve the mystery."" ""My dear Japp, all through dinner my fingers have been itching to rearrange your own tie-pin. You permit, yes? Ah! that is much more pleasing to the eye. Yes, by all means, let us go to the mortuary."" I could see that Poirot's attention was completely captivated by this new problem. It was so long since he had shown any interest over any outside case that I was quite rejoiced to see him back in his old form. For my own part, I felt a deep pity as I looked down upon the motionless form and convulsed face of the hapless young American who had come by his death in such a strange way. Poirot examined the body attentively. There was no mark on it anywhere, except a small scar on the left hand. ""And the doctor says that's a burn, not a cut,"" explained Japp. Poirot's attention shifted to the contents of the dead man's pockets which a constable spread out for our inspection. There was nothing much--a handkerchief, keys, notecase filled with notes, and some unimportant letters. But one object standing by itself filled Poirot with interest. ""A chessman!"" he exclaimed. ""A white bishop. Was that in his pocket?"" ""No, clasped in his hand. We had quite a difficulty to get it out of his fingers. It must be returned to Dr. Savaronoff sometime. It's part of a very beautiful set of carved ivory chessmen."" ""Permit me to return it to him. It will make an excuse for my going there."" ""Aha!"" cried Japp. ""So you want to come in on this case?"" ""I admit it. So skilfully have you aroused my interest."" ""That's fine. Got you away from your brooding. Captain Hastings is pleased, too, I can see."" ""Quite right,"" I said, laughing. Poirot turned back towards the body. ""No other little detail you can tell me about--him?"" he asked. ""I don't think so."" ""Not even--that he was left-handed?"" ""You're a wizard, Moosior Poirot. How did you know that? He _was_ left-handed. Not that it's anything to do with the case.""

1,The Big Four,5,11. A CHESS PROBLEM,4,"ruffled. ""My little joke--that was all. I like to play you the trick, see you."" We went out upon an amicable understanding. The following morning saw us wending our way to Dr. Savaronoff's flat in Westminster. ""Sonia Daviloff,"" I mused. ""It's a pretty name."" Poirot stopped, and threw me a look of despair. ""Always looking for romance! You are incorrigible. It would serve you right if Sonia Daviloff turned out to be our friend and enemy the Countess Vera Rossakoff."" At the mention of the countess, my face clouded over. ""Surely, Poirot, you don't suspect--"" ""But, no, no. It was a joke! I have not the Big Four on the brain to that extent, whatever Japp may say."" The door of the flat was opened to us by a man-servant with a peculiarly wooden face. It seemed impossible to believe that that impassive countenance could ever display emotion. Poirot presented a card on which Japp had scribbled a few words of introduction, and we were shown into a low, long room furnished with rich hangings and curios. One or two wonderful ikons hung upon the walls, and exquisite Persian rugs lay upon the floor. A samovar stood upon a table. I was examining one of the ikons which I judged to be of considerable value, and turned to see Poirot prone upon the floor. Beautiful as the rug was, it hardly seemed to me to necessitate such close attention. ""Is it such a very wonderful specimen?"" I asked. ""Eh? Oh! the rug? But no, it was not the rug I was remarking. But it _is_ a beautiful specimen, far too beautiful to have a large nail wantonly driven through the middle of it. No, Hastings,"" as I came forward, ""the nail is not there now. But the hole remains."" A sudden sound behind us made me spin round, and Poirot spring nimbly to his feet. A girl was standing in the doorway. Her eyes, full upon us, were dark with suspicion. She was of medium height, with a beautiful, rather sullen face, dark blue eyes, and very black hair which was cut short. Her voice, when she spoke, was rich and sonorous, and completely un-English. ""I fear my uncle will be unable to see you. He is a great invalid."" ""That is a pity, but perhaps you will kindly help me instead. You are Mademoiselle Daviloff, are you not?""

""Who is Ivan, and why do you say he was right?"" ""It was Ivan who opened the door to you--and he has already said to me that in his opinion Gilmour Wilson did not die a natural death--that he was poisoned by mistake."" ""By mistake."" ""Yes, the poison was meant for my uncle."" She had quite forgotten her first distrust now, and was speaking eagerly. ""Why do you say that, mademoiselle. Who should wish to poison Dr. Savaronoff?"" She shook her head. ""I do not know. I am all in the dark. And my uncle, he will not trust me. It is natural, perhaps. You see, he hardly knows me. He saw me as a child, and not since till I came to live with him here in London. But this much I do know, he is in fear of something. We have many secret societies in Russia, and one day I overheard something which made me think it was of just such a society he went in fear. Tell me, monsieur""--she came a step nearer, and dropped her voice--""have you ever heard of a society called the 'Big Four'?"" Poirot jumped nearly out of his skin. His eyes positively bulged with astonishment. ""Why do you--what do you know of the Big Four, mademoiselle?"" ""There is such an association, then! I overheard a reference to them, and asked my uncle about it afterwards. Never have I seen a man so afraid. He turned all white and shaking. He was in fear of them, monsieur, in great fear, I am sure of it. And, by mistake, they killed the American, Wilson."" ""The Big Four,"" murmured Poirot. ""Always the Big Four! An astonishing coincidence, mademoiselle, your uncle is still in danger. I must save him. Now recount to me exactly the events of that fatal evening. Show me the chess-board, the table, how the two men sat--everything."" She went to the side of the room and brought out a small table. The top of it was exquisite, inlaid with squares of silver and black to represent a chess-board. ""This was sent to my uncle a few weeks ago as a present, with the request that he would use it in the next match he played. It was in the middle of the room--so."" Poirot examined the table with what seemed to me quite unnecessary attention. He was not conducting the inquiry at all as I would have done. Many of his questions seemed to me pointless, and upon really vital matters he seemed to have no questions to ask.

Sonia Daviloff brought them to him in a box. He examined one or two of them in a perfunctory manner. ""An exquisite set,"" he murmured absent-mindedly. Still not a question as to what refreshments there had been, or what people had been present. I cleared my throat significantly. ""Don't you think, Poirot, that--"" He interrupted me peremptorily. ""Do not think, my friend. Leave all to me. Mademoiselle, is it quite impossible that I should see your uncle?"" A faint smile showed itself on her face. ""He will see you, yes. You understand, it is my part to interview all strangers first."" She disappeared. I heard a murmur of voices in the next room, and a minute later she came back and motioned us to pass into the adjoining room. The man who lay there on a couch was an imposing figure. Tall, gaunt, with huge bushy eyebrows and white beard, and a face haggard as the result of starvation and hardships. Dr. Savaronoff was a distinct personality. I noted the peculiar formation of his head, its unusual height. A great chess player must have a great brain, I knew. I could easily understand Dr. Savaronoff being the second greatest player in the world. Poirot bowed. ""M. le Docteur, may I speak to you alone?"" Savaronoff turned to his niece. ""Leave us, Sonia."" She disappeared obediently. ""Now, sir, what is it?"" ""Dr. Savaronoff, you have recently come into an enormous fortune. If you should--die unexpectedly, who inherits it?"" ""I have made a will leaving everything to my niece, Sonia Daviloff. You do not suggest--"" ""I suggest nothing, but you have not seen your niece since she was a child. It would have been easy for any one to impersonate her."" Savaronoff seemed thunderstruck by the suggestion. Poirot went on easily. ""Enough as to that. I give you the word of warning, that is all. What I want you to do now is to describe to me the game of chess the other evening."" ""How do you mean--describe it?"" ""Well, I do not play the chess myself, but I understand that there are various regular ways of beginning--the gambit, do they not call it?"" Dr. Savaronoff smiled a little. ""Ah! I comprehend you now. Wilson opened Ruy Lopez--one of the soundest openings there is, and one frequently adopted in tournaments and matches."" ""And how long had you been playing when the tragedy happened?"" ""It must have been about the third or fourth move when Wilson suddenly fell forward over the table, stone dead.""

I will disturb you no longer."" Ivan was in the hall to show us out. Poirot lingered on the threshold. ""The flat below this, do you know who lives there?"" ""Sir Charles Kingwell, a member of Parliament, sir. It has been let furnished lately, though."" ""Thank you."" We went out into the bright winter sunlight. ""Well, really, Poirot,"" I burst out. ""I don't think you've distinguished yourself this time. Surely your questions were very inadequate."" ""You think so, Hastings?"" Poirot looked at me appealingly. ""I was _bouleversé_, yes. What would you have asked?"" I considered the question carefully, and then outlined my scheme to Poirot. He listened with what seemed to be close interest. My monologue lasted until we had nearly reached home. ""Very excellent, very searching, Hastings,"" said Poirot, as he inserted his key in the door and preceded me up the stairs. ""But quite unnecessary."" ""Unnecessary!"" I cried, amazed. ""If the man was poisoned--"" ""Aha,"" cried Poirot, pouncing upon a note which lay on the table. ""From Japp. Just as I thought."" He flung it over to me. It was brief and to the point. No traces of poison had been found, and there was nothing to show how the man came by his death. ""You see,"" said Poirot, ""our questions would have been quite unnecessary."" ""You guessed this beforehand?"" ""'Forecast the probable result of the deal,'"" quoted Poirot from a recent Bridge problem on which I had spent much time. ""_Mon ami_, when you do that successfully, you do not call it guessing."" ""Don't let's split hairs,"" I said impatiently. ""You foresaw this?"" ""I did."" ""Why?"" Poirot put his hand into his pocket and pulled out--a white bishop. ""Why,"" I cried, ""you forgot to give it back to Dr. Savaronoff."" ""You are in error, my friend. That bishop still reposes in my left-hand pocket. I took its fellow from the box of chessmen Mademoiselle Daviloff kindly permitted me to examine. The plural of one bishop is two bishops."" He sounded the final ""s"" with a great hiss. I was completely mystified. ""But why did you take it?"" ""_Parbleu_, I wanted to see if they were exactly alike."" He stood them on the table side by side. ""Well, they are, of course,"" I said, ""exactly alike."" Poirot looked at them with his head on one side. ""They seem so, I admit. But one should take no fact for granted until it is proved.

Hercule Poirot speaks. Watch the man-servant, Ivan. On no account let him slip through your fingers. Yes, yes, it is as I say."" He dashed down the receiver and turned to me. ""You see it not, Hastings? I will explain. Wilson was not poisoned, he was electrocuted. A thin metal rod passes up the middle of one of those chessmen. The table was prepared beforehand and set upon a certain spot on the floor. When the bishop was placed upon one of the silver squares, the current passed through Wilson's body, killing him instantly. The only mark was the electric burn upon his hand--his left hand, because he was left-handed. The 'special table' was an extremely cunning piece of mechanism. The table I examined was a duplicate, perfectly innocent. It was substituted for the other immediately after the murder. The thing was worked from the flat below, which, if you remember, was let furnished. But one accomplice at least was in Savaronoff's flat. The girl is an agent of the Big Four, working to inherit Savaronoff's money."" ""And Ivan?"" ""I strongly suspect that Ivan is none other than the famous Number Four."" ""_What?_"" ""Yes. The man is a marvellous character actor. He can assume any part he pleases."" I thought back over past adventures, the lunatic asylum keeper, the butcher's young man, the suave doctor, all the same man, and all totally unlike each other. ""It's amazing,"" I said at last. ""Everything fits in. Savaronoff had an inkling of the plot, and that's why he was so averse to playing the match."" Poirot looked at me without speaking. Then he turned abruptly away, and began pacing up and down. ""Have you a book on chess by any chance, _mon ami_?"" he asked suddenly. ""I believe I have somewhere."" It took me some time to ferret it out, but I found it at last, and brought it to Poirot, who sank down in a chair and started reading it with the greatest attention. In about a quarter of an hour the telephone rang. I answered it. It was Japp. Ivan had left the flat, carrying a large bundle. He had sprung into a waiting taxi, and the chase had begun. He was evidently trying to lose his pursuers. In the end he seemed to fancy that he had done so, and had then driven to a big empty house at Hampstead. The house was surrounded. I recounted all this to Poirot. He merely stared at me as though he scarcely took in what I was saying. He held out the chess book.

He has the choice of various defences. It was White's third move that killed Gilmour Wilson, 3B-Kt5. Only the third move--does that say nothing to you?"" I hadn't the least idea what he meant, and told him so. ""I suppose, Hastings, that while you were sitting in this chair, you heard the front door being opened and shut, what would you think?"" ""I should think some one had gone out, I suppose."" ""Yes--but there are always two ways of looking at things. Some one gone out--some one come _in_--two totally different things, Hastings. But if you assumed the wrong one, presently some little discrepancy would creep in and show you that you were on the wrong track."" ""What does all this mean, Poirot?"" Poirot sprang to his feet with sudden energy. ""It means that I have been a triple imbecile. Quick, quick, to the flat in Westminster. We may yet be in time."" We tore off in a taxi. Poirot returned no answer to my excited questions. We raced up the stairs. Repeated rings and knocks brought no reply, but listening closely I could distinguish a hollow groan coming from within. The hall porter proved to have a master key, and after a few difficulties he consented to use it. Poirot went straight to the inner room. A whiff of chloroform met us. On the floor was Sonia Daviloff, gagged and bound, with a great wad of saturated cotton wool over her nose and mouth. Poirot tore it off and began to take measures to restore her. Presently a doctor arrived, and Poirot handed her over to his charge and drew aside with me. There was no sign of Dr. Savaronoff. ""What does it all mean?"" I asked, bewildered. ""It means that before two equal deductions I chose the wrong one. You heard me say that it would be easy for any one to impersonate Sonia Daviloff because her uncle had not seen her for so many years?"" ""Yes?"" ""Well, precisely the opposite held good also. It was equally easy for any one to impersonate the uncle."" ""What?"" ""Savaronoff _did_ die at the outbreak of the Revolution.

""But--but who tried to kill him then?"" ""Nobody tried to kill _him_. Wilson was the intended victim all along."" ""But why?"" ""My friend, Savaronoff was the second greatest chess player in the world. In all probability Number Four did not even know the rudiments of the game. Certainly he could not sustain the fiction of a match. He tried all he knew to avoid the contest. When that failed, Wilson's doom was sealed. At all costs he must be prevented from discovering that the great Savaronoff did not even know how to play chess. Wilson was fond of the Ruy Lopez opening, and was certain to use it. Number Four arranged for death to come with the third move, before any complications of defence set in."" ""But, my dear Poirot,"" I persisted, ""are we dealing with a lunatic? I quite follow your reasoning, and admit that you must be right, but to kill a man just to sustain his rôle! Surely there were simpler ways out of the difficulty than that? He could have said that his doctor forbade the strain of a match."" Poirot wrinkled his forehead. ""_Certainement_, Hastings,"" he said, ""there were other ways, but none so convincing. Besides, you are assuming that to kill a man is a thing to avoid, are you not? Number Four's mind, it does not act that way. I put myself in his place, a thing impossible for you. I picture his thoughts. He enjoys himself as the professor at that match. I doubt not he has visited the chess tourneys to study his part. He sits and frowns in thought; he gives the impression that he is thinking great plans, and all the time he laughs in himself. He is aware that two moves are all that he knows--and all that he _need know_. Again, it would appeal to his mind to foresee the events and to make the man his own executioner at the exact time that suits Number Four.... Oh, yes, Hastings, I begin to understand our friend and his psychology."" I shrugged. ""Well, I suppose you're right, but I can't understand any one running a risk he could so easily avoid."" ""Risk!"" Poirot snorted. ""Where then lay the risk? Would Japp have solved the problem? No; if Number Four had not made one small mistake he would have run no risk."" ""And his mistake?""

""I was thinking, my friend, that at midsummer, when you first arrived, you told me that you proposed to be in this country for a couple of months only."" ""Did I say that?""

""More than you think, my friend. After all, we have established the identity of Number Two and Number Three, and we have learnt more than a little about the ways and methods of Number Four."" I brightened up a little. As Poirot put it, things didn't sound so bad. ""Oh! Yes, Hastings, we have done a great deal.

It would have been so easy for the Chinaman to come up and assure himself that I was keeping to the letter of the command. Why didn't he? His very abstention made me more suspicious. I had seen so much of the omnipotence of the Big Four that I credited them with almost super-human powers. For all I know, even the little bedraggled servant girl might be one of their agents. No, I dared not risk it. But one thing I could do, leave the telegram. He would know then that Cinderella had disappeared, and who was responsible for her disappearance. All this passed through my head in less time than it takes to tell, and I had clapped my hat on my head and was descending the stairs to where my guide waited, in a little over a minute. The bearer of the message was a tall impassive Chinaman, neatly but rather shabbily dressed. He bowed and spoke to me. His English was perfect, but he spoke with a slight sing-song intonation.

Bronsen was bound to cable me. They would wait until the cable was delivered and would strike hard upon it. No good could come of denying what was palpably true. ""Yes,"" I said. ""I did get a telegram."" ""You fetch him, yes? Fetch him now."" I ground my teeth, but what could I do. I ran upstairs again. As I did so, I thought of confiding in Mrs. Pearson, at any rate as far as Cinderella's disappearance went. She was on the landing, but close behind her was the little maid-servant, and I hesitated. If she _was_ a spy--the words of the note danced before my eyes. ""... she will suffer...."" I passed into the sitting-room without speaking. I took up the telegram and was about to pass out again when an idea struck me. Could I not leave some sign which would mean nothing to my enemies but which Poirot himself would find significant. I hurried across to the bookcase and tumbled out four books on to the floor. No fear of Poirot's not seeing them. They would outrage his eyes immediately--and coming on top of his little lecture, surely he would find them unusual. Next I put a shovelful of coal on the fire and managed to spill four knobs into the grate. I had done all I could--pray Heaven Poirot would read the sign aright. I hurried down again.

Once we took a bus and once we went for some considerable way in a train, and always our route led us steadily eastward. We went through strange districts, the existence of which I had never dreamed of. We were down by the docks now, I knew, and I realised that I was being taken into the heart of Chinatown. In spite of myself I shivered. Still my guide plodded on, turning and twisting through mean streets and byways, until at last he stopped at a dilapidated house and rapped four times upon the door. It was opened immediately by another Chinaman who stood aside to let us pass in. The clanging to of the door behind me was the knell of my last hopes. I was indeed in the hands of the enemy. I was now handed over to the second Chinaman. He led me down some rickety stairs and into a cellar which was filled with bales and casks and which exhaled a pungent odour, as of Eastern spices.

A whole section of the wall swung out, leaving a narrow doorway. I passed through, and to my utter astonishment found myself in a kind of Arabian Nights' palace. A low long subterranean chamber hung with rich oriental silks, brilliantly lighted and fragrant with perfumes and spices. There five or six silk covered divans, and exquisite carpets of Chinese workmanship covered the ground. At the end of the room was a curtained recess. From behind these curtains came a voice. ""You have brought our honoured guest?"" ""Excellency, he is here,"" replied my guide. ""Let our guest enter,"" was the answer. At the same moment, the curtains were drawn aside by an unseen hand, and I was facing an immense cushioned divan on which sat a tall thin Oriental dressed in wonderfully embroidered robes, and clearly, by the length of his finger nails, a great man. ""Be seated, I pray you, Captain Hastings,"" he said, with a wave of his hand. ""You acceded to my request to come immediately, I am glad to see."" ""Who are you?"" I asked. ""Li Chang Yen?"" ""Indeed no, I am but the humblest of the master's servants. I carry out his behests, that is all--as do other of his servants in other countries--in South America, for instance."" I advanced a step.

1,The Big Four,9,14. THE PEROXIDE BLONDE,1,"I was very disappointed with the results of Poirot's bomb attack on the premises in Chinatown. To begin with, the leader of the gang had escaped. When Japp's men rushed up in response to Poirot's whistle they found four Chinamen unconscious in the hall, but the man who had threatened me with death was not among them. I remembered afterwards that when I was forced out on to the doorstep, to decoy Poirot into the house, this man had kept well in the background. Presumably he was out of the danger zone of the gas bomb, and made good his escape by one of the many exits which we afterwards discovered. From the four who remained in our hands we learnt nothing. The fullest investigation by the police failed to bring to light anything to connect them with the Big Four. They were ordinary low-class residents of the district, and they professed bland ignorance of the name Li Chang Yen. A Chinese gentleman had hired them for service in the house by the waterside, and they knew nothing whatever of his private affairs. By the next day I had, except for a slight headache, completely recovered from the effects of Poirot's gas bomb. We went down together to Chinatown and searched the house from which I had been rescued. The premises consisted of two ramshackle houses joined together by an underground passage. The ground floors and the upper stories of each were unfurnished and deserted, the broken windows covered by decaying shutters. Japp had already been prying about in the cellars, and had discovered the secret of the entrance to the subterranean chamber where I had spent such an unpleasant half-hour. Closer investigation confirmed the impression that it had made on me the night before. The silks on the walls and divan and the carpets on the floors were of exquisite workmanship. Although I know very little about Chinese art, I could appreciate that every article in the room was perfect of its kind. With the aid of Japp and some of his men we conducted a most thorough search of the apartment. I had cherished high hopes that we would find documents of importance. A list, perhaps, of some of the more important agents of the Big Four, or cipher notes of some of their plans, but we discovered nothing of the kind. The only papers we found in the whole place were the notes which the Chinaman had consulted whilst he was dictating the letter to Poirot.

Personally I could not see that it was of any value whatever, especially as whoever compiled the notes was ludicrously mistaken in some of his opinions. I pointed this out to my friend when we were back in our rooms. ""My dear Poirot,"" I said, ""you know now what the enemy thinks of us. He appears to have a grossly exaggerated idea of your brain power, and to have absurdly underrated mine, but I do not see how we are better off for knowing this."" Poirot chuckled in rather an offensive way. ""You do not see, Hastings, no? But surely now we can prepare ourselves for some of their methods of attack now that we are warned of some of our faults. For instance my friend, we know that you should think before you act. Again, if you meet a red-haired young woman in trouble you should eye her--what you say--askance, is it not?"" Their notes had contained some absurd references to my supposed impulsiveness, and had suggested that I was susceptible to the charms of young women with hair of a certain shade. I thought Poirot's reference to be in the worst of taste, but fortunately I was able to counter him. ""And what about you?"" I demanded. ""Are you going to try to cure your 'overweening vanity?' Your 'finicky tidiness?'"" I was quoting, and I could see that he was not pleased with my retort. ""Oh, without doubt, Hastings, in some things they deceive themselves--_tant mieux_! They will learn in due time. Meanwhile we have learnt something, and to know is to be prepared."" This last was a favourite axiom of his lately; so much so that I had begun to hate the sound of it. ""We know something, Hastings,"" he continued. ""Yes, we know something--and that is to the good--but we do not know nearly enough. We must know more."" ""In what way?"" Poirot settled himself back in his chair, straightened a box of matches which I had thrown carelessly down on the table, and assumed an attitude that I knew only too well. I saw that he was prepared to hold forth at some length. ""See you, Hastings, we have to contend against four adversaries; that is, against four different personalities.

They are so much in the limelight that their movements must be carefully ordered. And so we come to the last member of the gang--we come to the man known as Number Four."" Poirot's voice altered a little, as it always did when speaking of this particular individual. ""Number Two and Number Three are able to succeed, to go on their way unscathed, owing to their notoriety and their assured position. Number Four succeeds for the opposite reason--he succeeds by the way of obscurity. Who is he? Nobody knows. What does he look like? Again nobody knows. How many times have we seen him, you and I? Five times, is it not? And could either of us say truthfully that we could be sure of recognising him again?"" I was forced to shake my head, as I ran back in my mind over those five different people who, incredible as it seemed, were one and the same man. The burly lunatic asylum keeper, the man in the buttoned up overcoat in Paris, James, the footman, the quiet young medical man in the Yellow Jasmine case, and the Russian Professor. In no way did any two of these people resemble each other. ""No,"" I said hopelessly. ""We've nothing to go by whatsoever."" Poirot smiled. ""Do not, I pray of you, give way to such enthusiastic despair. We know one or two things."" ""What kind of things?"" I asked sceptically. ""We know that he is a man of medium height, and of medium or fair colouring. If he were a tall man of swarthy complexion he could never have passed himself off as the fair stocky doctor. It is child's play, of course, to put on an additional inch or so for the part of James, or the Professor. In the same way he must have a short straight nose. Additions can be built on to a nose by skilful make up, but a large nose cannot be successfully reduced at a moment's notice.

Nothing alters the face so completely as a different set of teeth. You see where all this is leading us?"" ""Not exactly,"" I said cautiously. ""A man carries his profession written in his face, they say."" ""He's a criminal,"" I cried. ""He is an adept in the art of making up."" ""It's the same thing."" ""Rather a sweeping statement, Hastings, and one which would hardly be appreciated by the theatrical world. Do you not see that the man is, or has been, at one time or another, an actor?"" ""An actor?"" ""But certainly. He has the whole technique at his fingertips. Now there are two classes of actors, the one who sinks himself in his part, and the one who manages to impress his personality upon it. It is from the latter class that actor managers usually spring. They seize a part and mould it to their own personality. The former class is quite likely to spend its days doing Mr. Lloyd George at different music halls, or impersonating old men with beards in repertory plays. It is among that former class that we must look for our Number Four. He is a supreme artist in the way he sinks himself in each part he plays."" I was growing interested. ""So you fancy you may be able to trace his identity through his connection with the stage?"" ""Your reasoning is always brilliant, Hastings."" ""It might have been better,"" I said coldly, ""if the idea had come to you sooner. We have wasted a lot of time."" ""You are in error, _mon ami_. No more time has been wasted than was unavoidable. For some months now my agents have been engaged on the task. Joseph Aarons is one of them. You remember him?

I replaced the receiver and turned to Poirot, my eyes dancing with excitement. ""I say, Poirot, there's a woman there. Friend of Claud Darrell's. Miss Flossie Monro. McNeil wants you to come round."" ""At the instant!"" cried Poirot, disappearing into his bedroom, and reappearing with a hat. A taxi soon took us to our destination, and we were ushered into Mr. McNeil's private office. Sitting in the arm-chair facing the solicitor was a somewhat lurid looking lady no longer in her first youth. Her hair was of an impossible yellow, and was prolific in curls over each ear, her eyelids were heavily blackened, and she had by no means forgotten the rouge and the lip salve. ""Ah, here is M. Poirot!"" said Mr. McNeil. ""M. Poirot, this is Miss--er---Monro, who has very kindly called to give us some information."" ""Ah, but that is most kind!"" cried Poirot. He came forward with great empressement, and shook the lady warmly by the hand. ""Mademoiselle blooms like a flower in this dry-as-dust old office,"" he added, careless of the feelings of Mr. McNeil. This outrageous flattery was not without effect. Miss Monro blushed and simpered. ""Oh, go on now, Mr. Poirot!"" she exclaimed. ""I know what you Frenchmen are like."" ""Mademoiselle, we are not mute like Englishmen before beauty. Not that I am a Frenchman--I am a Belgian, you see."" ""I've been to Ostend myself,"" said Miss Monro. The whole affair, as Poirot would have said, was marching splendidly. ""And so you can tell us something about Mr. Claud Darrell?"" continued Poirot. ""I knew Mr. Darrell very well at one time,"" explained the lady. ""And I saw your advertisement, being out of a shop for the moment, and my time being my own, I said to myself: There, they want to know about poor old Claudie--lawyers, too--maybe it's a fortune looking for the rightful heir, I'd better go round at once."" Mr. McNeil rose. ""Well, Monsieur Poirot, shall I leave you for a little conversation with Miss Monro?"" ""You are too amiable. But stay--a little idea presents itself to me. The hour of the _déjeuner_ approaches. Mademoiselle will perhaps honour me by coming out to luncheon with me?"" Miss Monro's eyes glistened. It struck me that she was in exceedingly low water, and that the chance of a square meal was not to be despised. A few minutes later saw us all in a taxi, bound for one of London's most expensive restaurants.

Poirot replenished the lady's glass with thoughtful assiduity, and gradually slid on to the topic nearest his heart. ""The poor Mr. Darrell. What a pity he is not with us."" ""Yes, indeed,"" sighed Miss Monro. ""Poor boy, I do wonder what's become of him."" ""It is a long time since you have seen him, yes?"" ""Oh, simply ages--not since the war. He was a funny boy, Claudie, very close about things, never told you a word about himself. But, of course, that all fits in if he's a missing heir. Is it a title, Mr. Poirot?"" ""Alas, a mere heritage,"" said Poirot unblushingly. ""But you see, it may be a question of identification. That is why it is necessary for us to find some one who knew him very well indeed. You knew him very well, did you not, mademoiselle."" ""I don't mind telling you, Mr. Poirot. You're a gentleman. You know how to order a lunch for a lady--which is more than some of these young whippersnappers do nowadays. Downright mean, I call it. As I was saying, you being a Frenchman won't be shocked. Ah, you Frenchmen! Naughty, naughty!"" She wagged her finger at him in an excess of archness. ""Well, there it was, me and Claudie, two young things--what else could you expect? And I've still a kindly feeling for him. Though, mind you, he didn't treat me well--no, he didn't--he didn't treat me well at all. Not as a lady should be treated. They're all the same when it comes to a question of money."" ""No, no, mademoiselle, do not say that,"" protested Poirot, filling up her glass once more. ""Could you now describe this Mr. Darrell to me?"" ""He wasn't anything so very much to look at,"" said Flossie Monro dreamily. ""Neither tall nor short, you know, but quite well set up. Spruce looking. Eyes a sort of blue-gray. And more or less fair-haired, I suppose. But oh, what an artist! _I_ never saw any one to touch him in the profession! He'd have made his name before now if it hadn't been for jealousy. Ah, Mr. Poirot, jealousy--you wouldn't believe it, you really wouldn't, what we artists have to suffer through jealousy.

1,The Big Four,9,14. THE PEROXIDE BLONDE,8,"that you are able to tell us, mademoiselle, about Mr. Darrell. Women are such wonderful observers--they see everything, they notice the little detail that escapes the mere man. I have seen a woman identify one man out of a dozen others--and why, do you think? She had observed that he had a trick of stroking his nose when he was agitated. Now would a man ever have thought of noticing a thing like that?"" ""Did you ever!"" cried Miss Monro. ""I suppose we do notice things. I remember Claudie, now I come to think of it, always fiddling with his bread at table. He'd get a little piece between his fingers and then dab it round to pick up crumbs. I've seen him do it a hundred times. Why, I'd know him anywhere by that one trick of his."" ""Is not that just what I say? The marvellous observation of a woman. And did you ever speak to him about this little habit of his, mademoiselle?"" ""No, I didn't, Mr. Poirot. You know what men are! They don't like you to notice things especially if it should seem you were telling them off about it. I never said a word--but many's the time I smiled to myself. Bless you, he never knew he was doing it even."" Poirot nodded gently. I noticed that his own hand was shaking a little as he stretched it out to his glass. ""Then there is always handwriting as a means of establishing identity,"" he remarked. ""Without doubt you have preserved a letter written by Mr. Darrell?"" Flossie Monro shook her head regretfully. ""He was never one for writing. Never wrote me a line in his life."" ""That is a pity,"" said Poirot. ""I tell you what, though,"" said Miss Monro suddenly.

""_Ça ne fait rien!_ No matter how old and faded! Ah, _ma foi_, but what stupendous luck! You will permit me to inspect that photograph, mademoiselle?"" ""Why, of course.""

""I'm willing."" ""Let me see, I do not think that I have your address?"" With a grand air, Miss Monro drew a card from her hand-bag, and handed it to him. It was a somewhat dirty card, and the original address had been scratched out and another substituted in pencil. Then, with a good many bows and gesticulations on Poirot's part, we bade farewell to the lady and got away. ""Do you really think this photograph so important?"" I asked Poirot. ""Yes, _mon ami_. The camera does not lie. One can magnify a photograph, seize salient points that otherwise would remain unnoticed. And then there are a thousand details--such as the structure of the ears, which no one could ever describe to you in words. Oh, yes, it is a great chance, this which has come our way! That is why I propose to take precautions."" He went across to the telephone as he finished speaking, and gave a number which I knew to be that of a private detective agency which he sometimes employed. His instructions were clear and definite. Two men were to go to the address he gave, and, in general terms, were to watch over the safety of Miss Monro. They were to follow her wherever she went. Poirot hung up the receiver and came back to me. ""Do you really think that necessary, Poirot?"" I asked. ""It may be. There is no doubt that we are watched, you and I, and since that is so, they will soon know with whom we were lunching to-day. And it is possible that Number Four will scent danger."" About twenty minutes later the telephone bell rang. I answered it. A curt voice spoke into the phone. ""Is that Mr. Poirot? St. James Hospital speaking. A young woman was brought in ten minutes ago. Street accident. Miss Flossie Monro. She is asking very urgently for Mr. Poirot. But he must come at once. She can't possibly last long."" I repeated the words to Poirot. His face went white. ""Quick, Hastings. We must go like the wind."" A taxi took us to the hospital in less than ten minutes. We asked for Miss Monro, and were taken immediately to the accident ward. But a white-capped sister met us in the doorway. Poirot read the news in her face. ""It is over, eh?"" ""She died six minutes ago."" Poirot stood as though stunned. The nurse, mistaking his emotion, began speaking gently.

Wicked, isn't it? I hope some one took the number."" ""The stars fight against us,"" said Poirot, in a low voice. ""You would like to see her?"" The nurse led the way, and we followed. Poor Flossie Monro, with her rouge and her dyed hair. She lay there very peacefully, with a little smile on her lips. ""Yes,"" murmured Poirot. ""The stars fight against us--but is it the stars?"" He lifted his head as though struck by a sudden idea. ""Is it the stars, Hastings? If it is not--if it is not.... Oh, I swear to you, my friend, standing here by this poor woman's body, that I will have no mercy when the time comes!"" ""What do you mean?"" I asked. But Poirot had turned to the nurse and was eagerly demanding information. A list of the articles found in her hand-bag was finally obtained. Poirot gave a suppressed cry as he read it over. ""You see, Hastings, you see?"" ""See what?"" ""There is no mention of a latch-key. But she must have had a latch-key with her. No, she was run down in cold blood, and the first person who bent over her took the key from her bag. But we may yet be in time. He may not have been able to find at once what he sought."" Another taxi took us to the address Flossie Monro had given us, a squalid block of Mansions in an unsavoury neighbourhood. It was some time before we could gain admission to Miss Monro's flat, but we had at least the satisfaction of knowing that no one could leave it whilst we were on guard outside. Eventually we got in. It was plain that some one had been before us. The contents of drawers and cupboards were strewn all over the floor. Locks had been forced, and small tables had even been overthrown, so violent had been the searcher's haste. Poirot began to hunt through the débris. Suddenly he stood erect with a cry, holding out something. It was an old fashioned photograph frame--empty. He turned it slowly over. Affixed to the back was a small round label--a price label. ""It cost four shillings,"" I commented. ""_Mon Dieu!_ Hastings, use your eyes. That is a new clean label.

1,The Big Four,10,15. THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE,1,"It was after the tragic death of Miss Flossie Monro that I began to be aware of a change in Poirot. Up to now, his invincible confidence in himself had stood the test. But it seemed as though, at last, the long strain was beginning to tell. His manner was grave and brooding, and his nerves were on edge. In these days he was as jumpy as a cat. He avoided all discussion of the Big Four as far as possible, and seemed to throw himself into his ordinary work with almost his old ardour. Nevertheless, I knew that he was secretly active in the big matter. Extraordinary-looking Slavs were constantly calling to see him, and though he vouchsafed no explanation as to these mysterious activities, I realised that he was building some new defence or weapon of opposition with the help of these somewhat repulsive-looking foreigners. Once, purely by chance, I happened to see the entries in his pass-book--he had asked me to verify some small item--and I noticed the paying out of a huge sum--a huge sum even for Poirot who was coining money nowadays--to some Russian with apparently every letter of the alphabet in his name. But he gave no clue as to the line on which he proposed to operate. Only over and over again he gave utterance to one phrase. ""It is the greatest mistake to underestimate your adversary. Remember that, _mon ami_."" And I realised that that was the pitfall he was striving at all costs to avoid. So matters went on until the end of March, and then one morning Poirot made a remark which startled me considerably. ""This morning, my friend, I should recommend the best suit. We go to call upon the Home Secretary."" ""Indeed? That is very exciting. He has called you in to take up a case?"" ""Not exactly. The interview is of my seeking. You may remember my saying that I once did him some small service? He is inclined to be foolishly enthusiastic over my capabilities in consequence, and I am about to trade on this attitude of his. As you know, the French Premier, M. Desjardeaux is over in London, and at my request the Home Secretary had arranged for him to be present at our little conference this morning.""

A man of some fifty years of age, with a quizzical expression and shrewd gray eyes, he received us with that delightful bonhomie of manner which was well known to be one of his principal assets. Standing with his back to the fireplace was a tall thin man with a pointed black beard and a sensitive face. ""M. Desjardeaux,"" said Crowther. ""Allow me to introduce to you M. Hercule Poirot of whom you may, perhaps, already have heard."" The Frenchman bowed and shook hands. ""I have indeed heard of M. Hercule Poirot,"" he said pleasantly. ""Who has not?"" ""You are too amiable, monsieur,"" said Poirot, bowing, but his face flushed with pleasure. ""Any word for an old friend?"" asked a quiet voice, and a man came forward from a corner by a tall bookcase. It was our old acquaintance, Mr. Ingles. Poirot shook him warmly by the hand. ""And now, M. Poirot,"" said Crowther. ""We are at your service. I understood you to say that you had a communication of the utmost importance to make to us."" ""That is so, monsieur. There is in the world to-day a vast organisation--an organisation of crime. It is controlled by four individuals, who are known and spoken of as the Big Four. Number One is a Chinaman, Li Chang Yen; Number Two is the American multi-millionaire, Abe Ryland; Number Three is a Frenchwoman; Number Four I have every reason to believe is an obscure English actor called Claud Darrell. These four are banded together to destroy the existing social order, and to replace it with an anarchy in which they would reign as dictators."" ""Incredible,"" muttered the Frenchman. ""Ryland, mixed up with a thing of that kind? Surely the idea is too fantastic."" ""Listen, monsieur, whilst I recount to you some of the doings of this Big Four."" It was an enthralling narrative which Poirot unfolded. Familiar as I was with all the details, they thrilled me anew as I heard the bald recital of our adventures and escapes. M. Desjardeaux looked mutely at Mr. Crowther as Poirot finished. The other answered the look. ""Yes, M. Desjardeaux, I think we must admit the existence of a 'Big Four.'

I have been asked not to give them to the public even now, and so I refrain from doing so, but they included the extraordinary disasters to submarines which occurred in a certain month, and also a series of aeroplane accidents and forced landings. According to Poirot, these were all the work of the Big Four, and bore witness to the fact that they were in possession of various scientific secrets unknown to the world at large. This brought us straight to the question which I had been waiting for the French Premier to ask. ""You say that the third member of this organisation is a Frenchwoman. Have you any idea of her name?"" ""It is a well-known name, monsieur. An honoured name. Number Three is no less than the famous Madame Olivier."" At the mention of the world-famous scientist, successor to the Curies, M. Desjardeaux positively bounded from his chair, his face purple with emotion. ""Madame Olivier! Impossible! Absurd! It is an insult what you say there!"" Poirot shook his head gently, but made no answer. Desjardeaux looked at him in stupefaction for some moments. Then his face cleared, and he glanced at the Home Secretary and tapped his forehead significantly. ""M. Poirot is a great man,"" he observed. ""But even the great man--sometimes he has his little mania, does he not? And seeks in high places for fancied conspiracies. It is well known. You agree with me, do you not, Mr. Crowther?"" The Home Secretary did not answer for some minutes. Then he spoke slowly and heavily. ""Upon my soul, I don't know,"" he said at last. ""I have always had and still have the utmost belief in M. Poirot, but--well, this takes a bit of believing."" ""This Li Chang Yen, too,"" continued M. Desjardeaux. ""Who has ever heard of him?"" ""I have,"" said the unexpected voice of Mr. Ingles. The Frenchman stared at him, and he stared placidly back again, looking more like a Chinese idol than ever. ""Mr. Ingles,"" explained the Home Secretary, ""is the greatest authority we have on the interior of China."" ""And you have heard of this Li Chang Yen?"" ""Until M.

Desjardeaux sat as though stunned. Presently, however, he rallied. ""There may be something in what you say, M. Poirot,"" he said coldly. ""But as regards Madame Olivier, you are most certainly mistaken. She is a true daughter of France, and devoted solely to the cause of science."" Poirot shrugged his shoulders and did not answer. There was a minute or two's pause, and then my little friend rose to his feet, with an air of dignity that sat rather oddly upon his quaint personality. ""That is all I have to say, messieurs--to warn you. I thought it likely that I should not be believed. But at least you will be on your guard. My words will sink in, and each fresh event that comes along will confirm your wavering faith. It was necessary for me to speak now--later I might not have been able to do so."" ""You mean--?"" asked Crowther, impressed in spite of himself by the gravity of Poirot's tone. ""I mean, monsieur, that since I have penetrated the identity of Number Four, my life is not worth an hour's purchase. He will seek to destroy me at all costs--and not for nothing is he named 'The Destroyer.' Messieurs, I salute you. To you, M. Crowther, I deliver this key, and this sealed envelope. I have got together all my notes on the case, and my ideas as to how best to meet the menace that any day may break upon the world, and have placed them in a certain safe deposit. In the event of my death, M. Crowther, I authorise you to take charge of those papers and make what use you can of them. And now, messieurs, I wish you good day."" Desjardeaux merely bowed coldly, but Crowther sprang up and held out his hand. ""You have converted me, M. Poirot. Fantastic as the whole thing seems, I believe utterly in the truth of what you have told us."" Ingles left at the same time as we did. ""I am not disappointed with the interview,"" said Poirot, as we walked along. ""I did not expect to convince Desjardeaux, but I have at least ensured that, if I die, my knowledge does not die with me.

""No,"" said Ingles dryly. ""But it's necessary. One must do what one can."" ""Ah, you are a brave man!"" cried Poirot with emotion. ""If we were not in the street, I would embrace you."" I fancied that Ingles looked rather relieved. ""I don't suppose that I shall be in any more danger in China than you are in London,"" he growled. ""That is possibly true enough,"" admitted Poirot. ""I hope that they will not succeed in massacring Hastings also, that is all. That would annoy me greatly."" I interrupted this cheerful conversation to remark that I had no intention of letting myself be massacred, and shortly afterwards Ingles parted from us. For some time we went along in silence, which Poirot at length broke by uttering a totally unexpected remark. ""I think--I really think--that I shall have to bring my brother into this."" ""Your brother,"" I cried, astonished. ""I never knew you had a brother?"" ""You surprise me, Hastings. Do you not know that all celebrated detectives have brothers who would be even more celebrated then they are were it not for constitutional indolence?"" Poirot employs a peculiar manner sometimes which makes it wellnigh impossible to know whether he is jesting or in earnest. That manner was very evident at the moment. ""What is your brother's name?"" I asked, trying to adjust myself to this new idea. ""Achille Poirot,"" replied Poirot gravely. ""He lives near Spa in Belgium."" ""What does he do?"" I asked with some curiosity, putting aside a half-formed wonder as to the character and disposition of the late Madame Poirot, and her classical taste in Christian names. ""He does nothing. He is, as I tell, of a singularly indolent disposition. But his abilities are hardly less than my own--which is saying a great deal."" ""Is he like you to look at?"" ""Not unlike. But not nearly so handsome. And he wears no moustaches."" ""Is he older than you, or younger?"" ""He happens to have been born on the same day."" ""A twin,"" I cried. ""Exactly, Hastings.

1,The Big Four,10,15. THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE,6,"necklace was doomed to wait awhile. A case of quite another description was waiting for us. Our landlady, Mrs. Pearson, at once informed us that a hospital nurse had called and was waiting to see Poirot. We found her sitting in the big arm-chair facing the window, a pleasant-faced woman of middle age, in a dark blue uniform. She was a little reluctant to come to the point, but Poirot soon put her at her ease, and she embarked upon her story. ""You see, M. Poirot, I've never come across anything of the kind before. I was sent for, from the Lark Sisterhood, to go down to a case in Hertfordshire. An old gentleman, it is, Mr. Templeton. Quite a pleasant house, and quite pleasant people. The wife, Mrs. Templeton, is much younger than her husband, and he has a son by his first marriage who lives there. I don't know that the young man and the step-mother always get on together. He's not quite what you'd call normal--not 'wanting' exactly, but decidedly dull in the intellect. Well, this illness of Mr. Templeton's seemed to me from the first to be very mysterious. At times there seemed really nothing the matter with him, and then he suddenly has one of these gastric attacks with pain and vomiting. But the doctor seemed quite satisfied, and it wasn't for me to say anything. But I couldn't help thinking about it. And then--"" She paused, and became rather red. ""Something happened which aroused your suspicions?"" suggested Poirot. ""Yes."" But she still seemed to find it difficult to go on. ""I found the servants were passing remarks too."" ""About Mr. Templeton's illness?"" ""Oh, no! About--about this other thing--"" ""Mrs. Templeton?"" ""Yes."" ""Mrs. Templeton and the doctor, perhaps?"" Poirot had an uncanny flair in these things. The nurse threw him a grateful glance and went on. ""They _were_ passing remarks. And then one day I happened to see them together myself--in the garden--"" It was left at that. Our client was in such an agony of outraged propriety that no one could feel it necessary to ask exactly what she had seen in the garden. She had evidently seen quite enough to make up her own mind on the situation. ""The attacks got worse and worse.

It seemed to me much more like some form of--"" She paused, hesitating. ""Arsenical poisoning?"" said Poirot helpfully. She nodded. ""And then, too, he, the patient, I mean, said something queer. 'They'll do for me, the four of them. They'll do for me yet.'"" ""Eh?"" said Poirot quickly. ""Those were his very words, M. Poirot. He was in great pain at the time, of course, and hardly knew what he was saying."" ""'They'll do for me, the four of them,'"" repeated Poirot thoughtfully. ""What did he mean by 'the four of them,' do you think?"" ""That I can't say, M. Poirot. I thought perhaps he meant his wife and son, and the doctor, and perhaps Miss Clark, Mrs. Templeton's companion. That would make four, wouldn't it? He might think they were all in league against him."" ""Quite so, quite so,"" said Poirot, in a preoccupied voice. ""What about food? Could you take no precautions about that?"" ""I'm always doing what I can. But, of course, sometimes Mrs. Templeton insists on bringing him his food herself, and then there are the times when I am off duty."" ""Exactly. And you are not sure enough of your ground to go to the police?"" The nurse's face showed her horror at the mere idea. ""What I have done, M. Poirot, is this. Mr. Templeton had a very bad attack after partaking of a bowl of soup. I took a little from the bottom of the bowl afterwards, and have brought it up with me. I have been spared for the day to visit a sick mother, as Mr. Templeton was well enough to be left."" She drew out a little bottle of dark fluid and handed it to Poirot. ""Excellent, mademoiselle. We will have this analysed immediately. If you will return here in, say, an hour's time I think that we shall be able to dispose of your suspicions one way or another."" First extracting from our visitor her name and qualifications, he ushered her out. Then he wrote a note and sent it off together with the bottle of soup. Whilst we waited to hear the result, Poirot amused himself by verifying the nurse's credentials, somewhat to my surprise. ""No, no, my friend,"" he declared. ""I do well to be careful.

However, he soon elicited the information that a nurse of the name of Mabel Palmer was a member of the Lark Institute and had been sent to the case in question. ""So far, so good,"" he said, with a twinkle. ""And now here comes Nurse Palmer back again, and here also is our analyst's report."" Both the nurse and I waited anxiously whilst Poirot read the analyst's report. ""Is there arsenic in it?"" she asked breathlessly. Poirot shook his head, refolding the paper. ""No."" We were both immeasurably surprised. ""There is no arsenic in it,"" continued Poirot. ""But there is antimony. And that being the case, we will start immediately for Hertfordshire. Pray Heaven that we are not too late."" It was decided that the simplest plan was for Poirot to represent himself truly as a detective, but that the ostensible reason of his visit should be to question Mrs. Templeton about a servant formerly in her employment whose name he obtained from Nurse Palmer, and who he could represent as being concerned in a jewel robbery. It was late when we arrived at Elmstead, as the house was called. We had allowed Nurse Palmer to precede us by about twenty minutes, so that there should be no question of our all arriving together. Mrs. Templeton, a tall dark woman, with sinuous movements and uneasy eyes, received us. I noticed that as Poirot announced his profession, she drew in her breath with a sudden hiss, as though badly startled, but she answered his question about the maid-servant readily enough. And then, to test her, Poirot embarked upon a long history of a poisoning case in which a guilty wife had figured. His eyes never left her face as he talked, and try as she would, she could hardly conceal her rising agitation. Suddenly, with an incoherent word of excuse, she hurried from the room. We were not long left alone. A squarely-built man with a small red moustache and pince-nez came in. ""Dr. Treves,"" he introduced himself. ""Mrs. Templeton asked me to make her excuses to you. She's in a very bad state, you know. Nervous strain. Worry over her husband and all that. I've prescribed bed and bromide. But she hopes you'll stay and take pot luck, and I'm to do host.

1,The Big Four,10,15. THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE,9,"you. Ah, here's Micky!"" A shambling young man entered the room. He had a very round face, and foolish-looking eyebrows raised as though in perpetual surprise. He grinned awkwardly as he shook hands. This was clearly the ""wanting"" son. Presently we all went in to dinner. Dr. Treves left the room--to open some wine, I think---and suddenly the boy's physiognomy underwent a startling change. He leant forward, staring at Poirot. ""You've come about father,"" he said, nodding his head. ""_I_ know. I know lots of things--but nobody thinks I do. Mother will be glad when father's dead and she can marry Dr. Treves. She isn't my own mother, you know. I don't like her. She wants father to die."" It was all rather horrible. Luckily, before Poirot had time to reply, the doctor came back, and we had to carry on a forced conversation. And then suddenly Poirot lay back in his chair with a hollow groan. His face was contorted with pain. ""My dear sir, what's the matter?"" cried the doctor. ""A sudden spasm. I am used to them. No, no, I require no assistance from you, doctor. If I might lie down upstairs."" His request was instantly acceded to, and I accompanied him upstairs, where he collapsed on the bed, groaning heavily. For the first minute or two I had been taken in, but I had quickly realised that Poirot was--as he would have put it--playing the comedy, and that his object was to be left alone upstairs near the patient's room. Hence I was quite prepared when, the instant we were alone, he sprang up. ""Quick, Hastings, the window. There is ivy outside. We can climb down before they begin to suspect."" ""Climb down?"" ""Yes, we must get out of this house at once. You saw him at dinner?"" ""The doctor?"" ""No, young Templeton. His trick with his bread. Do you remember what Flossie Monro told us before she died? That Claud Darrell had a habit of dabbing his bread on the table to pick up crumbs. Hastings, this is a vast plot, and that vacant-looking young man is our arch enemy--Number Four! Hurry.""

""How many of them were in it, I wonder? I suspect that the whole Templeton family are just so many agents of the Big Four. Did they simply want to decoy us down there? Or was it more subtle than that. Did they intend to play the comedy down there and keep me interested until they had had time to do--what? I wonder now."" He remained very thoughtful. Arrived at our lodgings, he restrained me at the door of the sitting-room. ""Attention, Hastings. I have my suspicions. Let me enter first."" He did so, and, to my slight amusement, took the precaution to press on the electric switch with an old galosh. Then he went round the room like a strange cat, cautiously, delicately, on the alert for danger. I watched him for some time, remaining obediently where I had been put by the wall. ""It's all right, Poirot,"" I said impatiently. ""It seems so, _mon ami_, it seems so. But let us make sure."" ""Rot,"" I said. ""I shall light the fire, anyway, and have a pipe. I've caught you out for once. You had the matches last and you didn't put them back in the holder as usual--the very thing you're always cursing me for doing."" I stretched out my hand. I heard Poirot's warning cry--saw him leaping towards me--my hand touched the match-box. Then--a flash of blue flame--an ear-rending crash--and darkness-- I came to myself to find the familiar face of our old friend Dr. Ridgeway bending over me. An expression of relief passed over his features. ""Keep still,"" he said soothingly. ""You're all right. There's been an accident, you know."" ""Poirot?"" I murmured. ""You're in my digs. Everything's quite all right."" A cold fear clutched at my heart. His evasion woke a horrible fear. ""Poirot?"" I reiterated. ""What of Poirot."" He saw that I had to know and that further evasions were useless. ""By a miracle you escaped--Poirot--did not!"" A cry burst from my lips. ""Not dead? Not dead?"" Ridgeway bowed his head, his features working with emotion. With desperate energy I pulled myself to a sitting position. ""Poirot may be dead,"" I said weakly. ""But his spirit lives on. I will carry on his work! Death to the Big Four!"" Then I fell back, fainting.","['catch', 'last', 'train', '8.34', 'would', 'land', 'us', 'town', 'eleven', ""o'clock"", 'A', 'plot', 'said', 'Poirot', 'thoughtfully', 'How', 'many', 'I', 'wonder', 'I', 'suspect', 'whole', 'Templeton', 'family', 'many', 'agents', 'Big', 'Four', 'Did', 'simply', 'want', 'decoy', 'us', 'Or', 'subtle', 'Did', 'intend', 'play', 'comedy', 'keep', 'interested', 'time', '--', 'I', 'wonder', 'He', 'remained', 'thoughtful', 'Arrived', 'lodgings', 'restrained', 'door', 'sitting', 'room', 'Attention', 'Hastings', 'I', 'suspicions', 'Let', 'enter', 'first', 'He', 'slight', 'amusement', 'took', 'precaution', 'press', 'electric', 'switch', 'old', 'galosh', 'Then', 'went', 'round', 'room', 'like', 'strange', 'cat', 'cautiously', 'delicately', 'alert', 'danger', 'I', 'watched', 'time', 'remaining', 'obediently', 'I', 'put', 'wall', 'It', ""'s"", 'right', 'Poirot', 'I', 'said', 'impatiently', 'It', 'seems', 'mon', 'ami', 'seems', 'But', 'let', 'us', 'make', 'sure', 'Rot', 'I', 'said', 'I', 'shall', 'light', 'fire', 'anyway', 'pipe', 'I', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'You', 'matches', 'last', ""n't"", 'put', 'back', 'holder', 'usual', '--', 'thing', ""'re"", 'always', 'cursing', 'I', 'stretched', 'hand', 'I', 'heard', 'Poirot', ""'s"", 'warning', 'cry', '--', 'saw', 'leaping', 'towards', '--', 'hand', 'touched', 'match', 'box', 'Then', '--', 'flash', 'blue', 'flame', '--', 'ear', 'rending', 'crash', '--', 'darkness--', 'I', 'came', 'find', 'familiar', 'face', 'old', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Ridgeway', 'bending', 'An', 'expression', 'relief', 'passed', 'features', 'Keep', 'still', 'said', 'soothingly', 'You', ""'re"", 'right', 'There', ""'s"", 'accident', 'know', 'Poirot', 'I', 'murmured', 'You', ""'re"", 'digs', 'Everything', ""'s"", 'quite', 'right', 'A', 'cold', 'fear', 'clutched', 'heart', 'His', 'evasion', 'woke', 'horrible', 'fear', 'Poirot', 'I', 'reiterated', 'What', 'Poirot', 'He', 'saw', 'I', 'know', 'evasions', 'useless', 'By', 'miracle', 'escaped', '--', 'Poirot', '--', 'A', 'cry', 'burst', 'lips', 'Not', 'dead', 'Not', 'dead', 'Ridgeway', 'bowed', 'head', 'features', 'working', 'emotion', 'With', 'desperate', 'energy', 'I', 'pulled', 'sitting', 'position', 'Poirot', 'may', 'dead', 'I', 'said', 'weakly', 'But', 'spirit', 'lives', 'I', 'carry', 'work', 'Death', 'Big', 'Four', 'Then', 'I', 'fell', 'back', 'fainting']"
1,The Big Four,11,16. THE DYING CHINAMAN,1,"Even now I can hardly bear to write of those days in March. Poirot--the unique, the inimitable Hercule Poirot--dead! There was a particularly diabolical touch in the disarranged match-box, which was certain to catch his eye, and which he would hasten to rearrange--and thereby touch off the explosion. That, as a matter of fact, it was I who actually precipitated the catastrophe never ceased to fill me with unavailing remorse. It was, as Doctor Ridgeway said, a perfect miracle that I had not been killed, but had escaped with a slight concussion. Although it had seemed to me as though I regained consciousness almost immediately, it was in reality over twenty-four hours before I came back to life. It was not until the evening of the day following that I was able to stagger feebly into an adjoining room, and view with deep emotion the plain elm coffin which held the remains of one of the most marvellous men this world has ever known. From the very first moment of regaining consciousness I had only one purpose in mind--to avenge Poirot's death, and to hunt down the Big Four remorselessly. I had thought that Ridgeway would have been of one mind with me about this, but to my surprise the good doctor seemed unaccountably lukewarm. ""Get back to South America"" was his advice, tendered on every occasion. Why attempt the impossible? Put as delicately as possible, his opinion amounted to this:--If Poirot, the unique Poirot, had failed, was it likely that I should succeed? But I was obstinate. Putting aside any question as to whether I had the necessary qualifications for the task (and I may say in passing that I did not entirely agree with his views on this point), I had worked so long with Poirot that I knew his methods by heart, and felt fully capable of taking up the work where he had laid it down; it was, with me, a question of feeling. My friend had been foully murdered. Was I to go tamely back to South America without an effort to bring his murderers to justice? I said all this and more to Ridgeway, who listened attentively enough. ""All the same,"" he said when I had finished, ""my advice does not vary. I am earnestly convinced that Poirot himself, if he were here, would urge you to return. In his name, I beg of you, Hastings, abandon these wild ideas and go back to your ranch.""

1,The Big Four,11,16. THE DYING CHINAMAN,2,"answer was possible, and, shaking his head sadly, he said no more. It was a month before I was fully restored to health. Towards the end of April, I sought, and obtained, an interview with the Home Secretary. Mr. Crowther's manner was reminiscent of that of Dr. Ridgeway. It was soothing and negative. Whilst appreciating the offer of my services, he gently and considerately declined them. The papers referred to by Poirot had passed into his keeping, and he assured me that all possible steps were being taken to deal with the approaching menace. With that cold comfort I was forced to be satisfied. Mr. Crowther ended the interview by urging me to return to South America. I found the whole thing profoundly unsatisfactory. I should, I suppose, in its proper place, have described Poirot's funeral. It was a solemn and moving ceremony, and the extraordinary number of floral tributes passed belief. They came from high and low alike, and bore striking testimony to the place my friend had made for himself in the country of his adoption. For myself, I was frankly overcome by emotion as I stood by the grave side and thought of all our varied experiences and the happy days we had passed together. By the beginning of May I had mapped out a plan of campaign. I felt that I could not do better than keep Poirot's scheme of advertising for any information respecting Claud Darrell. I had an advertisement to this effect inserted in a number of morning newspapers, and I was sitting in a small restaurant in Soho, and judging of the effect of the advertisement, when a small paragraph in another part of the paper gave me a nasty shock. Very briefly, it reported the mysterious disappearance of Mr. John Ingles from the _S.S. Shanghai_ shortly after the latter had left Marseilles. Although the weather was perfectly smooth, it was feared that the unfortunate gentleman must have fallen overboard. The paragraph ended with a brief reference to Mr. Ingles's long and distinguished service in China. The news was unpleasant. I read into Ingles's death a sinister motive. Not for one moment did I believe the theory of an accident. Ingles had been murdered, and his death was only too clearly the handiwork of that accursed Big Four. As I sat there, stunned by the blow, and turning the whole matter over in my mind, I was startled by the remarkable behaviour of the man sitting opposite me.

1,The Big Four,11,16. THE DYING CHINAMAN,3,"far I had not paid much attention to him. He was a thin, dark man of middle age, sallow of complexion, with a small pointed beard. He had sat down opposite me so quietly that I had hardly noticed his arrival. But his actions now were decidedly peculiar, to say the least of them. Leaning forward, he deliberately helped me to salt, putting it in four little heaps round the edge of my plate. ""You will excuse me,"" he said, in a melancholy voice. ""To help a stranger to salt is to help them to sorrow, they say. That may be an unavoidable necessity. I hope not, though. I hope that you will be reasonable."" Then, with a certain significance, he repeated his operations with the salt on his own plate. The symbol 4 was too plain to be missed. I looked at him searchingly. In no way that I could see did he resemble young Templeton, or James the footman, or any other of the various personalities we had come across. Nevertheless, I was convinced that I had to do with no less than the redoubtable Number Four himself. In his voice there was certainly a faint resemblance to the buttoned-up-stranger who had called upon us in Paris. I looked round, undecided as to my course of action. Reading my thoughts, he smiled and gently shook his head. ""I should not advise it,"" he remarked. ""Remember what came of your hasty action in Paris. Let me assure you that my way of retreat is well assured. Your ideas are inclined to be a little crude, Captain Hastings, if I may say so."" ""You devil,"" I said, choking with rage, ""you incarnate devil!"" ""Heated--just a trifle heated. Your late lamented friend would have told you that a man who keeps calm has always a great advantage."" ""You dare to speak of him,"" I cried. ""The man you murdered so foully. And you come here--"" He interrupted me. ""I came here for an excellent and peaceful purpose. To advise you to return at once to South America. If you do so, that is the end of the matter as far as the Big Four are concerned. You and yours will not be molested in any way. I give you my word as to that."" I laughed scornfully. ""And if I refuse to obey your autocratic command?"" ""It is hardly a command. Shall we say that it is--a warning?"" There was a cold menace in his tone.

Then, before I had any hint of his intention, he rose and slipped quickly away towards the door. I sprang to my feet and was after him in a second, but by bad luck I cannoned straight into an enormously fat man who blocked the way between me and the next table. By the time I had disentangled myself, my quarry was just passing through the doorway, and the next delay was from a waiter carrying a huge pile of plates who crashed into me without the least warning. By the time I got to the door there was no sign of the thin man with the dark beard. The waiter was fulsome in apologies, the fat man was sitting placidly at a table ordering his lunch. There was nothing to show that both occurrences had not been a pure accident. Nevertheless, I had my own opinion as to that. I knew well enough that the agents of the Big Four were everywhere. Needless to say, I paid no heed to the warning given me. I would do or die in the good cause. I received in all only two answers to the advertisements. Neither of them gave me any information of value. They were both from actors who had played with Claud Darrell at one time or another. Neither of them knew him at all intimately, and no new light was thrown upon the problem of his identity and present whereabouts. No further sign came from the Big Four until about ten days later. I was crossing Hyde Park, lost in thought, when a voice, rich with a persuasive foreign inflection, hailed me. ""Captain Hastings, is it not?"" A big limousine had just drawn up by the pavement. A woman was leaning out. Exquisitely dressed in black, with wonderful pearls, I recognised the lady first known to us as Countess Vera Rossakoff, and afterwards under a different alias as an agent of the Big Four. Poirot, for some reason or other, had always had a sneaking fondness for the countess. Something in her very flamboyance attracted the little man. She was, he was wont to declare in moments of enthusiasm, a woman in a thousand. That she was arrayed against us, on the side of our bitterest enemies, never seemed to weigh in his judgment. ""Ah, do not pass on!"" said the countess.

You are stupid now, when you persist in disregarding the warning we sent you. It is the second warning I bring you. Leave England at once. You can do no good here--I tell you that frankly. You will never accomplish anything."" ""In that case,"" I said stiffly, ""it seems rather extraordinary that you are all so anxious to get me out of the country."" The countess shrugged her shoulders--magnificent shoulders, and a magnificent gesture. ""For my part, I think that, too, stupid. I would leave you here to play about happily. But the chiefs, you see, are fearful that some word of yours may give great help to those more intelligent than yourself. Hence--you are to be banished."" The countess appeared to have a flattering idea of my abilities. I concealed my annoyance. Doubtless this attitude of hers was assumed expressly to annoy me and to give me the idea that I was unimportant. ""It would, of course, be quite easy to--remove you,"" she continued, ""but I am quite sentimental sometimes. I pleaded for you. You have a nice little wife somewhere, have you not? And it would please the poor little man who is dead to know that you were not to be killed. I always liked him, you know. He was clever--but clever! Had it not been a case of four against one I honestly believe he might have been too much for us. I confess it frankly--he was my master! I sent a wreath to the funeral as a token of my admiration--an enormous one of crimson roses. Crimson roses express my temperament."" I listened in silence and a growing distaste. ""You have the look of a mule when it puts its ears back and kicks. Well, I have delivered my warning. Remember this, the third warning will come by the hand of the Destroyer--"" She made a sign, and the car whirled away rapidly. I noted the number mechanically, but without the hope that it would lead to anything. The Big Four were not apt to be careless in details. I went home a little sobered. One fact had emerged from the countess's flood of volubility. I was in real danger of my life. Though I had no intention of abandoning the struggle, I saw that it behoved me to walk warily and adopt every possible precaution.","['And', 'try', 'arrested', 'either', 'would', 'stupid', 'You', 'always', 'little', 'stupid', '--', 'yes', 'yes', 'You', 'stupid', 'persist', 'disregarding', 'warning', 'sent', 'It', 'second', 'warning', 'I', 'bring', 'Leave', 'England', 'You', 'good', '--', 'I', 'tell', 'frankly', 'You', 'never', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'In', 'case', 'I', 'said', 'stiffly', 'seems', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'anxious', 'get', 'country', 'The', 'countess', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', '--', 'magnificent', 'shoulders', 'magnificent', 'gesture', 'For', 'part', 'I', 'think', 'stupid', 'I', 'would', 'leave', 'play', 'happily', 'But', 'chiefs', 'see', 'fearful', 'word', 'may', 'give', 'great', 'help', 'intelligent', 'Hence', '--', 'banished', 'The', 'countess', 'appeared', 'flattering', 'idea', 'abilities', 'I', 'concealed', 'annoyance', 'Doubtless', 'attitude', 'assumed', 'expressly', 'annoy', 'give', 'idea', 'I', 'unimportant', 'It', 'would', 'course', 'quite', 'easy', '--', 'remove', 'continued', 'I', 'quite', 'sentimental', 'sometimes', 'I', 'pleaded', 'You', 'nice', 'little', 'wife', 'somewhere', 'And', 'would', 'please', 'poor', 'little', 'man', 'dead', 'know', 'killed', 'I', 'always', 'liked', 'know', 'He', 'clever', '--', 'clever', 'Had', 'case', 'four', 'one', 'I', 'honestly', 'believe', 'might', 'much', 'us', 'I', 'confess', 'frankly', '--', 'master', 'I', 'sent', 'wreath', 'funeral', 'token', 'admiration', '--', 'enormous', 'one', 'crimson', 'roses', 'Crimson', 'roses', 'express', 'temperament', 'I', 'listened', 'silence', 'growing', 'distaste', 'You', 'look', 'mule', 'puts', 'ears', 'back', 'kicks', 'Well', 'I', 'delivered', 'warning', 'Remember', 'third', 'warning', 'come', 'hand', 'Destroyer--', 'She', 'made', 'sign', 'car', 'whirled', 'away', 'rapidly', 'I', 'noted', 'number', 'mechanically', 'without', 'hope', 'would', 'lead', 'anything', 'The', 'Big', 'Four', 'apt', 'careless', 'details', 'I', 'went', 'home', 'little', 'sobered', 'One', 'fact', 'emerged', 'countess', ""'s"", 'flood', 'volubility', 'I', 'real', 'danger', 'life', 'Though', 'I', 'intention', 'abandoning', 'struggle', 'I', 'saw', 'behoved', 'walk', 'warily', 'adopt', 'every', 'possible', 'precaution']"

""Yes. Hallo. Who's speaking?"" A crisp voice answered me. ""This is St. Giles' Hospital. We have a Chinaman here, knifed in the street and brought in. He can't last long. We rang you up because we found in his pocket a piece of paper with your name and address on it."" I was very much astonished. Nevertheless, after a moment's reflection I said that I would come down at once. St. Giles' Hospital was, I knew, down by the docks, and it occurred to me that the Chinaman might have just come off some ship. It was on my way down there that a sudden suspicion shot into my mind. Was the whole thing a trap? Wherever a Chinaman was, there might be the hand of Li Chang Yen. I remembered the adventure of the Baited Trap. Was the whole thing a ruse on the part of my enemies? A little reflection convinced me that at any rate a visit to the hospital would do no harm. It was probable that the thing was not so much a plot as what is vulgarly known as a ""plant."" The dying Chinaman would make some revelation to me upon which I should act, and which would have the result of leading me into the hands of the Big Four. The thing to do was to preserve an open mind, and whilst feigning credulity be secretly on my guard. On arriving at St. Giles' Hospital, and making my business known, I was taken at once to the accident ward, to the bedside of the man in question. He lay absolutely still, his eyelids closed, and only a very faint movement of the chest showed that he still breathed. A doctor stood by the bed, his fingers on the Chinaman's pulse. ""He's almost gone,"" he whispered to me. ""You know him, eh?"" I shook my head. ""I've never seen him before."" ""Then what was he doing with your name and address in his pocket? You are Captain Hastings, aren't you?"" ""Yes, but I can't explain it any more than you can."" ""Curious thing. From his papers he seems to have been the servant of a man called Ingles--a retired Civil Servant. Ah, you know him, do you?"" he added quickly, as I started at the name. Ingles's servant!

He must have been with Ingles on his way to China, and after the catastrophe he had returned to England with a message, possibly, for me. It was vital, imperative that I should hear that message. ""Is he conscious?"" I asked. ""Can he speak? Mr. Ingles was an old friend of mine, and I think it possible that this poor fellow has brought me a message from him. Mr. Ingles is believed to have gone overboard about ten days ago."" ""He's just conscious, but I doubt if he has the force to speak. He lost a terrible lot of blood, you know. I can administer a stimulant, of course, but we've already done all that is possible in that direction."" Nevertheless, he administered a hypodermic injection, and I stayed by the bed, hoping against hope for a word--a sign--that might be of the utmost value to me in my work. But the minutes sped on and no sign came. And suddenly a baleful idea shot across my mind? Was I not already falling into the trap? Suppose that this Chinaman had merely assumed the part of Ingles's servant, that he was in reality an agent of the Big Four? Had I not once read that certain Chinese priests were capable of simulating death? Or, to go further still, Li Chang Yen might command a little band of fanatics who would welcome death itself if it came at the command of their master. I must be on my guard. Even as these thoughts flashed across my mind, the man in the bed stirred. His eyes opened. He murmured something incoherently. Then I saw his glance fasten upon me. He made no sign of recognition, but I was at once aware that he was trying to speak to me. Be he friend or foe, I must hear what he had to say. I leaned over the bed, but the broken sounds conveyed no sort of meaning to me. I thought I caught the word ""hand,"" but in what connection it was used I could not tell. Then it came again, and this time I heard another word, the word ""Largo."" I stared in amazement, as the possible juxtaposition of the two suggested itself to me. ""Handel's Largo?"" I queried. The Chinaman's eyelids flickered rapidly, as though in assent, and he added another Italian word, the word ""_carrozza_.""

I went out into the air again thoroughly bewildered. ""Handel's Largo,"" and a ""_carrozza_."" If I remembered rightly, a _carrozza_ was a carriage. What possible meaning could lie behind those simple words. The man was a Chinaman, not an Italian, why should he speak in Italian? Surely, if he were indeed Ingles's servant, he must know English? The whole thing was profoundly mystifying. I puzzled over it all the way home. Oh, if only Poirot had been there to solve the problem with his lightning ingenuity! I let myself in with my latch-key and went slowly up to my room. A letter was lying on the table, and I tore it open carelessly enough. But in a minute I stood rooted to the ground whilst I read. It was a communication from a firm of solicitors. ""DEAR SIR (it ran),--As instructed by our late client, M. Hercule Poirot, we forward you the enclosed letter. This letter was placed in our hands a week before his death, with instructions that in the event of his demise, it should be sent to you at a certain date after his death. ""Yours faithfully, etc."" I turned the enclosed missive over and over. It was undoubtedly from Poirot. I knew that familiar writing only too well. With a heavy heart, yet a certain eagerness, I tore it open. ""MON CHER AMI (it began),--When you receive this I shall be no more. Do not shed tears about me, but follow my orders. Immediately upon receipt of this, return to South America. Do not be pig-headed about this. It is not for sentimental reasons that I bid you undertake the journey. _It is necessary._ It is part of the plan of Hercule Poirot! To say more is unnecessary, to any one who has the acute intelligence of my friend Hastings. ""_A bas_ the Big Four! I salute you, my friend, from beyond the grave. ""Ever thine, ""HERCULE POIROT."" I read and re-read this astonishing communication. One thing was evident. This amazing man had so provided for every eventuality that even his own death did not upset the sequence of his plans!

There was now nothing to hinder my immediate departure. I sent off cables, booked my passage, and one week later found me embarking in the _Ansonia_ en route for Buenos Ayres. Just as the boat left the quay, a steward brought me a note. It had been given him, so he explained, by a big gentleman in a fur coat who had left the boat last thing before the gangway planks were lifted. I opened it. It was terse and to the point. ""You are wise,"" it ran. It was signed with a big figure 4. I could afford to smile to myself! The sea was not too choppy. I enjoyed a passable dinner, made up my mind as to the majority of my fellow passengers, and had a rubber or two of Bridge. Then I turned in and slept like a log as I always do on board ship. I was awakened by feeling myself persistently shaken. Dazed and bewildered, I saw that one of the ship's officers was standing over me. He gave a sigh of relief as I sat up. ""Thank the Lord I've got you awake at last. I've had no end of a job. Do you always sleep like that?"" ""What's the matter?"" I asked, still bewildered and not fully awake. ""Is there anything wrong with the ship?"" ""I expect you know what's the matter better than I do,"" he replied dryly. ""Special instructions from the Admiralty. There's a destroyer waiting to take you off."" ""What?"" I cried. ""In mid-ocean?"" ""It seems a most mysterious affair, but that's not my business. They've sent a young fellow aboard who is to take your place, and we are all sworn to secrecy. Will you get up and dress?"" Utterly unable to conceal my amazement I did as I was told. A boat was lowered, and I was conveyed aboard the destroyer. There I was received courteously, but got no further information. The commander's instructions were to land me at a certain spot on the Belgian coast. There his knowledge and responsibility ended. The whole thing was like a dream. The one idea I held to firmly was that all this must be part of Poirot's plan. I must simply go forward blindly, trusting in my dead friend. I was duly landed at the spot indicated.

The country became wooded and hilly. I realised that we were penetrating into the Ardennes, and I suddenly remembered Poirot's saying that he had a brother who lived at Spa. But we did not go to Spa itself. We left the main road and wound into the leafy fastnesses of the hills, till we reached a little hamlet, and an isolated white villa high on the hill-side. Here the car stopped in front of the green door of the villa. The door opened as I alighted. An elderly man-servant stood in the doorway bowing. ""M. le Capitaine Hastings?"" he said in French. ""Monsieur le Capitaine is expected. If he will follow me."" He led the way across the hall, and flung open a door at the back, standing aside to let me pass in. I blinked a little, for the room faced west and the afternoon sun was pouring in. Then my vision cleared and I saw a figure waiting to welcome me with outstretched hands. It was--oh, impossible, it couldn't be--but yes! ""Poirot!"" I cried, and for once did not attempt to evade the embrace with which he overwhelmed me. ""But yes, but yes, it is indeed I! Not so easy to kill Hercule Poirot!"" ""But Poirot--_why_?"" ""A _ruse de guerre_, my friend, a _ruse de guerre_. All is now ready for our grand coup."" ""But you might have told _me_!"" ""No, Hastings, I could not. Never, never, in a thousand years, could you have acted the part at the funeral. As it was, it was perfect. It could not fail to carry conviction to the Big Four."" ""But what I've been through--"" ""Do not think me too unfeeling. I carried out the deception partly for your sake. I was willing to risk my own life, but I had qualms about continually risking yours. So, after the explosion, I have an idea of great brilliancy. The good Ridgeway, he enables me to carry it out.

1,The Big Four,12,17. NUMBER FOUR WINS A TRICK,1,"From our quiet retreat in the Ardennes we watched the progress of affairs in the great world. We were plentifully supplied with newspapers, and every day Poirot received a bulky envelope, evidently containing some kind of report. He never showed these reports to me, but I could usually tell from his manner whether its contents had been satisfactory or otherwise. He never wavered in his belief that our present plan was the only one likely to be crowned by success. ""As a minor point, Hastings,"" he remarked one day, ""I was in continual fear of your death lying at my door. And that rendered me nervous--like a cat upon the jumps, as you say. But now I am well satisfied. Even if they discover that the Captain Hastings who landed in South America is an imposter (and I do not think they will discover it, they are not likely to send an agent out there who knows you personally), they will only believe that you are trying to circumvent them in some clever manner of your own, and will pay no serious attention to discovering your whereabouts. Of the one vital fact, my supposed death, they are thoroughly convinced. They will go ahead and mature their plans."" ""And then?"" I asked eagerly. ""And then, _mon ami_, grand resurrection of Hercule Poirot! At the eleventh hour I reappear, throw all into confusion, and achieve the supreme victory in my own unique manner!"" I realised that Poirot's vanity was of the case-hardened variety which could withstand all attacks. I reminded him that once or twice the honours of the game had lain with our adversaries.

""I don't see--"" ""My dear friend, you _never_ see--and anyway the English know no geography."" ""Geography?"" I cried. ""What has geography got to do with it?"" ""I dare say M. Thomas Cook would be more to the point."" As usual, Poirot refused to say anything more--a most irritating trick of his. But I noticed that his manner became extremely cheerful, as though he had scored some point or other. The days went on, pleasant if a trifle monotonous. There were plenty of books in the villa, and delightful rambles all around, but I chafed sometimes at the forced inactivity of our life, and marvelled at Poirot's state of placid content. Nothing occurred to ruffle our quiet existence, and it was not until the end of June, well within the limit that Poirot had given them, that we had our news of the Big Four. A car drove up to the villa early one morning, such an unusual event in our peaceful life that I hurried down to satisfy my curiosity. I found Poirot talking to a pleasant-faced young fellow of about my own age. He introduced me. ""This is Captain Harvey, Hastings, one of the most famous members of your Intelligence Service."" ""Not famous at all, I'm afraid,"" said the young man, laughing pleasantly. ""Not famous except to those in the know, I should have said. Most of Captain Harvey's friends and acquaintances consider him an amiable but brainless young man--devoted only to the trot of the fox or whatever the dance is called."" We both laughed. ""Well, well, to business,"" said Poirot. ""You are of opinion the time has come, then?"" ""We are sure of it, sir. China was isolated politically yesterday. What is going on out there, nobody knows.

I believed him, but it was not likely that I should consent to being left behind in that fashion. Our argument was short but decisive. It was not until we were in the train, speeding towards Paris that he admitted that he was secretly glad of my decision. ""For you have a part to play, Hastings. An important part!

During Harvey's absence from our carriage I took the opportunity of asking Poirot why he had said that the discovery of the rendezvous was my work. ""Because it was, my friend. How Ingles managed to get hold of the information I do not know, but he did, and he sent it to us by his servant. We are bound, _mon ami_ for Karersee, the new Italian name for which is Lago di Carezza. You see now where your 'Cara Zia' comes in and also your 'Carrozza' and 'Largo'--the Handel was supplied by your own imagination. Possibly some reference to the information coming from the 'hand' of M. Ingles started the train of association."" ""Karersee?"" I queried. ""I never heard of it."" ""I always tell you that the English know no geography. But as a matter of fact it is a well-known and very beautiful summer resort, four thousand feet up, in the heart of the Dolomites."" ""And it is in this out of the way spot that the Big Four have their rendezvous?"" ""Say rather their headquarters. The signal has been given and it is their intention to disappear from the world and issue orders from their mountain fastness. I have made the inquiries--a lot of quarrying of stone and mineral deposits is done there, and the company, apparently a small Italian firm, is in reality controlled by Abe Ryland. I am prepared to swear that a vast subterranean dwelling has been hollowed out in the very heart of the mountain, secret and inaccessible. From there the leaders of the organisation will issue by wireless their orders to their followers who are numbered by thousands in every country.

This will be Russia on an infinitely larger scale--and with this additional menace--that Madame Olivier's experiments have proceeded further than she has ever given out. I believe that she has, to a certain extent, succeeded in liberating atomic energy and harnessing it to her purpose. Her experiments with the nitrogen of the air have been very remarkable, and she has also experimented in the concentration of wireless energy, so that a beam of great intensity can be focused upon some given spot. Exactly how far she has progressed, nobody knows, but it is certain that it is much farther than has ever been given out. She is a genius, that woman--the Curies were as nothing to her. Add to her genius the powers of Ryland's almost unlimited wealth, and, with the brain of Li Chang Yen, the finest criminal brain ever known, to direct and plan--_eh bien_, it will not be, as you say, all jam for civilisation."" His words made me very thoughtful. Although Poirot was given at times to exaggeration of language, he was not really an alarmist. For the first time I realised what a desperate struggle it was upon which we were engaged. Harvey soon rejoined us and the journey went on. We arrived at Bolzano about midday. From there the journey on was by motor. Several big blue motor-cars were waiting in the central square of the town, and we three got into one of them. Poirot, notwithstanding the heat of the day, was muffled to the eyes in greatcoat and scarf. His eyes and the tips of his ears were all that could be seen of him.

Then we emerged into a fertile valley, which continued for some miles, and then, still winding steadily upwards, the bare rocky peaks began to show with dense clustering pine woods at their base. The whole place was wild and lovely. Finally a series of abrupt curves, with the road running through the pine woods on either side, and we came suddenly upon a big hotel and found that we had arrived. Our rooms had been reserved for us, and under Harvey's guidance we went straight up to them. They looked straight out over the rocky peaks and the long slopes of pine woods leading up to them. Poirot made a gesture towards them. ""It is there?"" he asked in a low voice. ""Yes,"" replied Harvey. ""There is a place called the Felsenlabyrynth--all big boulders piled about in a most fantastic way--a path winds through them. The quarrying is to the right of that, but we think that the entrance is probably in the Felsenlabyrynth."" Poirot nodded. ""Come, _mon ami_,"" he said to me. ""Let us go down and sit upon the terrace and enjoy the sunlight."" ""You think that wise?"" I asked. He shrugged his shoulders. The sunlight was marvellous--in fact the glare was almost too great for me. We had some creamy coffee instead of tea, then went upstairs and unpacked our few belongings. Poirot was in his most unapproachable mood, lost in a kind of reverie. Once or twice he shook his head and sighed.

More so, indeed, for in addition to greatcoat and muffler, he was wearing huge blue spectacles. I was convinced that here we had an emissary of the Big Four. Poirot did not seem very impressed by my idea, but when, leaning out of my bedroom window, I reported that the man in question was strolling about in the vicinity of the hotel, he admitted that there might be something in it. I urged my friend not to go down to dinner, but he insisted on doing so. We entered the dining-room rather late, and were shown to a table by the window. As we sat down, our attention was attracted by an exclamation and a crash of falling china. A dish of _haricots verts_ had been upset over a man who was sitting at the table next to ours. The head waiter came up and was vociferous in apologies. Presently, when the offending waiter was serving us with soup, Poirot spoke to him. ""An unfortunate accident, that. But it was not your fault."" ""Monsieur saw that? No, indeed it was not my fault. The gentleman half sprung up from his chair--I thought he was going to have an attack of some kind. I could not save the catastrophe."" I saw Poirot's eyes shining with the green light I knew so well, and as the waiter departed he said to me in a low voice:-- ""You see, Hastings, the effect of Hercule Poirot--alive and in the flesh?"" ""You think--"" I had not time to continue. I felt Poirot's hand on my knee, as he whispered excitedly: ""Look, Hastings, look. _His trick with the bread!_ Number Four!""

His face, clean-shaven and puffily fat, was of a pasty, unhealthy sallowness, with heavy pouches under the eyes and deep lines running from his nose to the corners of his mouth. His age might have been anything from thirty-five to forty-five. In no particular did he resemble any one of the characters which Number Four had previously assumed. Indeed, had it not been for his little trick with the bread, of which he was evidently quite unaware, I would have sworn readily enough that the man sitting there was some one whom I had never seen before. ""He has recognised you,"" I murmured. ""You should not have come down."" ""My excellent Hastings, I have feigned death for three months for this one purpose."" ""To startle Number Four?"" ""To startle him at a moment when he must act quickly or not at all. And we have this great advantage--he does not know that we recognise him. He thinks that he is safe in his new disguise.

I went out on to the terrace, a little disturbed in mind. Poirot's assurance did not quite content me. However, so long as we were on our guard, nothing could happen to us. I resolved to keep thoroughly on the alert. It was quite five minutes before Poirot joined me. With his usual precautions against cold, he was muffled up to the ears. He sat down beside me and sipped his coffee appreciatively. ""Only in England is the coffee so atrocious,"" he remarked. ""On the continent they understand how important it is for the digestion that it should be properly made."" As he finished speaking, the man from the next table suddenly appeared on the terrace. Without any hesitation, he came over and drew up a third chair to our table. ""You do not mind my joining you, I hope,"" he said in English. ""Not at all, monsieur,"" said Poirot. I felt very uneasy. It is true that we were on the terrace of the hotel, with people all round us, but nevertheless I was not satisfied. I sensed the presence of danger. Meanwhile Number Four chatted away in a perfectly natural manner. It seemed impossible to believe that he was anything but a _bona fide_ tourist. He described excursions and motor trips, and posed as quite an authority on the neighbourhood. He took a pipe from his pocket and began to light it. Poirot drew out his case of tiny cigarettes.

They had me under each arm, supporting my weight, and there was a gag in my mouth. It was pitch dark, but I gathered that we were not outside, but passing through the hotel. All round I could hear people shouting and demanding in every known language what had happened to the lights. My captors swung me down some stairs. We passed along a basement passage, then through a door and out into the open again through a glass door at the back of the hotel. In another moment we had gained the shelter of the pine trees. I had caught a glimpse of another figure in a similar plight to myself, and realised that Poirot, too, was a victim of this bold coup. By sheer audacity, Number Four had won the day. He had employed, I gathered, an instant æsthetic, probably ethyl chloride--breaking a small bulb of it under our noses. Then, in the confusion of the darkness, his accomplices, who had probably been guests sitting at the next table, had thrust gags in our mouths and hurried us away, taking us through the hotel to baffle pursuit.

At last we emerged in the open, on the mountain-side, and I saw just in front of us an extraordinary conglomeration of fantastic rocks and boulders. This must be the Felsenlabyrynth of which Harvey had spoken. Soon we were winding in and out of its recesses. The place was like a maze devised by some evil genie. Suddenly we stopped. An enormous rock barred our path. One of the men stooped and seemed to push on something when, without a sound, the huge mass of rock turned on itself and disclosed a small tunnel-like opening leading into the mountain-side. Into this we were hurried. For some time the tunnel was narrow, but presently it widened, and before very long we came out into a wide rocky chamber lighted by electricity. There the gags were removed. At a sign from Number Four, who stood facing us with mocking triumph in his face, we were searched and every article was removed from our pockets, including Poirot's little automatic pistol. A pang smote me as it was tossed down on the table. We were defeated--hopelessly defeated and outnumbered. It was the end. ""Welcome to the headquarters of the Big Four, M.

""Your arrival will be somewhat of a surprise to my colleagues."" He indicated a narrow doorway in the wall. We passed through and found ourselves in another chamber. At the very end of it was a table behind which four chairs were placed. The end chair was empty, but was draped with a mandarin's cape. On the second, smoking a cigar, sat Mr. Abe Ryland. Leaning back in the third chair, with her burning eyes and her nun's face, was Madame Olivier. Number Four took his seat on the fourth chair. We were in the presence of the Big Four. Never before had I felt so fully the reality and the presence of Li Chang Yen as I did now when confronting his empty seat. Far away in China, he yet controlled and directed this malign organisation. Madame Olivier gave a faint cry on seeing us. Ryland, more self-controlled, only shifted his cigar, and raised his grizzled eyebrows. ""M. Hercule Poirot,"" said Ryland slowly. ""This is a pleasant surprise. You put it over on us all right. We thought you were good and buried. No matter, the game is up now."" There was a ring as of steel in his voice.

Something unexpected, something I had not been prepared to hear in his voice made me look at him. He seemed quite composed. Yet there was something about his whole appearance that was different. Then there was a stir of draperies behind us, and the Countess Vera Rossakoff came in. ""Ah!"" said Number Four. ""Our valued and trusted lieutenant. An old friend of yours is here, my dear lady."" The countess whirled round with her usual vehemence of movement. ""God in Heaven!"" she cried. ""It is the little man! Ah! but he has the nine lives of a cat! Oh, little man, little man! Why did you mix yourself up in this?"" ""Madame,"" said Poirot, with a bow. ""Me, like the great Napoleon, I am on the side of the big battalions."" As he spoke I saw a sudden suspicion flash into her eyes, and at the same moment I knew the truth which subconsciously I already sensed. The man beside me was not Hercule Poirot. He was very like him, extraordinarily like him. There was the same egg-shaped head, the same strutting figure, delicately plump.

That man is not Hercule Poirot!"" Number Four uttered an incredulous exclamation, but the countess leant forward and snatched at Poirot's moustaches. They came off in her hand, and then, indeed, the truth was plain. For this man's upper lip was disfigured by a small scar which completely altered the expression of the face. ""Not Hercule Poirot,"" muttered Number Four. ""But who can he be then?"" ""I know,"" I cried suddenly, and then stopped dead, afraid I had ruined everything. But the man I will still refer to as Poirot had turned to me encouragingly. ""Say it if you will. It makes no matter now. The trick has succeeded."" ""This is Achille Poirot,"" I said slowly. ""Hercule Poirot's twin brother."" ""Impossible,"" said Ryland sharply, but he was shaken. ""Hercule's plan has succeeded to a marvel,"" said Achille placidly.

It struck me just then that although perfectly willing to lay down my life I might have been consulted in the matter. Then I remembered how Poirot had urged me to stay behind, and I felt appeased. ""And in what way will your laying down your life benefit the world?"" asked Ryland sardonically. ""I see that you do not perceive the true inwardness of Hercule's plan.

Then you can see for yourself the truth of my words. Already they should have traced me to the entrance in the Felsenlabyrynth."" Even as he spoke, there was a far off reverberation, and a man ran in shouting incoherently. Ryland sprang up and went out. Madame Olivier moved to the end of the room and opened a door that I had not noticed. Inside I caught a glimpse of a perfectly equipped laboratory which reminded me of the one in Paris. Number Four also sprang up and went out. He returned with Poirot's revolver which he gave to the countess. ""There is no danger of their escaping,"" he said grimly. ""But still you had better have this."" Then he went out again. The countess came over to us and surveyed my companion attentively for some time. Suddenly she laughed. ""You are very clever, M.

The countess suddenly dropped her jesting manner. She spoke with passionate bitterness. ""Fool! My heart's desire! Can you give me revenge upon my enemies?

From the outer room she led us into the tunnel by which we had first entered, but a short way along this forked, and she turned off to the right. Again and again the passage divided, but she led us on, never faltering or seeming to doubt her way, and with increasing speed. ""If only we are in time,"" she panted. ""We must be out in the open before the explosion occurs."" Still we went on. I understood that this tunnel led right through the mountain and that we should finally emerge on the other side, facing a different valley. The sweat streamed down my face, but I raced on. And then, far away, I saw a gleam of daylight. Nearer and nearer. I saw green bushes growing. We forced them aside, pushed our way through. We were in the open again, with the faint light of dawn making everything rosy. Poirot's cordon was a reality.

His keen mind had long since accepted the fact that divorce was the only possible way out. Ruth had agreed to the proposed solution with more readiness than he had hoped for.

""I have got a job for you."" ""Yes, Mr. Van Aldin?"" ""My daughter is married to the Hon. Derek Kettering, as you may perhaps know."" Mr. Goby transferred his gaze from the radiator to the left-hand drawer of the desk, and permitted a deprecating smile to pass over his face.

""Ask Mr. Kettering to come up, please."" The secretary gathered up his papers and departed.

As he was walking along Curzon Street, a figure came out of No. 160, and turned up the street towards him, so that they passed each other on the pavement. For a moment, the millionaire had fancied it might be Derek Kettering himself; the height and build were not unlike. But as they came face to face, he saw that the man was a stranger to him. At least--no, not a stranger; his face awoke some call of recognition in the millionaire's mind, and it was associated definitely with something unpleasant. He cudgelled his brains in vain, but the thing eluded him. He went on, shaking his head irritably. He hated to be baffled. Ruth Kettering was clearly expecting him. She ran to him and kissed him when he entered. ""Well, Dad, how are things going?"" ""Very well,"" said Van Aldin; ""but I have got a word or two to say to you, Ruth."" Almost insensibly he felt the change in her; something shrewd and watchful replaced the impulsiveness of her greeting. She sat down in a big arm-chair. ""Well, Dad?"" she asked. ""What is it?"" ""I saw your husband this morning,"" said Van Aldin. ""You saw Derek?"" ""I did. He said a lot of things, most of which were darned cheek. Just as he was leaving, he said something that I didn't understand. He advised me to be sure that there was perfect frankness between father and daughter. What did he mean by that, Ruthie?""

For all his nonchalance, his interview with his father-in-law had shaken him more than he cared to show. He had a solitary lunch, and after it, frowning to himself a little, he went around to the sumptuous flat that housed the lady known as Mirelle. A trim Frenchwoman received him with smiles. ""But enter then, Monsieur. Madame reposes herself."" He was ushered into the long room with its Eastern setting which he knew so well.

No one knows how these things come about. Snake-charmers, they say, are born, not made. Katherine Grey was born with the power of managing old ladies, dogs, and small boys, and she did it without any apparent sense of strain. At twenty-three she had been a quiet girl with beautiful eyes. At thirty-three she was a quiet woman, with those same grey eyes, shining steadily out on the world with a kind of happy serenity that nothing could shake. Moreover, she had been born with, and still possessed, a sense of humour. As she sat at the breakfast-table, staring in front of her, there was a ring at the bell, accompanied by a very energetic rat-a-tat-tat at the knocker. In another minute the little maid-servant opened the door and announced rather breathlessly: ""Dr. Harrison.""

""It must be quite a novel experience for you,"" she said drily. Katherine went to say good-bye to old Miss Viner before leaving the village. Miss Viner was two years older than Mrs. Harfield, and her mind was mainly taken with her own success in outliving her dead friend.

She laid down the continental _Daily Mail_ and stared out across the blue waters of the Mediterranean. A branch of golden mimosa, hanging just above her head, made an effective frame for a very charming picture. A golden-haired, blue-eyed lady in a very becoming negligee. That the golden hair owed something to art, as did the pink-and-white complexion, was undeniable, but the blue of the eyes was Nature's gift, and at forty-four Lady Tamplin could still rank as a beauty. Charming as she looked, Lady Tamplin was, for once, not thinking of herself. That is to say, she was not thinking of her appearance. She was intent on graver matters. Lady Tamplin was a well-known figure on the Riviera, and her parties at the Villa Marguerite were justly celebrated. She was a woman of considerable experience, and had had four husbands. The first had been merely an indiscretion, and so was seldom referred to by the lady. He had had the good sense to die with commendable promptitude, and his widow thereupon espoused a rich manufacturer of buttons. He too had departed for another sphere after three years of married life--it was said after a congenial evening with some boon companions.

This fourth venture had been undertaken for pure pleasure. Mr. Charles Evans, an extremely good-looking young man of twenty-seven, with delightful manners, a keen love of sport, and an appreciation of this world's goods, had no money of his own whatsoever. Lady Tamplin was very pleased and satisfied with life generally, but she had occasional faint preoccupations about money. The button manufacturer had left his widow a considerable fortune, but, as Lady Tamplin was wont to say, ""what with one thing and another--"" (one thing being the depreciation of stocks owing to the War, and the other the extravagances of the late Lord Tamplin). She was still comfortably off. But to be merely comfortably off is hardly satisfactory to one of Rosalie Tamplin's temperament.

""I have put your dressing-case under your seat, Madam, in case you should need it. Shall I take the rugs, or will you require one?"" ""No, no, I shan't want one. Better go and find your own seat now, Mason."" ""Yes, Madam."" The maid departed. Van Aldin entered the Pullman car with Ruth. She found her seat, and Van Aldin deposited various papers and magazines on the table in front of her. The seat opposite to her was already taken, and the American gave a cursory glance at its occupant. He had a fleeting impression of attractive grey eyes and a neat travelling costume. He indulged in a little more desultory conversation with Ruth, the kind of talk peculiar to those seeing other people off by train. Presently, as whistles blew, he glanced at his watch. ""I had best be clearing out of here. Good-bye, my dear. Don't worry, I will attend to things."" ""Oh, father!"" He turned back sharply. There had been something in Ruth's voice, something so entirely foreign to her usual manner, that he was startled. It was almost a cry of despair. She had made an impulsive movement towards him, but in another minute she was mistress of herself once more. ""Till next month,"" she said cheerfully. Two minutes later the train started. Ruth sat very still, biting her under lip and trying hard to keep the unaccustomed tears from her eyes. She felt a sudden sense of horrible desolation. There was a wild longing upon her to jump out of the train and to go back before it was too late. She, so calm, so self-assured, for the first time in her life felt like a leaf swept by the wind. If her father knew--what would he say? Madness! Yes, just that, madness! For the first time in her life she was swept away by emotion, swept away to the point of doing a thing which even she knew to be incredibly foolish","['black', 'standing', '--', 'Ruth', 'Kettering', ""'s"", 'maid', 'She', 'drew', 'aside', 'mistress', 'came', 'I', 'put', 'dressing', 'case', 'seat', 'Madam', 'case', 'need', 'Shall', 'I', 'take', 'rugs', 'require', 'one', 'No', 'I', 'sha', ""n't"", 'want', 'one', 'Better', 'go', 'find', 'seat', 'Mason', 'Yes', 'Madam', 'The', 'maid', 'departed', 'Van', 'Aldin', 'entered', 'Pullman', 'car', 'Ruth', 'She', 'found', 'seat', 'Van', 'Aldin', 'deposited', 'various', 'papers', 'magazines', 'table', 'front', 'The', 'seat', 'opposite', 'already', 'taken', 'American', 'gave', 'cursory', 'glance', 'occupant', 'He', 'fleeting', 'impression', 'attractive', 'grey', 'eyes', 'neat', 'travelling', 'costume', 'He', 'indulged', 'little', 'desultory', 'conversation', 'Ruth', 'kind', 'talk', 'peculiar', 'seeing', 'people', 'train', 'Presently', 'whistles', 'blew', 'glanced', 'watch', 'I', 'best', 'clearing', 'Good', 'bye', 'dear', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'I', 'attend', 'things', 'Oh', 'father', 'He', 'turned', 'back', 'sharply', 'There', 'something', 'Ruth', ""'s"", 'voice', 'something', 'entirely', 'foreign', 'usual', 'manner', 'startled', 'It', 'almost', 'cry', 'despair', 'She', 'made', 'impulsive', 'movement', 'towards', 'another', 'minute', 'mistress', 'Till', 'next', 'month', 'said', 'cheerfully', 'Two', 'minutes', 'later', 'train', 'started', 'Ruth', 'sat', 'still', 'biting', 'lip', 'trying', 'hard', 'keep', 'unaccustomed', 'tears', 'eyes', 'She', 'felt', 'sudden', 'sense', 'horrible', 'desolation', 'There', 'wild', 'longing', 'upon', 'jump', 'train', 'go', 'back', 'late', 'She', 'calm', 'self', 'assured', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'felt', 'like', 'leaf', 'swept', 'wind', 'If', 'father', 'knew', '--', 'would', 'say', 'Madness', 'Yes', 'madness', 'For', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'swept', 'away', 'emotion', 'swept', 'away', 'point', 'thing', 'even', 'knew', 'incredibly', 'foolish']"

But she was his daughter in another sense also. She had that same iron determination that would have what it wanted, and once it had made up its mind would not be balked. From her cradle she had been self-willed; the very circumstances of her life had developed that self-will in her. It drove her now remorselessly. Well, the die was cast. She must go through with it now. She looked up, and her eyes met those of the woman sitting opposite. She had a sudden fancy that in some way this other woman had read her mind. She saw in those grey eyes understanding and--yes--compassion. It was only a fleeting impression. The faces of both women hardened to well-bred impassiveness. Mrs. Kettering took up a magazine, and Katherine Grey looked out of the window and watched a seemingly endless vista of depressing streets and suburban houses. Ruth found an increasing difficulty in fixing her mind on the printed page in front of her. In spite of herself, a thousand apprehensions preyed on her mind. What a fool she had been! What a fool she was! Like all cool and self-sufficient people, when she did lose her self-control she lost it thoroughly. It was too late.... Was it too late? Oh, for some one to speak to, for some one to advise her. She had never before had such a wish; she would have scorned the idea of relying on any judgment other than her own, but now--what was the matter with her? Panic. Yes, that would describe it best--panic. She, Ruth Kettering, was completely and utterly panic stricken. She stole a covert glance at the figure opposite. If only she knew some one like that, some nice, cool, calm, sympathetic creature. That was the sort of person one could talk to. But you can't, of course, confide in a stranger.

What happiness had she ever had in her life up to now? She said to herself restlessly: ""Why shouldn't I be happy? No one will ever know."" It seemed no time before Dover was reached. Ruth was a good sailor. She disliked the cold, and was glad to reach the shelter of the private cabin she had telegraphed for. Although she would not have admitted the fact, Ruth was in some ways superstitious. She was of the order of people to whom coincidence appeals. After disembarking at Calais and settling herself down with her maid in her double compartment in the Blue Train, she went along to the luncheon car. It was with a little shock of surprise that she found herself set down to a small table with, opposite her, the same woman who had been her _vis-à-vis_ in the Pullman. A faint smile came to the lips of both women. ""This is quite a coincidence,"" said Mrs. Kettering. ""I know,"" said Katherine; ""it is odd the way things happen."" A flying attendant shot up to them with the wonderful velocity always displayed by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits and deposited two cups of soup. By the time the omelette succeeded the soup they were chatting together in friendly fashion. ""It will be heavenly to get into the sunshine,"" sighed Ruth. ""I am sure it will be a wonderful feeling."" ""You know the Riviera well?"" ""No; this is my first visit."" ""Fancy that."" ""You go every year, I expect?"" ""Practically. January and February in London are horrible."" ""I have always lived in the country. They are not very inspiring months there either. Mostly mud."" ""What made you suddenly decide to travel?""

Katherine laughed. ""I don't really know. I suppose one forms impressions without thinking of it. I put you down in my own mind as one of the very rich of the earth. It was just an impression. I dare say I am wrong."" ""No,"" said Ruth, ""you are not wrong."" She had suddenly become very grave. ""I wish you would tell me what other impressions you formed about me?"" ""I--"" Ruth swept on disregarding the other's embarrassment. ""Oh, please, don't be conventional. I want to know. As we left Victoria I looked across at you, and I had the sort of feeling that you--well, understood what was going on in my mind."" ""I can assure you I am not a mind reader,"" said Katherine, smiling. ""No; but will you tell me, please, just what you thought."" Ruth's eagerness was so intense and so sincere that she carried her point. ""I will tell you if you like, but you must not think me impertinent. I thought that for some reason you were in great distress of mind, and I was sorry for you."" ""You are right. You are quite right. I am in terrible trouble. I--I should like to tell you something about it, if I may."" ""Oh, dear,"" Katherine thought to herself, ""how extraordinarily alike the world seems to be everywhere! People were always telling me things in St. Mary Mead, and it is just the same thing here, and I don't really want to hear anybody's troubles!"" She replied politely: ""Do tell me."" They were just finishing their lunch. Ruth gulped down her coffee, rose from her seat, and quite oblivious of the fact that Katherine had not begun to sip her coffee, said: ""Come to my compartment with me."" They were two single compartments with a communicating door between them.

It is queer--but I never knew until to-day how terribly fond of him I am."" She sat up and dried her eyes with a handkerchief. ""I have been very foolish. Thank you so much for letting me talk to you. I don't know why I got into such a queer, hysterical state."" She got up. ""I am quite all right now. I suppose, really, I just needed some one to talk to. I can't think now why I have been making such an absolute fool of myself."" Katherine got up too.

She added tactfully: ""I must be going back to my own compartment."" She emerged into the corridor at the same time as the maid was also coming out from the next door. The latter looked towards Katherine, over her shoulder, and an expression of intense surprise showed itself on her face. Katherine turned also, but by that time whoever it was who had aroused the maid's interest had retreated into his or her compartment, and the corridor was empty. Katherine walked down it to regain her own place, which was in the next coach. As she passed the end compartment the door opened and a woman's face looked out for a moment and then pulled the door to sharply. It was a face not easily forgotten, as Katherine was to know when she saw it again. A beautiful face, oval and dark, very heavily made up in a bizarre fashion. Katherine had a feeling that she had seen it before somewhere. She regained her own compartment without other adventure and sat for some time thinking of the confidence which had just been made to her.

""If I have stopped any one from making an idiot of themselves, I suppose I have done good work,"" she thought to herself. ""But who knows? That is the kind of woman who is hard-headed and egotistical all her life, and it might be good for her to do the other sort of thing for a change. Oh, well--I don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She certainly won't want to see _me_ again. That is the worst of letting people tell you things. They never do."" She hoped that she would not be given the same place at dinner. She reflected, not without humour, that it might be awkward for both of them. Leaning back with her head against a cushion she felt tired and vaguely depressed. They had reached Paris, and the slow journey round the _ceinture_, with its interminable stops and waits, was very wearisome. When they arrived at the Gare de Lyon she was glad to get out and walk up and down the platform. The keen cold air was refreshing after the steam-heated train. She observed with a smile that her friend of the mink coat was solving the possible awkwardness of the dinner problem in her own way. A dinner basket was being handed up and received through the window by the maid. When the train started once more, and dinner was announced by a violent ringing of bells, Katherine went along to it much relieved in mind. Her _vis-à-vis_ to-night was of an entirely different kind--a small man, distinctly foreign in appearance, with a rigidly waxed moustache and an egg-shaped head which he carried rather on one side. Katherine had taken in a book to dinner with her. She found the little man's eyes fixed upon it with a kind of twinkling amusement. ""I see, Madame, that you have a _roman policier_.

Katherine felt more and more amused. ""Perhaps they give one the illusion of living an exciting life,"" she suggested. He nodded gravely. ""Yes; there is something in that."" ""Of course, one knows that such things don't really happen,"" Katherine was continuing, but he interrupted her sharply. ""Sometimes, Mademoiselle! Sometimes! I who speak to you--they have happened to _me_."" She threw him a quick, interested glance. ""Some day, who knows, _you_ might be in the thick of things,"" he went on. ""It is all chance."" ""I don't think it is likely,"" said Katherine. ""Nothing of that kind ever happens to me."" He leaned forward. ""Would you like it to?"" The question startled her, and she drew in her breath sharply. ""It is my fancy, perhaps,"" said the little man, as he dexterously polished one of the forks, ""but I think that you have a yearning in you for interesting happenings. _Eh bien_, Mademoiselle, all through my life I have observed one thing--'All one wants one gets!' Who knows?"" His face screwed itself up comically. ""You may get more than you bargain for."" ""Is that a prophecy?"" asked Katherine, smiling as she rose from the table. The little man shook his head. ""I never prophesy,"" he declared pompously. ""It is true that I have the habit of being always right--but I do not boast of it. Good-night, Mademoiselle, and may you sleep well."" Katherine went back along the train amused and entertained by her little neighbour. She passed the open door of her friend's compartment and saw the conductor making up the bed. The lady in the mink coat was standing looking out of the window. The second compartment, as Katherine saw through the communicating door, was empty, with rugs and bags heaped up on the seat. The maid was not there. Katherine found her own bed prepared, and since she was tired, she went to bed and switched","['sale', 'always', 'I', 'told', 'Now', 'eh', 'Mademoiselle', 'I', 'ask', 'student', 'human', 'nature', '--', 'Katherine', 'felt', 'amused', 'Perhaps', 'give', 'one', 'illusion', 'living', 'exciting', 'life', 'suggested', 'He', 'nodded', 'gravely', 'Yes', 'something', 'Of', 'course', 'one', 'knows', 'things', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'Katherine', 'continuing', 'interrupted', 'sharply', 'Sometimes', 'Mademoiselle', 'Sometimes', 'I', 'speak', '--', 'happened', 'She', 'threw', 'quick', 'interested', 'glance', 'Some', 'day', 'knows', 'might', 'thick', 'things', 'went', 'It', 'chance', 'I', ""n't"", 'think', 'likely', 'said', 'Katherine', 'Nothing', 'kind', 'ever', 'happens', 'He', 'leaned', 'forward', 'Would', 'like', 'The', 'question', 'startled', 'drew', 'breath', 'sharply', 'It', 'fancy', 'perhaps', 'said', 'little', 'man', 'dexterously', 'polished', 'one', 'forks', 'I', 'think', 'yearning', 'interesting', 'happenings', 'Eh', 'bien', 'Mademoiselle', 'life', 'I', 'observed', 'one', ""thing--'All"", 'one', 'wants', 'one', 'gets', 'Who', 'knows', 'His', 'face', 'screwed', 'comically', 'You', 'may', 'get', 'bargain', 'Is', 'prophecy', 'asked', 'Katherine', 'smiling', 'rose', 'table', 'The', 'little', 'man', 'shook', 'head', 'I', 'never', 'prophesy', 'declared', 'pompously', 'It', 'true', 'I', 'habit', 'always', 'right', '--', 'I', 'boast', 'Good', 'night', 'Mademoiselle', 'may', 'sleep', 'well', 'Katherine', 'went', 'back', 'along', 'train', 'amused', 'entertained', 'little', 'neighbour', 'She', 'passed', 'open', 'door', 'friend', ""'s"", 'compartment', 'saw', 'conductor', 'making', 'bed', 'The', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'standing', 'looking', 'window', 'The', 'second', 'compartment', 'Katherine', 'saw', 'communicating', 'door', 'empty', 'rugs', 'bags', 'heaped', 'seat', 'The', 'maid', 'Katherine', 'found', 'bed', 'prepared', 'since', 'tired', 'went', 'bed', 'switched']"

Glancing at her watch, she found that it had stopped. A feeling of intense uneasiness pervaded her and grew stronger moment by moment. At last she got up, threw her dressing-gown round her shoulders, and stepped out into the corridor. The whole train seemed wrapped in slumber. Katherine let down the window and sat by it for some minutes, drinking in the cool night air and trying vainly to calm her uneasy fears. She presently decided that she would go along to the end and ask the conductor for the right time so that she could set her watch. She found, however, that his little chair was vacant. She hesitated for a moment and then walked through into the next coach. She looked down the long, dim line of the corridor and saw, to her surprise, that a man was standing with his hand on the door of the compartment occupied by the lady in the mink coat. That is to say, she thought it was the compartment. Probably, however, she was mistaken. He stood there for a moment or two with his back to her, seeming uncertain and hesitating in his attitude. Then he slowly turned, and with an odd feeling of fatality, Katherine recognized him as the same man whom she had noticed twice before--once in the corridor of the Savoy hotel and once in Cook's offices. Then he opened the door of the compartment and passed in, drawing it to behind him. An idea flashed across Katherine's mind. Could this be the man of whom the other woman had spoken--the man she was journeying to meet. Then Katherine told herself that she was romancing. In all probability she had mistaken the compartment. She went back to her own carriage. Five minutes later the train slackened speed. There was the long plaintive hiss of the Westinghouse brake, and a few minutes later the train came to a stop at Lyons.","['light', 'half', 'past', 'nine', 'She', 'woke', 'sudden', 'start', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'know', 'Glancing', 'watch', 'found', 'stopped', 'A', 'feeling', 'intense', 'uneasiness', 'pervaded', 'grew', 'stronger', 'moment', 'moment', 'At', 'last', 'got', 'threw', 'dressing', 'gown', 'round', 'shoulders', 'stepped', 'corridor', 'The', 'whole', 'train', 'seemed', 'wrapped', 'slumber', 'Katherine', 'let', 'window', 'sat', 'minutes', 'drinking', 'cool', 'night', 'air', 'trying', 'vainly', 'calm', 'uneasy', 'fears', 'She', 'presently', 'decided', 'would', 'go', 'along', 'end', 'ask', 'conductor', 'right', 'time', 'could', 'set', 'watch', 'She', 'found', 'however', 'little', 'chair', 'vacant', 'She', 'hesitated', 'moment', 'walked', 'next', 'coach', 'She', 'looked', 'long', 'dim', 'line', 'corridor', 'saw', 'surprise', 'man', 'standing', 'hand', 'door', 'compartment', 'occupied', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'That', 'say', 'thought', 'compartment', 'Probably', 'however', 'mistaken', 'He', 'stood', 'moment', 'two', 'back', 'seeming', 'uncertain', 'hesitating', 'attitude', 'Then', 'slowly', 'turned', 'odd', 'feeling', 'fatality', 'Katherine', 'recognized', 'man', 'noticed', 'twice', '--', 'corridor', 'Savoy', 'hotel', 'Cook', ""'s"", 'offices', 'Then', 'opened', 'door', 'compartment', 'passed', 'drawing', 'behind', 'An', 'idea', 'flashed', 'across', 'Katherine', ""'s"", 'mind', 'Could', 'man', 'woman', 'spoken', '--', 'man', 'journeying', 'meet', 'Then', 'Katherine', 'told', 'romancing', 'In', 'probability', 'mistaken', 'compartment', 'She', 'went', 'back', 'carriage', 'Five', 'minutes', 'later', 'train', 'slackened', 'speed', 'There', 'long', 'plaintive', 'hiss', 'Westinghouse', 'brake', 'minutes', 'later', 'train', 'came', 'stop', 'Lyons']"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,1,"Katherine wakened the next morning to brilliant sunshine. She went along to breakfast early, but met none of her acquaintances of the day before. When she returned to her compartment it had just been restored to its day-time appearance by the conductor, a dark man with a drooping moustache and melancholy face. ""Madame is fortunate,"" he said; ""the sun shines. It is always a great disappointment to passengers when they arrive on a grey morning."" ""I should have been disappointed, certainly,"" said Katherine. The man prepared to depart. ""We are rather late, Madame,"" he said. ""I will let you know just before we get to Nice."" Katherine nodded. She sat by the window, entranced by the sunlit panorama. The palm trees, the deep blue of the sea, the bright yellow mimosa came with all the charm of novelty to the woman who for fourteen years had known only the drab winters of England. When they arrived at Cannes, Katherine got out and walked up and down the platform. She was curious about the lady in the mink coat, and looked up at the windows of her compartment. The blinds were still drawn down--the only ones to be so on the whole train. Katherine wondered a little, and when she re-entered the train she passed along the corridor and noticed that these two compartments were still shuttered and closed. The lady of the mink coat was clearly no early riser. Presently the conductor came to her and told her that in a few minutes the train would arrive at Nice. Katherine handed him a tip; the man thanked her, but still lingered. There was something odd about him. Katherine, who had at first wondered whether the tip had not been big enough, was now convinced that something far more serious was amiss. His face was of a sickly pallor, he was shaking all over, and looked as if he had been frightened out of his life. He was eyeing her in a curious manner.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,2,"""Madame will excuse me, but is she expecting friends to meet her at Nice?"" ""Probably,"" said Katherine. ""Why?"" But the man merely shook his head and murmured something that Katherine could not catch and moved away, not reappearing until the train came to rest at the station, when he started handing her belongings down from the window. Katherine stood for a moment or two on the platform rather at a loss, but a fair young man with an ingenuous face came up to her and said rather hesitatingly: ""Miss Grey, is it not?"" Katherine said that it was, and the young man beamed upon her seraphically and murmured: ""I am Chubby, you know--Lady Tamplin's husband. I expect she mentioned me, but perhaps she forgot. Have you got your _billet de bagages_? I lost mine when I came out this year, and you would not believe the fuss they made about it. Regular French red tape!"" Katherine produced it, and was just about to move off beside him when a very gentle and insidious voice murmured in her ear: ""A little moment, Madame, if you please."" Katherine turned to behold an individual who made up for insignificance of stature by a large quantity of gold lace and uniform. The individual explained. ""There were certain formalities. Madame would perhaps be so kind as to accompany him. The regulations of the police--"" He threw up his arms. ""Absurd, doubtless, but there it was."" Mr. Chubby Evans listened with a very imperfect comprehension, his French being of a limited order. ""So like the French,"" murmured Mr. Evans. He was one of those staunch patriotic Britons who, having made a portion of a foreign country their own, strongly resent the original inhabitants of it. ""Always up to some silly dodge or other. They've never tackled people on the station before, though. This is something quite new. I suppose you'll have to go."" Katherine departed with her guide.

He invited her to mount into this, and, preceding her down the corridor, held aside the door of one of the compartments. In it was a pompous-looking official personage, and with him a nondescript being who appeared to be a clerk. The pompous-looking personage rose politely, bowed to Katherine, and said: ""You will excuse me, Madame, but there are certain formalities to be complied with. Madame speaks French, I trust?"" ""Sufficiently, I think, Monsieur,"" replied Katherine in that language. ""That is good. Pray be seated, Madame. I am M. Caux, the Commissary of Police."" He blew out his chest importantly, and Katherine tried to look sufficiently impressed. ""You wish to see my passport?"" she inquired. ""Here it is."" The Commissary eyed her keenly and gave a little grunt. ""Thank you, Madame,"" he said, taking the passport from her. He cleared his throat. ""But what I really desire is a little information."" ""Information?"" The Commissary nodded his head slowly. ""About a lady who has been a fellow-passenger of yours. You lunched with her yesterday."" ""I am afraid I can't tell you anything about her. We fell into conversation over our meal, but she is a complete stranger to me. I have never seen her before."" ""And yet,"" said the Commissary sharply, ""you returned to her compartment with her after lunch and sat talking for some time?"" ""Yes,"" said Katherine; ""that is true."" The Commissary seemed to expect her to say something more. He looked at her encouragingly. ""Yes, Madame?"" ""Well, Monsieur?"" said Katherine. ""You can, perhaps, give me some kind of idea of that conversation?"" ""I could,"" said Katherine, ""but at the moment I see no reason to do so."" In somewhat British fashion she felt annoyed. This foreign official seemed to her impertinent. ""No reason?"" cried the Commissary. ""Oh yes, Madame, I can assure you that there _is_ a reason."" ""Then perhaps you will give it to me.""

""What was it--heart failure?"" ""No,"" said the Commissary in a reflective, dreamy voice. ""No--she was murdered."" ""Murdered!"" cried Katherine. ""So you see, Madame, why we are anxious for any information we can possibly get."" ""But surely her maid--"" ""The maid has disappeared."" ""Oh!"" Katherine paused to assemble her thoughts. ""Since the conductor had seen you talking with her in her compartment, he quite naturally reported the fact to the police, and that is why, Madame, we have detained you, in the hope of gaining some information.""

""Yes,"" said Katherine thoughtfully. ""I suppose I did."" ""And that impression was--"" ""Yes, Mademoiselle""--the Commissary jerked himself forward--""let us by all means have your impressions."" Katherine sat turning the whole thing over in her mind. She felt in a way as if she were betraying a confidence, but with that ugly word ""Murder"" ringing in her ears she dared not keep anything back. Too much might hang upon it. So, as nearly as she could, she repeated word for word the conversation she had had with the dead woman. ""That is interesting,"" said the Commissary, glancing at the other. ""Eh, M. Poirot, that is interesting? Whether it has anything to do with the crime--"" He left the sentence unfinished. ""I suppose it could not be suicide,"" said Katherine, rather doubtfully. ""No,"" said the Commissary, ""it could not be suicide. She was strangled with a length of black cord."" ""Oh!"" Katherine shivered. M. Caux spread out his hands apologetically. ""It is not nice--no. I think that our train robbers are more brutal than they are in your country."" ""It is horrible."" ""Yes, yes""--he was soothing and apologetic--""but you have great courage, Mademoiselle. At once, as soon as I saw you, I said to myself, 'Mademoiselle has great courage.' That is why I am going to ask you to do something more--something distressing, but I assure you very necessary."" Katherine looked at him apprehensively. He spread out his hands apologetically. ""I am going to ask you, Mademoiselle, to be so good as to accompany me to the next compartment."" ""Must I?"" asked Katherine in a low voice.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,6,"""Mademoiselle is sensible,"" he said. ""May I accompany you, M. Caux?"" ""Enchanted, my dear M. Poirot."" They went out into the corridor, and M. Caux unlocked the door of the dead woman's compartment. The blinds on the far side had been drawn half-way up to admit light. The dead woman lay on the berth to their left, in so natural a posture that one could have thought her asleep. The bedclothes were drawn up over her, and her head was turned to the wall, so that only the red auburn curls showed. Very gently M. Caux laid a hand on her shoulder and turned the body back so that the face came into view. Katherine flinched a little and dug her nails into her palms. A heavy blow had disfigured the features almost beyond recognition. Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. ""When was that done, I wonder?"" he demanded. ""Before death or after?"" ""The doctor says after,"" said M. Caux. ""Strange,"" said Poirot, drawing his brows together. He turned to Katherine. ""Be brave, Mademoiselle; look at her well. Are you sure that this is the woman you talked to in the train yesterday?"" Katherine had good nerves. She steeled herself to look long and earnestly at the recumbent figure. Then she leaned forward and took up the dead woman's hand. ""I am quite sure,"" she replied at length. ""The face is too disfigured to recognize, but the build and carriage and hair are exact, and besides I noticed _this_""--she pointed to a tiny mole on the dead woman's wrist--""while I was talking to her."" ""_Bon_,"" approved Poirot. ""You are an excellent witness, Mademoiselle. There is, then, no question as to the identity, but it is strange, all the same."" He frowned down on the dead woman in perplexity. M. Caux shrugged his shoulders. ""The murderer was carried away by rage, doubtless,"" he suggested.

Did he hope that if the face were unrecognizable she might not be identified? Or did he hate her so much that he could not resist striking that blow even after she was dead?"" Katherine shuddered, and he turned at once to her kindly. ""You must not let me distress you, Mademoiselle,"" he said. ""To you this is all very new and terrible. To me, alas! it is an old story. One moment, I pray of you both."" They stood against the door watching him as he went quickly round the compartment. He noted the dead woman's clothes neatly folded on the end of the berth, the big fur coat that hung from a hook, and the little red lacquer hat tossed up on the rack. Then he passed through into the adjoining compartment, that in which Katherine had seen the maid sitting. Here the berth had not been made up. Three or four rugs were piled loosely on the seat; there was a hat-box and a couple of suit-cases. He turned suddenly to Katherine. ""You were in here yesterday,"" he said. ""Do you see anything changed, anything missing?"" Katherine looked carefully round both compartments. ""Yes,"" she said, ""there is something missing--a scarlet morocco case. It had the initials 'R. V. K.' on it. It might have been a small dressing-case or a big jewel-case. When I saw it, the maid was holding it."" ""Ah!"" said Poirot. ""But, surely,"" said Katherine. ""I--of course, I don't know anything about such things, but surely it is plain enough, if the maid and the jewel-case are missing?"" ""You mean that it was the maid who was the thief? No, Mademoiselle; there is a very good reason against that."" ""What?"" ""The maid was left behind in Paris."" He turned to Poirot.

""Very good, Monsieur le Commissaire. It was after we had left the Gare de Lyon.

She said to me that she had been obliged to leave her maid behind in Paris, so that I need make up only one berth. She took her dinner basket into the adjoining compartment, and sat there while I made up the bed; then she told me that she did not wish to be wakened early in the morning, that she liked to sleep on. I told her I quite understood, and she wished me 'good-night.'"" ""You yourself did not go into the adjoining compartment?"" ""No, Monsieur.""

The other, and the more likely to my mind, is that her assailant was a train robber travelling on the train; that he stole along the corridor unseen by the conductor, killed her, and went off with the red morocco case, which doubtless contained jewels of some value. In all probability he left the train at Lyons, and we have already telegraphed to the station there for full particulars of any one seen leaving the train."" ""Or he might have come on to Nice,"" suggested Poirot. ""He might,"" agreed the Commissary, ""but that would be a very bold course."" Poirot let a minute or two go by before speaking, and then he said: ""In the latter case you think the man was an ordinary train robber?"" The Commissary shrugged his shoulders. ""It depends. We must get hold of the maid. It is possible that she has the red morocco case with her.

Most of Lady Tamplin's guests had arrived, and since noise was the essential of Lady Tamplin's parties, the din was already terrific.

""Ruth is always changing her mind about things at a moment's notice,"" he remarked, and then he added in a would-be careless tone: ""The maid didn't give any--er--reason for this change of plan?""

The secretary's practised ears caught the note of strain underlying the seemingly casual tone. ""Oh, I see. Man or woman?"" ""I think she said a man, sir."" Van Aldin nodded. His worst fears were being realized. He rose from his chair, and began pacing up and down the room, a habit of his when agitated. Unable to contain his feelings any longer, he burst forth: ""There is one thing no man can do, and that is to get a woman to listen to reason.

The man was no better than a common swindler."" ""You are quite right,"" said the Commissary. ""The Comte de la Roche is well known to us. If it were possible, we should have laid him by the heels before now, but _ma foi!_ it is not easy; the fellow is cunning, his affairs are always conducted with ladies of high social position.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,1,"The Comte de la Roche had just finished _déjeuner_, consisting of an _omelette fines herbes_, an _entrecôte Béarnaise_, and a _Savarin au Rhum_. Wiping his fine black moustache delicately with his table napkin, the Comte rose from the table. He passed through the salon of the villa, noting with appreciation the few _objets d'art_ which were carelessly scattered about. The Louis XV snuff-box, the satin shoe worn by Marie Antoinette, and the other historic trifles were part of the Comte's _mise en scène_. They were, he would explain to his fair visitors, heirlooms in his family. Passing through on to the terrace, the Comte looked out on the Mediterranean with an unseeing eye. He was in no mood for appreciating the beauties of scenery. A fully matured scheme had been rudely brought to naught, and his plans had to be cast afresh. Stretching himself out in a basket chair, a cigarette held between his white fingers, the Comte pondered deeply. Presently Hippolyte, his man-servant, brought out coffee and a choice of liqueurs. The Comte selected some very fine old brandy. As the man-servant was preparing to depart, the Comte arrested him with a slight gesture. Hippolyte stood respectfully to attention.

""That is well,"" said the Comte drily; ""nevertheless they will come--I am sure of it. They will ask questions."" Hippolyte looked at his master in intelligent anticipation. The Comte spoke slowly, without looking at Hippolyte. ""As you know, I arrived here last Tuesday morning. If the police or any other inquirer should question you, do not forget that fact.

Occasionally he frowned, once he shook his head slightly, twice he nodded it. Into the midst of these cogitations came Hippolyte once more. ""A lady, Monsieur."" ""A lady?"" The Comte was surprised. Not that a visit from a lady was an unusual thing at the Villa Marina, but at this particular moment the Comte could not think who the lady was likely to be. ""She is, I think, a lady not known to Monsieur,"" murmured the valet helpfully. The Comte was more and more intrigued. ""Show her out here, Hippolyte,"" he commanded. A moment later a marvellous vision in orange and black stepped out on the terrace, accompanied by a strong perfume of exotic blossoms. ""Monsieur le Comte de la Roche?"" ""At your service, Mademoiselle,"" said the Comte, bowing. ""My name is Mirelle. You may have heard of me."" ""Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle, but who has not been enchanted by the dancing of Mademoiselle Mirelle? Exquisite!"" The dancer acknowledged this compliment with a brief mechanical smile.

True, his experience had not lain much in ladies of Mirelle's class, who were themselves predatory. He and the dancer were, in a sense, birds of a feather. His arts, the Comte knew, would be thrown away on Mirelle. She was a Parisienne, and a shrewd one. Nevertheless, there was one thing that the Comte could recognize infallibly when he saw it. He knew at once that he was in the presence of a very angry woman, and an angry woman, as the Comte was well aware, always says more than is prudent, and is occasionally a source of profit to a level-headed gentleman who keeps cool. ""It is most amiable of you, Mademoiselle, to honour my poor abode thus."" ""We have mutual friends in Paris,"" said Mirelle.

Mirelle bent forward, her dark eyes flashing. ""It is not the idle talk of those in the streets. It is the police."" ""The police--ah?"" The Comte sat up, alert once more. Mirelle nodded her head vigorously several times. ""Yes, yes. You comprehend me--I have friends every where.

""He boasted of it beforehand. He was ruined, bankrupt, dishonoured. Only the death of his wife could save him. He told me so. He travelled on the same train--but she was not to know it.

Upon that she was gone, an impetuous whirlwind, her errand accomplished. The Comte looked after her, his eyebrows delicately raised. ""She is in a fury,"" he murmured. ""What has happened now to upset her? But she shows her hand too plainly. Does she really believe that Mr. Kettering killed his wife? She would like me to believe it. She would even like the police to believe it."" He smiled to himself. He had no intention whatsoever of going to the police.

He went into the house and questioned Hippolyte closely once more as to whether any strangers had been to the house. The valet was positive in his assurances that this was not the case. The Comte went up to his bedroom and crossed over to an old bureau that stood against the wall. He let down the lid of this, and his delicate fingers sought for a spring at the back of one of the pigeon-holes. A secret drawer flew out; in it was a small brown paper package. The Comte took this out and weighed it in his hand carefully for a minute or two. Raising his hand to his head, with a slight grimace he pulled out a single hair. This he placed on the lip of the drawer and shut it carefully. Still carrying the small parcel in his hand, he went downstairs and out of the house to the garage, where stood a scarlet two-seater car. Ten minutes later he had taken the road for Monte Carlo.

The little red car had been specially built to the Comte's design, and had a far more powerful engine than would have been suspected from its appearance. It shot ahead. Presently he looked back and smiled; the grey car was following behind. Smothered in dust, the little red car leaped along the road. It was travelling now at a dangerous pace, but the Comte was a first-class driver. Now they were going down hill, twisting and curving unceasingly.

Lenox adopted a detached attitude, seemingly amused at her mother's manœuvres, and yet with a sympathetic understanding of Katherine's feelings. The situation was not helped by Chubby, whose naïve delight was unquenchable, and who introduced Katherine to all and sundry as: ""This is Miss Grey. You know that Blue Train business?

She hesitated, but, as Poirot had foreseen, she had no loophole for escape. ""Very well,"" she muttered. ""I will fetch a coat."" Left alone together, Poirot and Knighton exchanged glances.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,5,"she will wish to draw back. We must prevent that at all costs."" Mirelle reappeared, wrapped in a sand-coloured velvet wrap trimmed with leopard skin. She looked not altogether unlike a leopardess, tawny and dangerous. Her eyes still flashed with anger and determination. They found M. Caux and the Examining Magistrate together. A few brief introductory words from Poirot, and Mademoiselle Mirelle was courteously entreated to tell her tale. This she did in much the same words as she had done to Knighton and Poirot, though with far more soberness of manner. ""This is an extraordinary story, Mademoiselle,"" said M. Carrège slowly. He leant back in his chair, adjusted his pince-nez, and looked keenly and searchingly at the dancer through them. ""You wish us to believe M. Kettering actually boasted of the crime to you beforehand?"" ""Yes, yes. She was too healthy, he said. If she were to die it must be an accident--he would arrange it all."" ""You are aware, Mademoiselle,"" said M. Carrège sternly, ""that you are making yourself out to be an accessory before the fact?"" ""Me? But not the least in the world, Monsieur. Not for a moment did I take that statement seriously. Ah no, indeed! I know men, Monsieur; they say many wild things. It would be an odd state of affairs if one were to take all they said _au pied de la lettre_."" The Examining Magistrate raised his eyebrows. ""We are to take it, then, that you regarded M. Kettering's threats as mere idle words? May I ask, Mademoiselle, what made you throw up your engagements in London and come out to the Riviera?"" Mirelle looked at him with melting black eyes. ""I wished to be with the man I loved,"" she said simply. ""Was it so unnatural?"" Poirot interpolated a question gently. ""Was it, then, at M. Kettering's wish that you accompanied him to Nice?""

""In such matters I please myself, Monsieur,"" she said. That the answer was not an answer at all was noted by all three men. They said nothing. ""When were you first convinced that M. Kettering had murdered his wife?"" ""As I tell you, Monsieur, I saw M. Kettering come out of his wife's compartment just before the train drew into Lyons. There was a look on his face--ah! at the moment I could not understand it--a look haunted and terrible. I shall never forget it."" Her voice rose shrilly, and she flung out her arms in an extravagant gesture. ""Quite so,"" said M. Carrège. ""Afterwards, when I found that Madame Kettering was dead when the train left Lyons, then--then I knew!"" ""And still--you did not go to the police, Mademoiselle,"" said the Commissary mildly. Mirelle glanced at him superbly; she was clearly enjoying herself in the rôle she was playing. ""Shall I betray my lover?"" she asked. ""Ah no; do not ask a woman to do that."" ""Yet now--"" hinted M. Caux. ""Now it is different. He has betrayed me! Shall I suffer that in silence...?"" The Examining Magistrate checked her. ""Quite so, quite so,"" he murmured soothingly. ""And now, Mademoiselle, perhaps you will read over the statement of what you have told us, see that it is correct, and sign it."" Mirelle wasted no time on the document. ""Yes, yes,"" she said, ""it is correct."" She rose to her feet. ""You require me no longer, Messieurs?"" ""At present, no, Mademoiselle."" ""And Dereek will be arrested?"" ""At once, Mademoiselle."" Mirelle laughed cruelly and drew her fur draperies closer about her. ""He should have thought of this before he insulted me,"" she cried.

I--"" She came to an abrupt stop. Poirot was regarding her intently, and he saw the wary look that came into her eyes. ""I have been told so. Everybody says so."" ""Oh,"" said Poirot, ""I was not aware that the fact had been mentioned outside the Examining Magistrate's office."" Mirelle appeared somewhat discomposed. ""One hears those things,"" she said vaguely; ""they get about. Somebody told me. I can't remember who it was."" She moved to the door. M. Caux sprang forward to open it for her, and as he did so, Poirot's voice rose gently once more. ""And the jewels? Pardon, Mademoiselle. Can you tell me anything about those?"" ""The jewels? What jewels?"" ""The rubies of Catherine the Great. Since you hear so much, you must have heard of them."" ""I know nothing about any jewels,"" said Mirelle sharply. She went out, closing the door behind her. M. Caux came back to his chair; the Examining Magistrate sighed. ""What a fury!"" he said, ""but _diablement chic_, I wonder if she is telling the truth? I think so."" ""There is _some_ truth in her story, certainly,"" said Poirot. ""We have confirmation of it from Miss Grey. She was looking down the corridor a short time before the train reached Lyons and she saw M. Kettering go into his wife's compartment."" ""The case against him seems quite clear,"" said the Commissary, sighing; ""it is a thousand pities,"" he murmured. ""How do you mean?"" asked Poirot.

Taking a paper-cutter from his pocket, he slit it open. It was a long telegram, and he read it over twice before slowly putting it in his pocket. Upstairs, George was awaiting his master. ""I am fatigued, Georges, much fatigued. Will you order for me a small pot of chocolate?"" The chocolate was duly ordered and brought, and George set it at the little table at his master's elbow. As he was preparing to retire, Poirot spoke: ""I believe, Georges, that you have a good knowledge of the English aristocracy?"" murmured Poirot. George smiled apologetically. ""I think that I might say that I have, sir,"" he replied. ""I suppose that it is your opinion, Georges, that criminals are invariably drawn from the lower orders."" ""Not always, sir. There was great trouble with one of the Duke of Devize's younger sons. He left Eton under a cloud, and after that he caused great anxiety on several occasions.

""I often wonder having lived so exclusively with titled families that you demean yourself by coming as a valet to me. I put it down to love of excitement on your part."" ""Not exactly, sir,"" said George. ""I happened to see in _Society Snippets_ that you had been received at Buckingham Palace. That was just when I was looking for a new situation.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,1,"Poirot started to keep his dinner appointment with a margin of three-quarters of an hour to spare. He had an object in this. The car took him, not straight to Monte Carlo, but to Lady Tamplin's house at Cap Martin, where he asked for Miss Grey. The ladies were dressing and Poirot was shown into a small salon to wait, and here, after a lapse of three or four minutes, Lenox Tamplin came to him. ""Katherine is not quite ready yet,"" she said. ""Can I give her a message, or would you rather wait until she comes down?"" Poirot looked at her thoughtfully. He was a minute or two in replying, as though something of great weight hung upon his decision. Apparently the answer to such a simple question mattered. ""No,"" he said at last, ""no, I do not think it is necessary that I should wait to see Mademoiselle Katherine. I think, perhaps, that it is better that I should not. These things are sometimes difficult."" Lenox waited politely, her eyebrows slightly raised. ""I have a piece of news,"" continued Poirot. ""You will, perhaps, tell your friend. M. Kettering was arrested to-night for the murder of his wife."" ""You want me to tell Katherine that?"" asked Lenox. She breathed rather hard, as though she had been running; her face, Poirot thought, looked white and strained--rather noticeably so. ""If you please, Mademoiselle."" ""Why?"" said Lenox.

""You believe he did it?"" she said abruptly. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""The police say so."" ""Ah,"" said Lenox, ""hedging, are you? So there is something to hedge about."" Again she was silent, frowning. Poirot said gently: ""You have known Derek Kettering a long time, have you not?"" ""Off and on ever since I was a kid,"" said Lenox gruffly. Poirot nodded his head several times without speaking. With one of her brusque movements Lenox drew forward a chair and sat down on it, her elbows on the table and her face supported by her hands. Sitting thus, she looked directly across the table at Poirot. ""What have they got to go on?"" she demanded. ""Motive, I suppose. Probably came into money at her death."" ""He came into two million."" ""And if she had not died he would have been ruined?"" ""Yes."" ""But there must have been more than that,"" persisted Lenox. ""He travelled by the same train, I know, but--that would not be enough to go on by itself."" ""A cigarette case with the letter 'K' on it which did not belong to Mrs. Kettering was found in her carriage, and he was seen by two people entering and leaving the compartment just before the train got into Lyons.""

""The doctors' evidence necessarily cannot be very definite,"" said Poirot; ""they are inclined to think that death was unlikely to have occurred after leaving Lyons. And we know this much, that a few moments after leaving Lyons Mrs. Kettering was dead."" ""How do you know that?"" Poirot was smiling rather oddly to himself. ""Some one else went into her compartment and found her dead."" ""And they did not rouse the train?"" ""No."" ""Why was that?"" ""Doubtless they had their reasons."" Lenox looked at him sharply. ""Do you know the reason?"" ""I think so--yes."" Lenox sat still turning things over in her mind. Poirot watched her in silence. At last she looked up. A soft colour had come into her cheeks and her eyes were shining. ""You think some one on the train must have killed her, but that need not be so at all. What is to stop any one swinging themselves on to the train when it stopped at Lyons? They could go straight to her compartment, strangle her, and take the rubies and drop off the train again without any one being the wiser. She may have been actually killed while the train was in Lyons station. Then she would have been alive when Derek went in, and dead when the other person found her."" Poirot leant back in his chair. He drew a deep breath. He looked across at the girl and nodded his head three times, then he heaved a sigh. ""Mademoiselle,"" he said, ""what you have said there is very just--very true.

""You are meeting some one?"" ""Yes."" ""Some one who knows something?"" ""Some one who might know something. In these matters one must leave no stone unturned. Au revoir, Mademoiselle.""

When the car had driven off he relapsed into a frowning absorption, but in his eyes was that faint green light which was always the precursor of the triumph to be. He was a few minutes late at the rendezvous, and found that M. Papopolous and his daughter had arrived before him. His apologies were abject, and he outdid himself in politeness and small attentions. The Greek was looking particularly benign and noble this evening, a sorrowful patriarch of blameless life. Zia was looking handsome and good humoured. The dinner was a pleasant one. Poirot was his best and most sparkling self. He told anecdotes, he made jokes, he paid graceful compliments to Zia Papopolous, and he told many interesting incidents of his career. The menu was a carefully selected one, and the wine was excellent. At the close of dinner M. Papopolous inquired politely: ""And the tip I gave you? You have had your little flutter on the horse?""

""No,"" said Poirot; ""it is what our friends, the English, call a dark horse."" ""Ah!"" said M. Papopolous thoughtfully. ""Now we must step across to the Casino and have our little flutter at the roulette table,"" cried Poirot gaily. At the Casino the party separated, Poirot devoting himself solely to Zia, whilst Papopolous himself drifted away. Poirot was not fortunate, but Zia had a run of good luck, and had soon won a few thousand francs. ""It would be as well,"" she observed drily to Poirot, ""if I stopped now."" Poirot's eyes twinkled. ""Superb!"" he exclaimed. ""You are the daughter of your father, Mademoiselle Zia. To know when to stop. Ah! that is the art."" He looked round the rooms. ""I cannot see your father anywhere about,"" he remarked carelessly. ""I will fetch your cloak for you, Mademoiselle, and we will go out in the gardens."" He did not, however, go straight to the cloak-room. His sharp eyes had seen but a little while before the departure of M. Papopolous. He was anxious to know what had become of the wily Greek. He ran him to earth unexpectedly in the big entrance hall. He was standing by one of the pillars, talking to a lady who had just arrived. The lady was Mirelle. Poirot sidled unostentatiously round the room. He arrived at the other side of the pillar, and unnoticed by the two who were talking together in an animated fashion--or rather, that is to say, the dancer was talking, Papopolous contributing an occasional monosyllable and a good many expressive gestures.

""Only a very little while,"" pleaded the other. ""Ah! but you must! A week--ten days--that is all I ask. You can be sure of your affair. The money will be forthcoming."" Papopolous shifted a little and looked round him uneasily--to find Poirot almost at his elbow with a beaming innocent face. ""_Ah! vous voilà_, M. Papopolous. I have been looking for you. It is permitted that I take Mademoiselle Zia for a little turn in the gardens? Good evening, Mademoiselle."" He bowed very low to Mirelle. ""A thousand pardons that I did not see you immediately."" The dancer accepted his greetings rather impatiently. She was clearly annoyed at the interruption of her _tête-à-tête_. Poirot was quick to take the hint. Papopolous had already murmured: ""Certainly--but certainly,"" and Poirot withdrew forthwith. He fetched Zia's cloak, and together they strolled out into the gardens. ""This is where the suicides take place,"" said Zia. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""So it is said. Men are foolish, are they not, Mademoiselle? To eat, to drink, to breathe the good air, it is a very pleasant thing, Mademoiselle.

""I might,"" said the girl. ""You were interested in him, eh? It was that that took you to the keyhole."" Zia nodded. ""Yes, yes. I was curious.

Everything goes on much the same here. There was great trouble about the new curate, who is scandalously high. In my view, he is neither more nor less than a Roman. Everybody has spoken to the Vicar about it, but you know what the Vicar is--all Christian charity and no proper spirit. I have had a lot of trouble with maids lately. That girl Annie was no good--skirts up to her knees and wouldn't wear sensible woollen stockings. Not one of them can bear being spoken to. I have had a lot of pain with my rheumatism one way and another, and Dr. Harris persuaded me to go and see a London specialist--a waste of three guineas and a railway fare, as I told him; but by waiting until Wednesday I managed to get a cheap return. The London doctor pulled a long face and talked all round about and never straight out, until I said to him, 'I'm a plain woman, Doctor, and I like things to be plainly stated. Is it cancer, or is it not?' And then, of course, he had to say it was. They say a year with care, and not too much pain, though I am sure I can bear pain as well as any other Christian woman.

However, if things should go ill with you--and that is always possible. I have heard no end of tales of bogus noblemen marrying girls and getting hold of their money and then leaving them at the church door. I dare say you are too sensible for anything of the kind to happen to you, but one never knows; and never having had much attention of any kind it might easily go to your head now.

""Nothing,"" said Katherine, grabbing up Miss Viner's letter and thrusting it into her handbag. ""You looked rather queer,"" said Lenox. ""I say--I hope you don't mind--I rang up your detective friend, M. Poirot, and asked him to lunch with us in Nice. I said you wanted to see him, as I thought he might not come for me."" ""Did you want to see him then?"" asked Katherine. ""Yes,"" said Lenox. ""I have rather lost my heart to him. I never met a man before whose eyes were really green like a cat's."" ""All right,"" said Katherine. She spoke listlessly. The last few days had been trying. Derek Kettering's arrest had been the topic of the hour, and the Blue Train Mystery had been thrashed out from every conceivable standpoint. ""I have ordered the car,"" said Lenox, ""and I have told Mother some lie or other--unfortunately I can't remember exactly what; but it won't matter, as she never remembers. If she knew where we were going, she would want to come too, to pump M. Poirot."" The two girls arrived at the Negresco to find Poirot waiting. He was full of Gallic politeness, and showered so many compliments upon the two girls that they were soon helpless with laughter; yet for all that the meal was not a gay one. Katherine was dreamy and distracted, and Lenox made bursts of conversation, interspersed by silences. As they were sitting on the terrace sipping their coffee she suddenly attacked Poirot bluntly.

""Ah, it is pretty what you say there."" ""Here is Major Knighton,"" said Lenox. Katherine looked round quickly and then turned back again. ""He is with Mr. Van Aldin,"" continued Lenox. ""There is something I want to ask Major Knighton about. I won't be a minute."" Left alone together, Poirot bent forward and murmured to Katherine: ""You are _distraite_, Mademoiselle; your thoughts, they are far away, are they not?"" ""Just as far as England, no farther."" Guided by a sudden impulse, she took the letter she had received that morning and handed it across to him to read. ""That is the first word that has come to me from my old life; somehow or other--it hurts."" He read it through and then handed it back to her.

He strolled across to where Lenox Tamplin was talking to Van Aldin and Knighton. The American looked old and haggard. He greeted Poirot with a curt nod but without any other sign of animation.

""I wish,"" he murmured, ""that you could tell Miss Grey that."" ""Tell her what?"" ""That you--I mean that M. Van Aldin is returning to England."" Knighton looked a little puzzled, but he readily crossed the terrace and joined Katherine. Poirot saw him go with a satisfied nod of the head, and then joined Lenox and the American. After a minute or two they joined the others. Conversation was general for a few minutes, then the millionaire and his secretary departed. Poirot also prepared to take his departure.

The Comte de la Roche himself had gone to Monte Carlo for the day. Chancing to look out of the window, Hippolyte espied a visitor walking briskly up to the hall door, a visitor of so uncommon a type that Hippolyte, experienced as he was, had some difficulty in placing him. Calling to his wife, Marie, who was busy in the kitchen, he drew her attention to what he called _ce type là_. ""It is not the police again?"" said Marie anxiously. ""Look for yourself,"" said Hippolyte. Marie looked. ""Certainly not the police,"" she declared. ""I am glad."" ""They have not really worried us much,"" said Hippolyte.

""Permit me to say that you have been badly educated. It is the name of one of the great ones of this world."" He sighed and folded his hands across his chest.

Facing him was a relieved but very puzzled man. Poirot leant back in his chair, lit one of his tiny cigarettes, and stared reflectively at the ceiling. ""Yes, I will give you explanations. It began with the one point that puzzled me. You know what that point was? _The disfigured face._ It is not an uncommon thing to find when investigating a crime and it rouses an immediate question, the question of identity. That naturally was the first thing that occurred to me. Was the dead woman really Mrs. Kettering?

The cigarette case found in the railway carriage and which she told us was one which Mrs. Kettering had given to her husband. Now that was, on the face of it, most improbable, seeing the terms that they were on. It awakened a doubt in my mind as to the general veracity of Ada Mason's statements. There was the rather suspicious fact to be taken into consideration, that she had only been with her mistress for two months. Certainly it did not seem as if she could have had anything to do with the crime since she had been left behind in Paris and Mrs. Kettering had been seen alive by several people afterwards, but--"" Poirot leant forward.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,2,"I am told. I say to myself: how do we know that Ada Mason was left behind in Paris? And at first the answer to that question seemed completely satisfactory. There was the evidence of your secretary, Major Knighton, a complete outsider whose testimony might be supposed to be entirely impartial, and there was the dead woman's own words to the conductor on the train. But I put the latter point aside for the moment, because a very curious idea--an idea perhaps fantastic and impossible--was growing up in my mind. If by any outside chance it happened to be true, that particular piece of testimony was worthless. ""I concentrated on the chief stumbling-block to my theory, Major Knighton's statement that he saw Ada Mason at the Ritz after the Blue Train had left Paris. That seemed conclusive enough, but yet, on examining the facts carefully, I noted two things. First, that by a curious coincidence he, too, had been exactly two months in your service. Secondly, his initial letter was the same--'K.' Supposing--just supposing--that it was _his_ cigarette case which had been found in the carriage. Then, if Ada Mason and he were working together, and she recognized it when we showed it to her, would she not act precisely as she had done? At first, taken aback, she quickly evolved a plausible theory that would agree with Mr. Kettering's guilt. _Bien entendu_, that was not the original idea. The Comte de la Roche was to be the scapegoat, though Ada Mason would not make her recognition of him too certain, in case he should be able to prove an alibi.

He had not previously spoken to Mrs. Kettering, you remember. True, he had seen the maid just for a moment when she handed him the tickets, but his impression had been merely that of a gaunt, black-clad female. If he had been an unusually intelligent man, he might have gone so far as to say that mistress and maid were not unlike, but it is extremely unlikely that he would even think that. And remember, Ada Mason, or Kitty Kidd, was an actress, able to change her appearance and tone of voice at a moment's notice.

Explanations,5,"her compartment after the train left Paris, and she provided against that difficulty by ordering a dinner basket and by locking herself in her compartment."" ""But who killed Ruth--and when?"" ""First, bear it in mind that the crime was planned and undertaken by the two of them--Knighton and Ada Mason, working together. Knighton was in Paris that day on your business. He boarded the train somewhere on its way round the _ceinture_. Mrs. Kettering would be surprised, but she would be quite unsuspicious. Perhaps he draws her attention to something out the window, and as she turns to look he slips the cord round her neck--and the whole thing is over in a second or two. The door of the compartment is locked, and he and Ada Mason set to work. They strip off the dead woman's outer clothes. Mason and Knighton roll the body up in a rug and put it on the seat in the adjoining compartment amongst the bags and suit-cases. Knighton drops off the train, taking the jewel-case containing the rubies with him. Since the crime is not supposed to have been committed until nearly twelve hours later he is perfectly safe, and his evidence and the supposed Mrs. Kettering's words to the conductor will provide a perfect alibi for his accomplice. ""At the Gare de Lyon Ada Mason gets a dinner basket, and shutting herself into the toilet compartment she quickly changes into her mistress's clothes, adjusts two false bunches of auburn curls, and generally makes up to resemble her as closely as possible. When the conductor comes to make up the bed, she tells him the prepared story about having left her maid behind in Paris; and whilst he is making up the berth, she stands looking out of the window, so that her back is towards the corridor and people passing along there.

""Before getting to Lyons, Ada Mason arranged her mistress's body in the bunk, folded up the dead woman's clothes neatly on the end of it, and herself changed into a man's clothes and prepared to leave the train. When Derek Kettering entered his wife's compartment, and, as he thought, saw her asleep in her berth, the scene had been set, and Ada Mason was hidden in the next compartment waiting for the moment to leave the train unobserved. As soon as the conductor had swung himself down on to the platform at Lyons, she follows, slouching along as though just taking a breath of air. At a moment when she is unobserved, she hurriedly crosses to the other platform, and takes the first train back to Paris and the Ritz Hotel. Her name has been registered there as taking a room the night before by one of Knighton's female accomplices. She has nothing to do but wait there placidly for your arrival. The jewels are not, and never have been, in her possession. No suspicion attaches to him, and, as your secretary, he brings them to Nice without the least fear of discovery. Their delivery there to Monsieur Papopolous is already arranged for and they are entrusted to Mason at the last moment to hand over to the Greek. Altogether a very neatly planned coup, as one would expect from a master of the game such as the Marquis.""

""It was very astutely done--so astutely done that it deceived a man whose knowledge of other men is as great as yours is."" ""I looked up his antecedents too. The fellow's record was excellent."" ""Yes, yes; that was part of the game. As Richard Knighton his life was quite free from reproach. He was well born, well connected, did honourable service in the War, and seemed altogether above suspicion; but when I came to glean information about the mysterious Marquis, I found many points of similarity. Knighton spoke French like a Frenchman, he had been in America, France, and England at much the same time as the Marquis was operating. The Marquis was last heard of as engineering various jewel robberies in Switzerland, and it was in Switzerland that you had come across Major Knighton; and it was at precisely that time that the first rumours were going round of your being in treaty for the famous rubies."" ""But why murder?"" murmured Van Aldin brokenly. ""Surely a clever thief could have stolen the jewels without running his head into a noose."" Poirot shook his head.

This plan was, so he thought, completely safe. No possible suspicion could attach to Richard Knighton. But like all great men--and the Marquis was a great man--he had his weaknesses. He fell genuinely in love with Miss Grey, and suspecting her liking for Derek Kettering, he could not resist the temptation to saddle him with the crime when the opportunity presented itself. And now, Monsieur Van Aldin, I am going to tell you something very curious. Miss Grey is not a fanciful woman by any means, yet she firmly believes that she felt your daughter's presence beside her one day in the Casino Gardens at Monte Carlo, just after she had been having a long talk with Knighton. She was convinced, she says, that the dead woman was urgently trying to tell her something, and it suddenly came to her that what the dead woman was trying to say was that Knighton was her murderer! The idea seemed so fantastic at the time that Miss Grey spoke of it to no one. But she was so convinced of its truth that she acted on it--wild as it seemed. She did not discourage Knighton's advances, and she pretended to him that she was convinced of Derek Kettering's guilt."" ""Extraordinary,"" said Van Aldin. ""Yes, it is very strange.

When I was in London I went to the surgeon in question, and I got several technical details from him which confirmed me in that belief. I mentioned the name of that surgeon in Knighton's hearing the day before yesterday. The natural thing would have been for Knighton to mention that he had been attended by him during the War, but he said nothing--and that little point, if nothing else, gave me the last final assurance that my theory of the crime was correct. Miss Grey, too, provided me with a cutting, showing that there had been a robbery at Lady Tamplin's hospital during the time that Knighton had been there.
