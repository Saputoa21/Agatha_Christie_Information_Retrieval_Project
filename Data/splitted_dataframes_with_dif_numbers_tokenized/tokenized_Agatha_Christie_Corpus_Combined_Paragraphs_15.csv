3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,1,"I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen—one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two","['I', 'went', 'home', 'feeling', 'exultation', 'My', 'scheme', 'succeeded', 'far', 'better', 'I', 'could', 'possibly', 'hoped', 'Lord', 'Nasby', 'positively', 'genial', 'It', 'remained', 'Make', 'good', 'expressed', 'Once', 'locked', 'room', 'I', 'took', 'precious', 'piece', 'paper', 'studied', 'attentively', 'Here', 'clue', 'mystery', 'To', 'begin', 'figures', 'represent', 'There', 'five', 'dot', 'first', 'two', 'Seventeen', 'one', 'hundred', 'twenty', 'two', 'I', 'murmured', 'That', 'seem', 'lead', 'anything', 'Next', 'I', 'added', 'That', 'often', 'done', 'works', 'fiction', 'leads', 'surprising', 'deductions', 'One', 'seven', 'make', 'eight', 'one', 'nine', 'two']"

Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless. I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13”—like that. There was a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual.

3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,3,"and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?) Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure. Figures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right, seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps. That sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible. I made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books of reference. _Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of Scotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other’s British Isles.

There _must_ be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow?

And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let—presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host.

In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers. “Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not—not where——” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like——” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying.

There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now—servants and all that, you know. If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am.

His eyes, light eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining. Excited, _I_ thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong.

All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House.

That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin.

On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him—but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily.

James, on the other hand, is not a good gardener—but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to live in solely on account of Caroline’s cooking. “I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett. “You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said.

Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace.

We stared at each other and he stared me down. “Very well,” I said feebly. “You will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.” “Very well,” I said again. After all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but I had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when I thought I had attained peace! I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart. “It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed.

When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm. I regret to say that at the first roll the _Kilmorden_ gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.” “Yes?” I said, curbing my impatience. “Miss Emery is leaving me.” Miss Emery was the governness. “As you have not yet succeeded in finding anything, I wondered if you would care—it would be so nice if you remained with us altogether?” I was touched.

Getting up, I ran impulsively across the room and flung my arms round her neck. “You’re a dear,” I said. “A dear, a dear, a dear! And thank you ever so much. But it’s all right, I’m off to South Africa on Saturday.” My abrupt onslaught had startled the good lady. She was not used to sudden demonstrations of affection. My words startled her still more. “To South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything of that kind very carefully.” That was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already taken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the duties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on the spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at getting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further query.

I could not have continued to live in the same house with her, but I did recognize her intrinsic worth. So here I was, with twenty-five pounds in my pocket, facing the world and pursuing my adventure. It was on the fourth day that the stewardess finally urged me up on deck. Under the impression that I should die quicker below, I had steadfastly refused to leave my bunk. She now tempted me with the advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the boat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry land. Muffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was hauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay there with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired young man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me. “Hullo!

But I’ve seen people much worse than you, and two days later they were the life and soul of the ship. You’ll be the same.” I did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that he was a liar. I endeavoured to convey it by a glance. He chatted pleasantly for a few minutes more, then he mercifully departed. People passed and repassed, brisk couples “exercising,” curveting children, laughing young people. A few other pallid sufferers lay, like myself, in deck-chairs. The air was pleasant, crisp, not too cold, and the sun was shining brightly. Insensibly, I felt a little cheered. I began to watch the people. One woman in particular attracted me. She was about thirty, of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face and very blue eyes. Her clothes, though perfectly plain, had that indefinable air of “cut” about them which spoke of Paris. Also, in a pleasant but self-possessed way, she seemed to own the ship!

She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so without being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered—but of course I shouldn’t—it would amuse me to talk to her. We reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move, but I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board and spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers too. I buried my nose in an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly. When it came I enjoyed it. My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day.

When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him. The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday.

Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy—he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered. “I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we?

Some of my photographs are very good.” “About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are—but I’ve got another roll.” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared","['Mrs.', 'Blair', 'laughed', 'You', 'unkind', 'Some', 'photographs', 'good', 'About', 'three', 'per', 'cent', 'effective', 'I', 'say', 'We', 'went', 'round', 'side', 'deck', 'There', 'glimmering', 'white', 'snowy', 'enveloped', 'delicate', 'rose', 'coloured', 'mist', 'rose', 'glistening', 'pinnacle', 'I', 'uttered', 'exclamation', 'delight', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'ran', 'camera', 'Undeterred', 'Colonel', 'Race', '’s', 'sardonic', 'comments', 'snapped', 'vigorously', 'There', '’s', 'end', 'roll', 'Oh', 'tone', 'changed', 'one', 'chagrin', 'I', '’ve', 'thing', 'bulb', 'time', 'I', 'always', 'like', 'see', 'child', 'new', 'toy', 'murmured', 'Colonel', 'How', 'horrid', 'I', '’ve', 'got', 'another', 'roll', 'She', 'produced', 'triumph', 'pocket', 'sweater', 'A', 'sudden', 'roll', 'boat', 'upset', 'balance', 'caught', 'rail', 'steady', 'roll', 'films', 'flashed', 'side', 'Oh', 'cried', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'comically', 'dismayed', 'She', 'leaned', 'Do', 'think', 'gone', 'overboard', 'No', 'may', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'brain', 'unlucky', 'steward', 'deck', 'A', 'small', 'boy', 'arrived', 'unobserved', 'paces', 'rear', 'blew', 'deafening', 'blast', 'bugle', 'Lunch', 'declared']"

Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly. “Yes, I _do_ feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man.

Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea’s been too much for both of them. The other fellow hasn’t turned up yet. This man’s name is Pagett.” So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board. Probably only a coincidence, and yet—— “That’s Sir Eustace,” my informant continued, “sitting next to the Captain. Pompous old ass.” The more I studied the secretary’s face, the less I liked it. Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head—it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension. Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in.

3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,11,"that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work——” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not_ 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward.

3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,12,"the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir—larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed.

Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene.

You _will_ let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were—whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful.

You might move into that—just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad—quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What _was_ the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that—and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. Something——Ah! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how—— I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it?

Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice.

They had been human—he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation.

He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes—er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure. “Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks—I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace—but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento!

Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly.

I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion—that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head.

It’s full of trunks.” From his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles, something that had no business to be there.

He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk——” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons.

He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it?

Apparently he, and a Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come to blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter. “Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,” he reiterated. “But they wouldn’t look at them.” “Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You _told_ me to get Cabin 17.”","['mean', '’s', 'haunted', 'I', 'said', '’re', 'going', 'sleep', 'I', 'n’t', 'see', 'matters', 'Ghosts', 'n’t', 'affect', 'typewriters', 'Pagett', 'said', 'n’t', 'ghost', 'n’t', 'got', 'Cabin', '17', 'He', 'told', 'long', 'garbled', 'story', 'Apparently', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'girl', 'called', 'Beddingfeld', 'almost', 'come', 'blows', 'cabin', 'Needless', 'say', 'girl', 'Pagett', 'apparently', 'feeling', 'sore', 'matter', 'Both', '13', '28', 'better', 'cabins', 'reiterated', 'But', 'would', 'n’t', 'look', 'Well', 'I', 'said', 'stifling', 'yawn', 'matter', 'would', 'dear', 'Pagett', 'He', 'gave', 'reproachful', 'look', 'You', 'told', 'get', 'Cabin', '17']"

I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance.

So will you.” Pagett shuddered. “So go down to the barber’s and see about it,” I finished. “I don’t think he’ll have any out sizes,” murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye.

He turned sharply and saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head.

It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one! And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man.

He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No—I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But—but a stewardess came the other night—about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair.

A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life—that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life.

It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes.

I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard!

You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary—not that long-faced Pagett, the other one—you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle.

There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her.

Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.”","['secretary', 'There', 'would', 'point', 'timing', 'special', 'hour', 'special', 'day', 'special', 'place', 'No', 'must', 'kind', 'appointment', 'way', 'keep', 'knifed', 'But', 'appointment', 'Certainly', 'It', 'might', 'Chichester', 'Or', 'might', 'Pagett', 'That', 'seems', 'unlikely', 'I', 'objected', 'see', 'time', 'We', 'sat', 'silent', 'minute', 'two', 'Suzanne', 'started', 'another', 'tack', 'Could', 'anything', 'hidden', 'cabin', 'That', 'seems', 'probable', 'I', 'agreed', 'It', 'would', 'explain', 'things', 'ransacked', 'next', 'morning', 'But', 'nothing', 'hidden', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'The', 'young', 'man', 'could', 'n’t', 'slipped', 'something', 'drawer', 'night', 'I', 'shook', 'head', 'I', 'seen']"

It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd—but it’s Cabin 71! _My_ cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you might have thought we had solved the whole mystery.

In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all—and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business.

With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films—that struck a more recent note. Where had I heard of a roll of films?

It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles?

Of course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing the purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the steward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the _Kilmorden_ seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on.

I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. “I have always longed to go to Italy,” I said. “And especially to Florence. Didn’t you enjoy it very much there?” “Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is some correspondence of Sir Eustace’s that——” I took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve. “Oh, you mustn’t run","['Naturally', 'Chichester', 'first', 'claim', 'attention', 'Indeed', 'I', 'point', 'reluctantly', 'dismissing', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'position', 'suspicious', 'characters', 'chance', 'conversation', 'awakened', 'fresh', 'doubts', 'mind', 'I', 'forgotten', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', '’s', 'incomprehensible', 'emotion', 'mention', 'Florence', 'On', 'last', 'evening', 'board', 'sitting', 'deck', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'addressed', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'question', 'secretary', 'I', 'forget', 'exactly', 'something', 'railway', 'delays', 'Italy', 'I', 'noticed', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'displaying', 'uneasiness', 'caught', 'attention', 'When', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'claimed', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'dance', 'I', 'quickly', 'moved', 'chair', 'next', 'secretary', 'I', 'determined', 'get', 'bottom', 'matter', 'I', 'always', 'longed', 'go', 'Italy', 'I', 'said', 'And', 'especially', 'Florence', 'Did', 'n’t', 'enjoy', 'much', 'Indeed', 'I', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'If', 'excuse', 'correspondence', 'Sir', 'Eustace', '’s', 'I', 'took', 'hold', 'firmly', 'coat', 'sleeve', 'Oh', 'must', 'n’t', 'run']"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,5,"away!” I cried with the skittish accent of an elderly dowager. “I’m sure Sir Eustace wouldn’t like you to leave me alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk about Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!” I still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start he gave. “Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables——” “Oh, Mr. Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace——” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees——” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and—er—guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply. “And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er—the Madonna—er—Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So","['away', 'I', 'cried', 'skittish', 'accent', 'elderly', 'dowager', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'would', 'n’t', 'like', 'leave', 'alone', 'one', 'talk', 'You', 'never', 'seem', 'want', 'talk', 'Florence', 'Oh', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'I', 'believe', 'guilty', 'secret', 'I', 'still', 'hand', 'arm', 'I', 'could', 'feel', 'sudden', 'start', 'gave', 'Not', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'said', 'earnestly', 'I', 'delighted', 'tell', 'really', 'cables', 'Oh', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'thin', 'pretence', 'I', 'shall', 'tell', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'got', 'He', 'gave', 'another', 'jump', 'The', 'man', '’s', 'nerves', 'seemed', 'shocking', 'state', 'What', 'want', 'know', 'The', 'resigned', 'martyrdom', 'tone', 'made', 'smile', 'inwardly', 'Oh', 'everything', 'The', 'pictures', 'olive', 'trees', 'I', 'paused', 'rather', 'loss', 'I', 'suppose', 'speak', 'Italian', 'I', 'resumed', 'Not', 'word', 'unfortunately', 'But', 'course', 'hall', 'porters', 'er', 'guides', 'Exactly', 'I', 'hastened', 'reply', 'And', 'favourite', 'picture', 'Oh', 'er', 'Madonna', 'er', 'Raphael', 'know', 'Dear', 'old', 'Florence', 'I', 'murmured', 'sentimentally', 'So']"

And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered. The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken—since you were in Florence at the time. And yet——” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where—er—where——” “—did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow. You know Marlow?

That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett. No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That—and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this.

To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence. Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester.

You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted. It was after midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam. Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream. And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger.

One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately, but I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling. My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone—a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me.

But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase—a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands.

Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected——” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr.—er—Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely. “Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once—I offer it again.

Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise. “Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain——” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in _my_ power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press—ever so little. “Like this—and squeeze the life out of you! And then—like our unconscious friend here, but with more success—fling your dead body to the sharks. What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real.

Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet. “What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her. . . .” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. _I_ could have killed her that moment,","['released', 'What', '’s', 'name', 'asked', 'abruptly', 'Anne', 'Beddingfeld', 'Does', 'nothing', 'frighten', 'Anne', 'Beddingfeld', 'Oh', 'yes', 'I', 'said', 'assumption', 'coolness', 'I', 'far', 'feeling', 'Wasps', 'sarcastic', 'women', 'young', 'men', 'cockroaches', 'superior', 'shop', 'assistants', 'He', 'gave', 'short', 'laugh', 'Then', 'stirred', 'unconscious', 'form', 'Pagett', 'feet', 'What', 'shall', 'junk', 'Throw', 'overboard', 'asked', 'carelessly', 'If', 'like', 'I', 'answered', 'equal', 'calm', 'I', 'admire', 'whole', 'hearted', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'instincts', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'But', 'leave', 'recover', 'leisure', 'He', 'seriously', 'hurt', 'You', 'shrink', 'second', 'murder', 'I', 'see', 'I', 'said', 'sweetly', 'A', 'second', 'murder', 'He', 'looked', 'genuinely', 'puzzled', 'The', 'woman', 'Marlow', 'I', 'reminded', 'watching', 'effect', 'words', 'closely', 'An', 'ugly', 'brooding', 'expression', 'settled', 'face', 'He', 'seemed', 'forgotten', 'presence', 'I', 'might', 'killed', 'said', 'Sometimes', 'I', 'believe', 'I', 'meant', 'kill', 'A', 'wild', 'rush', 'feeling', 'hatred', 'dead', 'woman', 'surged', 'I', 'could', 'killed', 'moment']"

He came nearer. “Why do you say that—au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently.

My idea was to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact.

If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So—good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps—going out of my life.

But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly.

I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum.

It was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and highly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally escorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked that. To most people it would have been a treat—but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour.

There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on. The people had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves. It was far too early to go to tea. I made for the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf board, I said “Yes, please.” Surfing looks perfectly easy. _It isn’t._ I say no more. I got very angry and fairly hurled my plank from me. Nevertheless, I determined to return on the first possible opportunity and have another go. I would not be beaten.

I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said.

I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.

It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The rest was a matter of time.

I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out. Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound—but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time.

I looked round me—and then caught my breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could.

The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it. “All bluff. They haven’t an idea where she is.” “She spoke very positively.” “I dare say. I’ve looked into the matter, and we’ve nothing to fear. Anyway, it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ orders. You don’t want to go against them, I suppose?” The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language.

But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand—though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.” He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting.","['knock', 'head', 'growled', 'It', 'would', 'simple', 'The', 'boat', 'ready', 'She', 'could', 'taken', 'sea', 'Yes', 'said', 'Chichester', 'meditatively', 'That', 'I', 'She', 'knows', 'much', 'certain', 'But', 'Colonel', 'man', 'likes', 'play', 'lone', 'hand', 'though', 'one', 'else', 'must', 'Something', 'words', 'seemed', 'awaken', 'memory', 'annoyed', 'He', 'wants', 'information', 'kind', 'girl', 'He', 'paused', 'information', 'Dutchman', 'quick', 'catch', 'Information', 'Something', 'kind', 'Diamonds', 'I', 'said', 'And', 'continued', 'Chichester', 'give', 'lists', 'For', 'long', 'time', 'conversation', 'quite', 'incomprehensible', 'It', 'seemed', 'deal', 'large', 'quantities', 'vegetables', 'Dates', 'mentioned', 'prices', 'various', 'names', 'places', 'I', 'know', 'It', 'quite', 'half', 'hour', 'finished', 'checking', 'counting']"

My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it.

I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic.

I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the _Kilmorden Castle_ was steaming out to sea.

Her voice bade me “come in.” When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck. “Anne, dear, where have you been? I’ve been worried to death about you. What have you been doing?” “Having adventures,” I replied. “Episode III of ‘The Perils of Pamela.’” I told her the whole story. She gave vent to a deep sigh when I finished. “Why do these things always happen to you?” she demanded plaintively. “Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough.

The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.” “Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again—in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne.

He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.” “I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something—even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” _“What?”_ I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again.

We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house—on purpose to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary.

How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too—just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries—unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come?

You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace.

She must have nice feet too—I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans—and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here—you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia—which is very annoying, because I _want_ to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural.

I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious.

Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically.

Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race——” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, _“Edgar_ says——” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other.

3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,10,"this is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a little—wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window. Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard.

By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I said hastily. “Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered.” To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses—going about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I inquired with some curiosity. “He’s got hold of a secretary for me. You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me.

She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi. Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I——” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed. “Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively.

He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train. And what could I do? Nothing. I saw myself, in a quarter of an hour’s time, steaming out of the station with Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu. He had turned the tables on me adroitly. His manner towards me had changed, moreover. It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat ill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite. First he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did he imagine for one minute that I hadn’t recognized him that night on the boat?

But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side—in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me.

Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy——” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.

3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,1,"I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up.

The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town. There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar.

I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew.

Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the “Colonel”! I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand and the causes underlying it—and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That was the “Colonel’s” work, his emissaries were acting according to plan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work—not the dangerous labour—for him. But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently impeccable position.

He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself—things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger!

He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at least——There I was again—dreaming! The real problem was what to do—_now!_ I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve.

If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city—with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was.

The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me.

They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other—pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that.

I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me.

I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on.

I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so.

We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban.

Then, followed by the other two, I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly.

Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech at——What’s the matter?

3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,1,"We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him—especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail. It had character. It had charm. A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged—me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each—and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy.

We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town—when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament. He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her.

It was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent—except our car which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior. By and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel Race. “There must have been giants once,” I said dreamily. “And their children were just like children are to-day—they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big—that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes.

He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do—though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength—like lions and tigers——” “And giraffes?” interpolated Colonel Race slyly. I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same—one _feels_ the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men—it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true?

The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View.

He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders.

Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand—snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid—afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are _you_ really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that—pursuing ambition.

Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked.

You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel—but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out—I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t—don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless—like I am. That’s the secret of strength—and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you.

You see—I—care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning—when I first saw you—on the _Kilmorden?”_ “No,” I whispered. “It was—since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What—what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only—that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand—and it frightened me. We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. _“Alias_ the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats—I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp.

Anne, about those diamonds——” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills.

Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home. . . . Home! And yet I had never been here before—or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely wired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We went out on the _stoep_ and I uttered a gasp. There, half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls. I’ve never seen anything so grand and beautiful—I never shall. “Anne, you’re fey,” said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. “I’ve never seen you like this before.” She stared at me curiously. “Am I?” I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. “It’s just that I love it all.” “It’s more than that.” A little frown creased her brow—one of apprehension. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something—something that would happen soon. I was excited—restless.

That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls—their elusive quality. You always think you’re going to see—and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into the","['marvellous', 'sight', 'great', 'chasm', 'rushing', 'waters', 'veil', 'mist', 'spray', 'front', 'us', 'parted', 'every', 'one', 'brief', 'minute', 'show', 'cataract', 'water', 'closed', 'impenetrable', 'mystery', 'That', 'mind', 'always', 'fascination', 'Falls', 'elusive', 'quality', 'You', 'always', 'think', '’re', 'going', 'see', 'never', 'We', 'crossed', 'bridge', 'walked', 'slowly', 'path', 'marked', 'white', 'stone', 'either', 'side', 'led', 'round', 'brink', 'gorge', 'Finally', 'arrived', 'big', 'clearing', 'left', 'path', 'led', 'downwards', 'towards', 'chasm', 'The', 'palm', 'gully', 'explained', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'Shall', 'go', 'Or', 'shall', 'leave', 'morrow', 'It', 'take', 'time', '’s', 'good', 'climb', 'We', '’ll', 'leave', 'morrow', 'said', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'decision', 'He', 'n’t', 'fond', 'strenuous', 'physical', 'exercise', 'I', 'noticed', 'He', 'led', 'way', 'back', 'As', 'went', 'passed', 'fine', 'native', 'stalking', 'along', 'Behind', 'came', 'woman', 'seemed', 'entire', 'household', 'belongings', 'piled', 'upon', 'head', 'The', 'collection', 'included', 'frying', 'pan', 'I', 'never', 'camera', 'I', 'want', 'groaned', 'Suzanne', 'That', '’s', 'opportunity', 'occur', 'often', 'enough', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'said', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'So', 'n’t', 'lament', 'We', 'arrived', 'back', 'bridge', 'Shall', 'go']"

I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren’t nearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every now and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized how enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall! We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race. Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn’t get much satisfaction. After dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. . . . There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note.

Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come. The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.” My heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known it—I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly I had come to his place of retreat. I wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be careful. He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole along to Suzanne’s room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her breathing evenly. Sir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour——” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time.

I turned and took the path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped. Something had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had followed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here, waiting. And immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of instinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was the same feeling as I had had on the _Kilmorden_ that night—a sure instinct warning me of danger. I looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or two. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my shoulder again. A man’s figure came out of the shadow. He saw that I saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track. It was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he was tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran. I heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no moon that night. And suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me laugh, an evil, sinister laugh.

I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling—falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine—a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out. Then dreams again—long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him—warn him—what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger—some great danger—and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. . . .

3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,2,"but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn.

No one shall hurt you.” He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. “Drink some of this milk.” I drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child. “Don’t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You’ll be stronger by and by. I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop!

Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do—do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.” “That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair.

What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War. Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and mostly I do as I please.” “You live here all alone?” “I am not pining for society, I assure you,” he replied coldly. “I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,” I retorted, “but I seem to have had very little to say in","['Overhanging', 'ravine', 'But', 'clothes', 'catching', 'branches', 'would', 'infallibly', 'dashed', 'pieces', 'I', 'shuddered', 'Then', 'thought', 'struck', 'You', 'say', 'n’t', 'know', 'I', 'What', 'note', 'What', 'note', 'The', 'note', 'sent', 'asking', 'meet', 'clearing', 'He', 'stared', 'I', 'sent', 'note', 'I', 'felt', 'flushing', 'roots', 'hair', 'Fortunately', 'seem', 'notice', 'How', 'come', 'spot', 'marvellous', 'manner', 'I', 'asked', 'nonchalant', 'manner', 'I', 'could', 'assume', 'And', 'part', 'world', 'anyway', 'I', 'live', 'said', 'simply', 'On', 'island', 'Yes', 'I', 'came', 'War', 'Sometimes', 'I', 'take', 'parties', 'hotel', 'boat', 'costs', 'little', 'live', 'mostly', 'I', 'I', 'please', 'You', 'live', 'alone', 'I', 'pining', 'society', 'I', 'assure', 'replied', 'coldly', 'I', 'sorry', 'inflicted', 'mine', 'upon', 'I', 'retorted', 'I', 'seem', 'little', 'say']"

Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.” “But for a different reason,” I put in. _He_ flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face was suffused. “But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless—disturbed—had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you—but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends?

The boot is on the other leg as a rule.” He spoke with a slight sneer. “Exactly,” I cried eagerly. “And that’s why there are so many unhappy marriages. It’s all the fault of the men. Either they give way to their women—and then the women despise them, or else they are utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say ‘thank you.’ Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it.

And by the time they do understand each other they aren’t in love any more.” “Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always lovers?” “I—I don’t know,” I said, momentarily confused. He turned away to the fireplace. “Like some more soup?” he asked in a casual tone. “Yes, please. I’m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.” “That’s good.” He busied himself with the fire; I watched. “When I can get off the couch, I’ll cook for you,” I promised. “I don’t suppose you know anything about cooking.” “I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,” I retorted, pointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece. _“Touché,”_ he said, and laughed.

It would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks and carried down with the torrent.” I shivered. “Once you are completely restored to health, you can journey quietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.” “That would be very tame,” I objected scornfully. “There speaks a foolish schoolgirl.” “I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.” He looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up flushed and excited. “God help me, so you are,” he muttered, and went abruptly out. My recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually broken.

I want you to hear the whole story—from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated—not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him.

I _did_ love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now—when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow——” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes—young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father.

The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life—a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track—and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend. There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken. Well, as Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find—you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you?

We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then—in the hotel at Kimberley—we met her——” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg—that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us—but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship.

Delilah—that’s what she should have been called—and she played her part well! “The De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the police came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed at first—the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were produced in court—and without question they were the stones stolen from De Beers’. Anita Grünberg had disappeared. She had effected the substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not the stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn. “Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence.

He came out furious from the interview—his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. . . . “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment—I even think that I frightened her sometimes—but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling.

At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead. All I felt was, ‘What’s the good?’ My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I was supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy—numbed of all feeling. I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect of the war. “And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention on him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost.

In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward.

He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story. It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’ Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands.

Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow.

Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House.

Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films—which I must have dropped somewhere later—and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the _Kilmorden_ Castle.

I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart—and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room—God! It was horrible. Dead—and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in.

I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country. “I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.” “Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then.

The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved. Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the _Kilmorden Castle_—that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger—hence his anxiety to get them at all costs.

Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement—or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in her own brain, and the “Colonel” was not likely to guess that they had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward!

His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too—the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage. We strained our eyes in the darkness, and could make out a dark blur on the surface of the water. It was a boat. Then there was a momentary spurt of flame. Some one had struck a match. By its light I recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at Muizenberg. The others were natives. “Quick—back to the hut.” Harry swept me back with him.

The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it.

You can’t ride in a taxi—if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat!

I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa. The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches.

I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far. “There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble.

The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley.

The respectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That’s just the kind of secret he would have—a wife and four children. “Have you told this to any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld.

Furs, curios?” “I want something quite out of the ordinary,” I said. “It’s for a special occasion. Will you show me what you’ve got?” “Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties there?” That is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so clever.

3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ I had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I got my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell. I arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He had a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. “Guns,” he answered laconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo’burg! I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting time. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building. The door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter. I stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and threw open a door. “The young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,” he said, and laughed. Thus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and smelt of cheap tobacco smoke. Behind a desk a man sat writing. He looked up and raised his eyebrows. “Dear me,” he said, “if it isn’t Miss Beddingfeld!”","['Anne', '’s', 'Narrative', 'Resumed', 'I', 'great', 'trouble', 'Suzanne', 'She', 'argued', 'pleaded', 'even', 'wept', 'would', 'let', 'carry', 'plan', 'But', 'end', 'I', 'got', 'way', 'She', 'promised', 'carry', 'instructions', 'letter', 'came', 'station', 'bid', 'tearful', 'farewell', 'I', 'arrived', 'destination', 'following', 'morning', 'early', 'I', 'met', 'short', 'black', 'bearded', 'Dutchman', 'I', 'never', 'seen', 'He', 'car', 'waiting', 'drove', 'There', 'queer', 'booming', 'distance', 'I', 'asked', 'Guns', 'answered', 'laconically', 'So', 'fighting', 'going', 'Jo’burg', 'I', 'gathered', 'objective', 'spot', 'somewhere', 'suburbs', 'city', 'We', 'turned', 'twisted', 'made', 'several', 'detours', 'get', 'every', 'minute', 'guns', 'nearer', 'It', 'exciting', 'time', 'At', 'last', 'stopped', 'somewhat', 'ramshackle', 'building', 'The', 'door', 'opened', 'Kafir', 'boy', 'My', 'guide', 'signed', 'enter', 'I', 'stood', 'irresolute', 'dingy', 'square', 'hall', 'The', 'man', 'passed', 'threw', 'open', 'door', 'The', 'young', 'lady', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Harry', 'Rayburn', 'said', 'laughed', 'Thus', 'announced', 'I', 'passed', 'The', 'room', 'sparsely', 'furnished', 'smelt', 'cheap', 'tobacco', 'smoke', 'Behind', 'desk', 'man', 'sat', 'writing', 'He', 'looked', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'Dear', 'said', 'n’t', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld']"

Really, Miss Beddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!” “It was not very bright of me,” I admitted meekly. Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him. “You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,” he remarked dryly. “Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?” I asked. “It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you—even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute. “All this is very well in its way, but we must","['I', 'must', 'seeing', 'double', 'I', 'apologized', 'Is', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'There', 'extraordinary', 'resemblance', 'Both', 'characters', 'abeyance', 'moment', 'I', 'doffed', 'petticoats', 'cloth', 'likewise', 'Wo', 'n’t', 'sit', 'I', 'accepted', 'seat', 'composedly', 'It', 'would', 'seem', 'I', 'remarked', 'I', 'come', 'wrong', 'address', 'From', 'point', 'view', 'I', 'afraid', 'Really', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'fall', 'trap', 'second', 'time', 'It', 'bright', 'I', 'admitted', 'meekly', 'Something', 'manner', 'seemed', 'puzzle', 'You', 'hardly', 'seem', 'upset', 'occurrence', 'remarked', 'dryly', 'Would', 'going', 'heroics', 'effect', 'upon', 'I', 'asked', 'It', 'certainly', 'would', 'My', 'great', 'aunt', 'Jane', 'always', 'used', 'say', 'true', 'lady', 'neither', 'shocked', 'surprised', 'anything', 'might', 'happen', 'I', 'murmured', 'dreamily', 'I', 'endeavour', 'live', 'precepts', 'I', 'read', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'Pettigrew', '’s', 'opinion', 'plainly', 'written', 'face', 'I', 'hastened', 'speech', 'You', 'really', 'positively', 'marvellous', 'make', 'I', 'said', 'generously', 'All', 'time', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'I', 'never', 'recognized', 'even', 'broke', 'pencil', 'shock', 'seeing', 'climb', 'upon', 'train', 'Cape', 'Town', 'He', 'tapped', 'upon', 'desk', 'pencil', 'holding', 'hand', 'minute', 'All', 'well', 'way', 'must']"

Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all. “I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned—a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil——” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To——” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I—I—excuse me——” He bolted from the room like a rabbit.

That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural. “Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor—but a fool.

Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple.

I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business.

I’ve got you here—I don’t want to rub it in in any way—but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you—and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself—is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes—don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much—first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night.

I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him—and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver. He must have been much the same kind of man. “Well, well,” said this extraordinary person, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn’t appeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it.

It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that—at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives. You’ve had amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs up against the professional and then the result is a foregone conclusion. I am the professional. I started on this business when I was quite a youngster. All things considered, it seemed to me a good way of getting rich quickly. I always could think things out, and devise ingenious schemes—and I never made the mistake of trying to carry out my schemes myself. Always employ the expert—that has been my motto.

Once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I’ve come to the conclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his wife and family! My fault—it tickled my sense of humour to employ the fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner’s face and his mid-Victorian soul. A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him. His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do.

What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him——” “I won’t do anything of the kind.” “Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too—on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding.

Sir Eustace stopped. “I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,” he remarked. “But be careful to make no mistakes.” “‘Yours for ever and ever, Anne,’ will be sufficient,” I remarked. I wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. “That seems all right. Now the address.” I gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew, _alias_ Minks, answered the summons. “This letter is to go immediately—the usual route.” “Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks.

What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.” “Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made—I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too—I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the _Kilmorden_—either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the _Kilmorden_ I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come.

He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking.

That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room—and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me.

Twice you have worsted me—have you never heard that the third time the luck changes? This is my round—cover him, Anne.” I was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step—and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger—don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry.

The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart.

To begin with, listen to _that!”_ _That_ was a dull banging at the door below. There were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race—and his people.

Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice.

Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach.

One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “_Quelle idée!___ You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.” “He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot.

As usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty. “It’s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer.” “And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked Poirot dryly. “But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details—all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly.

To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “_Eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other.

But _I___ should have wasted my time if _I___ had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result?

Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air. On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais.

And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville. My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know.

The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again.

Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “_Ça commence!___” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “_Mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I—” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing _sergent de ville___. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.” “But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, isn’t it?” “Yes, monsieur, but—” Poirot leaned forward. “But what?” “M.

I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?” “Yes, monsieur.” Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it. “_Voilà!___ Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate.

I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt was going to be made on his life.

The pit was freshly dug—just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead—how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants.

Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head.

Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile.

I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police—the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil—from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “_Voilà,___” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining magistrate","['evening', 'But', 'yes', 'monsieur', 'many', 'evenings', 'well', 'Who', 'Did', 'know', 'A', 'rather', 'cunning', 'look', 'spread', 'woman', '’s', 'face', 'How', 'I', 'know', 'grumbled', 'I', 'let', 'last', 'night', 'Aha', 'roared', 'examining', 'magistrate', 'bringing', 'hand', 'bang', 'table', 'You', 'would', 'trifle', 'police', 'would', 'I', 'demand', 'tell', 'name', 'woman', 'came', 'visit', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'evenings', 'The', 'police', 'police', 'grumbled', 'Françoise', 'Never', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'mixed', 'police', 'But', 'I', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'It', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'The', 'commissary', 'uttered', 'exclamation', 'leaned', 'forward', 'though', 'utter', 'astonishment', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'Villa', 'Marguerite', 'road', 'That', 'I', 'said', 'monsieur', 'Oh', 'pretty', 'one', 'cellela', 'The', 'old', 'woman', 'tossed', 'head', 'scornfully', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'murmured', 'commissary', 'Impossible', 'Voilà', 'grumbled', 'Françoise', 'That', 'get', 'telling', 'truth', 'Not', 'said', 'examining', 'magistrate']"

Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all?

There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less.

A lady _did___ come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent—one can always tell it, _n’est-ce pas?___ Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said?

He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate. It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, _voilà tout!___ So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M.

A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own.

That was laborious work, hard work—no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters.

A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically. “My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter—” “In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to the police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s life out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his friendships, and any enmities he may have incurred.

His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile.

The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “_Bien___,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M.

But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately. “They","['hand', 'prevented', 'There', 'two', 'men', 'room', 'They', 'masked', 'Can', 'describe', 'madame', 'One', 'tall', 'long', 'black', 'beard', 'short', 'stout', 'His', 'beard', 'reddish', 'They', 'wore', 'hats', 'pulled', 'eyes', 'H’m', 'said', 'magistrate', 'thoughtfully', 'much', 'beard', 'I', 'fear', 'You', 'mean', 'false', 'Yes', 'madame', 'But', 'continue', 'story', 'It', 'short', 'man', 'holding', 'He', 'forced', 'gag', 'mouth', 'bound', 'rope', 'hand', 'foot', 'The', 'man', 'standing', 'husband', 'He', 'caught', 'little', 'dagger', 'paper', 'knife', 'dressing', 'table', 'holding', 'point', 'heart', 'When', 'short', 'man', 'finished', 'joined', 'forced', 'husband', 'get', 'accompany', 'dressing', 'room', 'next', 'door', 'I', 'nearly', 'fainting', 'terror', 'nevertheless', 'I', 'listened', 'desperately', 'They']"

But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said. ‘_The secret!___ Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money.

They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes.

I had seen the change in him.” “How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman—M.

Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident—only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece.

Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “_Mon Dieu!___” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished. But Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five.

It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.”","['admitted', 'I', '’ve', 'never', 'known', 'gain', 'quite', 'much', 'With', 'gesture', 'impatience', 'magistrate', 'left', 'matter', 'watch', 'proceeded', 'interrogatory', 'Madame', 'front', 'door', 'found', 'ajar', 'It', 'seems', 'almost', 'certain', 'murderers', 'entered', 'way', 'yet', 'forced', 'Can', 'suggest', 'explanation', 'Possibly', 'husband', 'went', 'stroll', 'last', 'thing', 'forgot', 'latch', 'came', 'Is', 'likely', 'thing', 'happen', 'Very', 'My', 'husband', 'absent', 'minded', 'men', 'There', 'slight', 'frown', 'brow', 'spoke', 'though', 'trait', 'dead', 'man', '’s', 'character', 'times', 'vexed', 'There', 'one', 'inference', 'I', 'think', 'might', 'draw', 'remarked', 'commissary', 'suddenly', 'Since', 'men', 'insisted', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'dressing', 'looks', 'though', 'place', 'taking', 'place', 'secret', 'concealed', 'lay', 'distance', 'away']"

That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs","['The', 'magistrate', 'nodded', 'Yes', 'far', 'yet', 'far', 'since', 'spoke', 'back', 'morning', 'What', 'times', 'last', 'train', 'leave', 'station', 'Merlinville', 'asked', 'Poirot', 'Eleven', 'fifty', 'one', 'way', '12:17', 'probable', 'motor', 'waiting', 'Of', 'course', 'agreed', 'Poirot', 'looking', 'somewhat', 'crestfallen', 'Indeed', 'might', 'one', 'way', 'tracing', 'continued', 'magistrate', 'brightening', 'A', 'motor', 'containing', 'two', 'foreigners', 'quite', 'likely', 'noticed', 'That', 'excellent', 'point', 'M.', 'Bex', 'He', 'smiled', 'becoming', 'grave', 'said', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'There', 'another', 'question', 'Do', 'know', 'one', 'name', 'Duveen', 'Duveen', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'repeated', 'thoughtfully', 'No', 'moment', 'I', 'say', 'I', 'You', 'never', 'heard', 'husband', 'mention', 'one', 'name', 'Never', 'Do', 'know', 'one', 'whose', 'Christian', 'name', 'Bella', 'He', 'watched', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'narrowly', 'spoke', 'seeking', 'surprise', 'signs']"

He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.” “Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then—she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that—blood?” “Yes, madame.

He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow. “_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him.

It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur.

The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere.

Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him—and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you.

He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed.

I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.” I gave a gasp.

But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity.

There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.” “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile.

The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do.

Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.” “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?” The other detective stared. “Of course.” A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying. “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who used it wore gloves.

I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always _something!___ And I mean to find it.” But Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched it delicately with his finger. “And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question.

I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and, if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground. Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed. “That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish. The spade didn’t come from there, but from the toolshed up by the house.” “Marvellous,” murmured M.

Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.” Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and it vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at this juncture, he suddenly asked: “M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?” “No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course.

Poirot?” inquired Bex. “I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each hole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged mathematically. Even the greens are frequently up one side! There is only one pleasing thing—the how do you call them?—tee boxes! They, at least, are symmetrical.” I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no malice. Then he asked: “But M.

He even had a say in the designing of it.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he remarked: “It was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body? When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been discovered.” “Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that _proves___ that they were strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body there—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered.

Giraud himself had been obviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he wanted. The last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was Giraud, crawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that I could not but admire. Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically: “At last you have seen the detective you admire—the human foxhound! Is it not so, my friend?” “At any rate, he’s _doing___ something,” I said, with asperity. “If there’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you—” “_Eh bien!___ I also have found something!

And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in. For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air. “Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since they wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing?

See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little.

As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize—” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study. “You","['besides', 'keeping', 'old', 'blooms', 'well', 'picked', 'You', 'put', 'new', 'plants', 'yesterday', 'n’t', 'Those', 'middle', 'bed', 'also', 'Monsieur', 'sharp', 'eye', 'It', 'takes', 'always', 'day', 'pick', 'Yes', 'I', 'put', 'ten', 'new', 'plants', 'bed', 'last', 'night', 'As', 'Monsieur', 'doubtless', 'knows', 'one', 'put', 'plants', 'sun', 'hot', 'Auguste', 'charmed', 'Poirot', '’s', 'interest', 'quite', 'inclined', 'garrulous', 'That', 'splendid', 'specimen', 'said', 'Poirot', 'pointing', 'Might', 'I', 'perhaps', 'cutting', 'But', 'certainly', 'monsieur', 'The', 'old', 'fellow', 'stepped', 'bed', 'carefully', 'took', 'slip', 'plant', 'Poirot', 'admired', 'Poirot', 'profuse', 'thanks', 'Auguste', 'departed', 'barrow', 'You', 'see', 'said', 'Poirot', 'smile', 'bent', 'bed', 'examine', 'indentation', 'gardener', '’s', 'hobnailed', 'boot', 'It', 'quite', 'simple', 'I', 'realize', 'That', 'foot', 'would', 'inside', 'boot', 'You', 'use', 'excellent', 'mental', 'capacities', 'sufficiently', 'Well', 'footmark', 'I', 'examined', 'bed', 'carefully', 'All', 'footmarks', 'bed', 'made', 'boot', 'I', 'said', 'length', 'careful', 'study', 'You']"

He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “_Mon Dieu!___ But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, _mon ami___. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the case! That poor Giraud—I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her.

Hautet’s language. I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind. “There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks—that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville—Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely.

The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One does not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about her, you comprehend.” I nodded, my interest growing. “And—the daughter?” I ventured. “A truly beautiful young girl—modest, devout, all that she should be. One pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and then—” The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically. “But it would not be her fault!” I cried, with rising indignation. “No. But what will you?

A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a footfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my young goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her cheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with apprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid! “Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we regret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law—you comprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the goodness to grant me a few moments’ interview.” For a moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to her side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice: “I will go and see. Please come inside.” She entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur of her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil.

Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat. “I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can—er—throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame.

I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not.

He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward. Her eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult me! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations.

Hautet.” With mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards Merlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève. “The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking after them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down to the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only been here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted with M. Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the _dossier___ is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I—I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and—and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush.

She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is—any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know—but—any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. _Maman___ will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta.

Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “_Mon Dieu!___ But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when—” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you?

But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself—but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all.

Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ She will eat nothing—but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, _par exemple___, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur.

When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack—_ma foi!___ they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to run for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and his face was white—white—with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was angry!” Léonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly. “And the dispute, what was it about?” “Ah, that I do not know,” confessed Léonie. “It is true that they shouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so fast, that only one well acquainted with English could have","['angel', 'quite', 'different', 'Monsieur', 'Monsieur', 'Renauld', 'temper', 'angel', 'Far', 'When', 'enraged', 'whole', 'house', 'knew', 'The', 'day', 'quarrelled', 'M.', 'Jack—_ma', 'foi', 'might', 'heard', 'market', 'place', 'shouted', 'loud', 'Indeed', 'said', 'Poirot', 'And', 'quarrel', 'take', 'place', 'Oh', 'M.', 'Jack', 'went', 'Paris', 'Almost', 'missed', 'train', 'He', 'came', 'library', 'caught', 'bag', 'left', 'hall', 'The', 'automobile', 'repaired', 'run', 'station', 'I', 'dusting', 'salon', 'I', 'saw', 'pass', 'face', 'white', 'white', 'two', 'burning', 'spots', 'red', 'Ah', 'angry', 'Léonie', 'enjoying', 'narrative', 'thoroughly', 'And', 'dispute', 'Ah', 'I', 'know', 'confessed', 'Léonie', 'It', 'true', 'shouted', 'voices', 'loud', 'high', 'spoke', 'fast', 'one', 'well', 'acquainted', 'English', 'could']"

The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “_Quelle idée___,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the _salon___. It is cool there on this hot morning.” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind—” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least.

I turned up the path we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation. She not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an exclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella!

The young lady recovered herself first. “My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” “For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted. “When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home to England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket to and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?” I ignored the end of the speech. “When last I saw you,” I said, “you were trotting home with your sister, like a good little girl. By the way, how is your sister?” A flash of white teeth rewarded me. “How kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.” “She is here with you?” “She remained in town,” said the minx with dignity. “I don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” I laughed. “If you have, her name is Harris!” “Do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile. “Cinderella.

Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime—at the Villa Geneviève—?” She stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean—that you’re in on _that?___” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily.

What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were. Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs.

But you _will___ show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “_Please___—there’s a dear.” I capitulated.

We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the _sergent de ville___ Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again.

You will return it to me when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it.

This is going to be gruesome, you know, and—unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her.

I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.…” I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. “Take me out of here—oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. “That’s better. Oh, it was horrible!

Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that—all alone. You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road.

I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.” She flashed a smile at me. “That’s so. Au revoir, then.” “Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?” “Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow.” “I will,” I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa.

He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept?

Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence. Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “_Pardon___ M.

And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?” Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: “I know at least where they have come from.” “_Comment?___” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked.

That’s not an ordinary match—not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he _did___ light his cigarette with.

Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange.

(Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point.

Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face.

He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands.

Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request.

Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah.

I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.” “You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret.

Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily. “You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We—we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other. “I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am","['mission', 'South', 'America', 'connected', 'business', 'interests', 'As', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'paused', 'minute', 'quiet', 'voice', 'Giraud', 'broke', 'I', 'like', 'put', 'questions', 'account', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'By', 'means', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'wish', 'said', 'magistrate', 'coldly', 'Giraud', 'edged', 'chair', 'little', 'nearer', 'table', 'Were', 'good', 'terms', 'father', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'Certainly', 'I', 'returned', 'lad', 'haughtily', 'You', 'assert', 'positively', 'Yes', 'No', 'little', 'disputes', 'eh', 'Jack', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', 'Every', 'one', 'may', 'difference', 'opinion', 'Quite', 'quite', 'But', 'one', 'assert', 'violent', 'quarrel', 'father', 'eve', 'departure', 'Paris', 'person', 'without', 'doubt', 'would', 'lying', 'I', 'could', 'admire', 'ingenuity', 'Giraud', 'His', 'boast', 'I', 'know', 'everything', 'idle', 'one', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'clearly', 'disconcerted', 'question', 'We', 'argument', 'admitted', 'Ah', 'argument', 'In', 'course', 'argument', 'use', 'phrase', 'When', 'dead', 'I', 'I', 'please', 'I', 'may', 'done', 'muttered', 'I', 'n’t', 'know', 'In', 'response', 'father', 'say', 'But', 'I']"

His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things—I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious—I could almost have killed him at that moment—there, make the most of that!” He leant back in his chair, flushed and defiant. Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said: “That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast.

The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this—attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?” “I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should prefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents!” Her rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival.

I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me—especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house.

I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last.

My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective. Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so. “Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes.

Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis. “And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad—very distressing—” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean—that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was—was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it?

M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.” The commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by the hand. Poirot had risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back.

How did you get the key?” “I asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.” “And you went there? Why?” I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. “M. le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “_Eh bien!___ Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine.

It is altogether most irregular.

But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.” “That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least—” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “_Eh bien!___ I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably.

It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong, M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “_Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!___” muttered Poirot, but he said no more.

Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air.","['said', 'originality', 'The', 'case', 'clever', 'hands', 'renowned', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'He', 'without', 'doubt', 'distinguish', 'Indeed', 'I', 'wonder', 'already', 'laid', 'hands', 'upon', 'murderers', 'Madame', 'let', 'assure', 'heart', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'Messieurs', 'I', 'wish', 'good', 'day', 'And', 'accompanied', 'clerk', 'commissary', 'took', 'departure', 'Poirot', 'tugged', 'large', 'turnip', 'watch', 'observed', 'time', 'Let', 'us', 'return', 'hotel', 'lunch', 'friend', 'said', 'And', 'shall', 'recount', 'full', 'indiscretions', 'morning', 'No', 'one', 'observing', 'us', 'We', 'need', 'make', 'adieux', 'We', 'went', 'quietly', 'room', 'The', 'examining', 'magistrate', 'driven', 'car', 'I', 'going', 'steps', 'Poirot', '’s', 'voice', 'arrested', 'One', 'little', 'moment', 'friend', 'Dexterously', 'whipped', 'yard', 'measure', 'proceeded', 'quite', 'solemnly', 'measure', 'overcoat', 'hanging', 'hall', 'collar', 'hem', 'I', 'seen', 'hanging', 'guessed', 'belonged', 'either', 'Mr.', 'Stonor', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'Then', 'little', 'satisfied', 'grunt', 'Poirot', 'returned', 'measure', 'pocket', 'followed', 'open', 'air']"

I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “_After all, it does not matter—now.___” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical—significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended?

The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections. “What is it that intrigues you so?” I told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully. “You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back.

You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. _Eh bien___, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me—the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’—I had heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!___” Again that wrist watch!

You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured.

Afterwards I altered my opinion.” “What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body.

No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception—the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief.

Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “_A la bonne heure!___ Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment—possibly with the murderer—leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked.

There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat—but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of—they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No—_and there ought to have been.___ Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots—in the other, _none!___ You see?

Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, _mon ami___.” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas.

He met my eye and smiled. “But yes, it is better so. Before, there was at all events a clear theory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. Now that is all gone. We are in darkness.

Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.” But I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me. “Poirot! Mrs. Renauld! I see it now. She must be shielding somebody.” From the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see that the idea had already occurred to him. “Yes,” he said thoughtfully. “Shielding some one—or screening some one. One of the two.” I saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my theme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly non-committal attitude, repeating: “It may be—yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something very deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture.","['cover', 'tracks', 'invariably', 'betray', 'Ah', 'mon', 'ami', 'I', 'would', 'day', 'I', 'could', 'meet', 'really', 'great', 'criminal', 'one', 'commits', 'crime', 'nothing', 'Even', 'I', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'might', 'fail', 'catch', 'one', 'But', 'I', 'followed', 'words', 'A', 'light', 'burst', 'upon', 'Poirot', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'I', 'see', 'She', 'must', 'shielding', 'somebody', 'From', 'quietness', 'Poirot', 'received', 'remark', 'I', 'could', 'see', 'idea', 'already', 'occurred', 'Yes', 'said', 'thoughtfully', 'Shielding', 'one', 'screening', 'one', 'One', 'two', 'I', 'saw', 'little', 'difference', 'two', 'words', 'I', 'developed', 'theme', 'good', 'deal', 'earnestness', 'Poirot', 'maintained', 'strictly', 'non', 'committal', 'attitude', 'repeating', 'It', 'may', 'yes', 'may', 'But', 'yet', 'I', 'know', 'There', 'something', 'deep', 'underneath', 'You', 'see', 'Something', 'deep', 'Then', 'entered', 'hotel', 'enjoined', 'silence', 'gesture']"

You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance. But I was no match for Poirot.

She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well—it sounds snobbish perhaps—but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class. It never answers.” “I agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time!

I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again. I answered Poirot lightly enough. “She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan’t.” “Why ‘of course’?” “Well—I don’t want to.” “I see.” He studied me attentively for some minutes. “Yes.

Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, _mon ami___.” “You are going to Paris?

I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman.

Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her.

These fellows are so stupid. But the man continued to shake his head. “No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake—or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.” “What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot!

Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one’s friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel. Then another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship.

The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand. In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they were approaching rapidly. A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. “_Chéri___,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack—I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping.

They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear—now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid—for _you___.…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge.

Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing—listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud. “I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly. “And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.” “Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. “They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing.

Giraud subjected me to a piercing stare. “He has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,” he remarked rudely. “Good afternoon. I’m busy.” And with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony. Matters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Geneviève. Giraud evidently did not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly certain that Jack Renauld did not either. I went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the hotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement.

Another murder—and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. “What has happened?” “Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself. “Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know—me? A man—a stranger.

The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, _c’est l’Anglais!___ Enter then.

I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was neatly dressed in a dark blue suit, well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on his left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up, black and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! “I’m expecting the doctor any","['make', 'affair', 'Rather', 'stung', 'tone', 'I', 'stooped', 'head', 'passed', 'There', 'said', 'Giraud', 'flashing', 'torch', 'far', 'corner', 'I', 'stepped', 'across', 'The', 'dead', 'man', 'lay', 'straight', 'upon', 'back', 'He', 'medium', 'height', 'swarthy', 'complexion', 'possibly', 'fifty', 'years', 'age', 'He', 'neatly', 'dressed', 'dark', 'blue', 'suit', 'well', 'cut', 'probably', 'made', 'expensive', 'tailor', 'new', 'His', 'face', 'terribly', 'convulsed', 'left', 'side', 'heart', 'hilt', 'dagger', 'stood', 'black', 'shining', 'I', 'recognized', 'It', 'dagger', 'I', 'seen', 'reposing', 'glass', 'jar', 'preceding', 'morning', 'I', '’m', 'expecting', 'doctor']"

He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.” “When was it done? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel!

But see here—and here—” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people.

It was a woman’s long black hair—similar to the one Poirot had taken from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did.

She looked down at the corpse almost without interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life.

He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell.

Then she shook her head. “I do not know him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally.

I considered the face carefully. “No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.” Giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. “Same here.” He stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks.

Two pairs of old gloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them aside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over one by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head thoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten my presence. But, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old friend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M.

Giraud moved aside a little. “There in the corner. He has been stabbed to the heart, as you see. And with the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. I fancy that the murder followed hard upon the theft—but that is for you to say.

Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have been stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand asserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours! The whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme. We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s announcement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28.

The quickness of his return proved that. Very few hours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I had to impart. The train was some minutes late, and I strolled aimlessly up and down the platform, until it occurred to me that I might pass the time by asking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train on the evening of the tragedy. I approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had little difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject.

He would have noticed two foreigners—he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head—possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones—but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld—he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me.

Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform.","['11:40', 'My', 'brain', 'whirled', 'That', 'reason', 'Marthe', '’s', 'poignant', 'anxiety', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'Merlinville', 'night', 'crime', 'But', 'said', 'Why', 'contrary', 'led', 'us', 'believe', 'remained', 'Cherbourg', 'Remembering', 'frank', 'boyish', 'countenance', 'I', 'could', 'hardly', 'bring', 'believe', 'connection', 'crime', 'Yet', 'silence', 'part', 'vital', 'matter', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'Marthe', 'known', 'along', 'Hence', 'anxiety', 'eager', 'questioning', 'Poirot', 'know', 'whether', 'one', 'suspected', 'My', 'cogitations', 'interrupted', 'arrival', 'train', 'another', 'moment', 'I', 'greeting', 'Poirot', 'The', 'little', 'man', 'radiant', 'He', 'beamed', 'vociferated', 'forgetting', 'English', 'reluctance', 'embraced', 'warmly', 'platform']"

His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M.

If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew.

It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made.

Equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___ mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud.

The boots he subjected to special care, also the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at Giraud. “You saw these?” “Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable. Suddenly Poirot stiffened. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor came forward. “There is foam on the lips. You observed it?” “I didn’t notice it, I must admit.” “But you observe it now?” “Oh, certainly.” Poirot again shot a question at Giraud. “You noticed it without doubt?” The other did not reply.

It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance.

Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil—Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld.

Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.” “Of that crime, perhaps. But not of this.” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M.

The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the _crime passionnel___ is one.

And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance.

You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast. “Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This.

There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently. “You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets.

We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also.

The sea was of the palest blue, and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my own good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then.

I say we—although I dare say _I___ would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss.

But at last I collected my thoughts and went on. “Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to believe that he is dead.” “_Aucunement___,” agreed Poirot. “Proceed.” “Therefore we will assume that he is alive.” “Exactly.” “Or that he was alive until recently.” “_De mieux en mieux!___” “We will presume,” I continued, my enthusiasm rising, “that he has fallen on evil days.

Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it likely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and Conneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there suddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to appear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful consequences to her daughter if this scandal of the past is revived. His father’s murderer is dead—let them do their best to hush it up. Jack Renauld consents—goes to the house and has an interview with his mother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound.

What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats—eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings.

Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated.

At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch. All is well—the sea it will be calm!” In the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on board the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself together, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose?

The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much. What kept her there—the hope of seeing Jack Renauld?

If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause.

But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, _mon ami___. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it.

What’s her line?” “That I do not know—but here is her photograph.” Mr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted. “Got it!” He slapped his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “That’s it. They’re sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite a good little turn. They’re in the provinces somewhere, I believe—if they’re not resting. They’ve been on in Paris for the last two or three weeks.” “Can you find out for me exactly where they are?” “Easy as a bird. You go home, and I’ll send you round the dope in the morning.” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry.

I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here—in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the—the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything—understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last","['must', 'get', 'air', 'I', 'suggested', 'leaving', 'Poirot', 'Go', 'means', 'mon', 'ami', 'I', 'amuse', 'stay', 'end', 'I', 'rejoin', 'later', 'It', 'steps', 'theatre', 'hotel', 'I', 'went', 'sitting', 'room', 'ordered', 'whisky', 'soda', 'sat', 'drinking', 'staring', 'meditatively', 'empty', 'grate', 'I', 'heard', 'door', 'open', 'turned', 'head', 'thinking', 'Poirot', 'Then', 'I', 'jumped', 'feet', 'It', 'Cinderella', 'stood', 'doorway', 'She', 'spoke', 'haltingly', 'breath', 'coming', 'little', 'gasps', 'I', 'saw', 'front', 'You', 'friend', 'When', 'got', 'go', 'I', 'waiting', 'outside', 'followed', 'Why', 'Coventry', 'What', 'night', 'Is', 'man', 'detective', 'She', 'stood', 'cloak', 'wrapped', 'round', 'stage', 'dress', 'slipping', 'shoulders', 'I', 'saw', 'whiteness', 'cheeks', 'rouge', 'heard', 'terror', 'voice', 'And', 'moment', 'I', 'understood', 'everything', 'understood', 'Poirot', 'seeking', 'feared', 'understood', 'last']"

Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know—I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been—rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time.

She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to—to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love—and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t—you can’t—not if you knew—” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night.

Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly—but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links—” Again I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you—but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him.

But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that—a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know—ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do.

For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true—but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief.

I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “_Mon ami___,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “_Mon Dieu!___ no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! _Eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend?

And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _Eh bien!___ it comes to this—are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not?

I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea—had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened.","['After', 'moment', 'stress', 'I', 'described', 'reaction', 'bound', 'set', 'I', 'retired', 'rest', 'night', 'note', 'triumph', 'I', 'awoke', 'realize', 'I', 'means', 'wood', 'True', 'I', 'could', 'see', 'flaw', 'alibi', 'I', 'suddenly', 'conceived', 'I', 'stick', 'story', 'I', 'failed', 'see', 'Bella', 'could', 'convicted', 'face', 'It', 'though', 'old', 'friendship', 'us', 'could', 'raked', 'might', 'lead', 'suspect', 'I', 'committing', 'perjury', 'It', 'could', 'proved', 'actual', 'fact', 'I', 'seen', 'girl', 'three', 'occasions', 'No', 'I', 'still', 'satisfied', 'idea', 'even', 'Poirot', 'admitted', 'defeated', 'But', 'I', 'felt', 'need', 'treading', 'warily', 'All', 'well', 'little', 'friend', 'admit', 'momentarily', 'nonplussed', 'I', 'far', 'much', 'respect', 'abilities', 'conceive', 'content', 'remain', 'position', 'I', 'humble', 'opinion', 'wits', 'came', 'matching', 'Poirot', 'would', 'take', 'defeat', 'lying', 'Somehow', 'would', 'endeavour', 'turn', 'tables', 'way', 'moment', 'I', 'least', 'expected', 'We', 'met', 'breakfast', 'following', 'morning', 'though', 'nothing', 'happened']"

After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely.

I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well—something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No—let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act—but I could not rest easy in my mind. Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what your","['track', 'Clearly', 'course', 'disappear', 'utterly', 'time', 'But', 'meantime', 'Poirot', 'I', 'studied', 'attentively', 'He', 'wearing', 'innocent', 'air', 'staring', 'meditatively', 'far', 'distance', 'He', 'looked', 'altogether', 'placid', 'supine', 'give', 'reassurance', 'I', 'learned', 'Poirot', 'less', 'dangerous', 'looked', 'dangerous', 'His', 'quiescence', 'alarmed', 'Observing', 'troubled', 'quality', 'glance', 'smiled', 'benignantly', 'You', 'puzzled', 'Hastings', 'You', 'ask', 'I', 'launch', 'pursuit', 'Well', 'something', 'kind', 'It', 'would', 'place', 'I', 'understand', 'But', 'I', 'enjoy', 'rushing', 'country', 'seeking', 'needle', 'haystack', 'English', 'say', 'No', 'let', 'Mademoiselle', 'Bella', 'Duveen', 'go', 'Without', 'doubt', 'I', 'shall', 'able', 'find', 'time', 'comes', 'Until', 'I', 'content', 'wait', 'I', 'stared', 'doubtfully', 'Was', 'seeking', 'mislead', 'I', 'irritating', 'feeling', 'even', 'master', 'situation', 'My', 'sense', 'superiority', 'gradually', 'waning', 'I', 'contrived', 'girl', '’s', 'escape', 'evolved', 'brilliant', 'scheme', 'saving', 'consequences', 'rash', 'act', 'I', 'could', 'rest', 'easy', 'mind', 'Poirot', '’s', 'perfect', 'calm', 'awakened', 'thousand', 'apprehensions', 'I', 'suppose', 'Poirot', 'I', 'said', 'rather', 'diffidently', 'I', 'must', 'n’t', 'ask']"

We return to France without delay.” “_We?___” “Precisely—‘_we!___’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish—” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard—which every one would perceive, _bien entendu___—I much prefer that we should voyage together. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you—” “I know—I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples","['plans', 'I', '’ve', 'forfeited', 'right', 'But', 'There', 'secret', 'We', 'return', 'France', 'without', 'delay', 'We', 'Precisely—‘_we', 'You', 'know', 'well', 'afford', 'let', 'Papa', 'Poirot', 'sight', 'Eh', 'friend', 'But', 'remain', 'England', 'means', 'wish', 'I', 'shook', 'head', 'He', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'I', 'could', 'afford', 'let', 'sight', 'Although', 'I', 'could', 'expect', 'confidence', 'happened', 'I', 'could', 'still', 'check', 'actions', 'The', 'danger', 'Bella', 'lay', 'Giraud', 'French', 'police', 'indifferent', 'existence', 'At', 'costs', 'I', 'must', 'keep', 'near', 'Poirot', 'Poirot', 'observed', 'attentively', 'reflections', 'passed', 'mind', 'gave', 'nod', 'satisfaction', 'I', 'right', 'I', 'And', 'quite', 'capable', 'trying', 'follow', 'disguised', 'absurdity', 'false', 'beard', 'every', 'one', 'would', 'perceive', 'bien', 'entendu___—I', 'much', 'prefer', 'voyage', 'together', 'It', 'would', 'annoy', 'greatly', 'one', 'mock', 'Very', 'well', 'But', '’s', 'fair', 'warn', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'know', 'You', 'enemy', 'Be', 'enemy', 'It', 'worry', 'So', 'long', '’s', 'fair', 'board', 'I', 'n’t', 'mind', 'You', 'full', 'English', 'passion', 'fair', 'play', 'Now', 'scruples']"

I know—what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still—” I began, and stopped. “Still—as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella—yes, but in doing so I ran the risk of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience—horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover","['satisfied', 'let', 'us', 'depart', 'immediately', 'There', 'time', 'lost', 'Our', 'stay', 'England', 'short', 'sufficient', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'wanted', 'know', 'The', 'tone', 'light', 'I', 'read', 'veiled', 'menace', 'words', 'Still', 'I', 'began', 'stopped', 'Still', 'say', 'Without', 'doubt', 'satisfied', 'part', 'playing', 'Me', 'I', 'preoccupy', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'The', 'words', 'gave', 'start', 'I', 'completely', 'forgotten', 'aspect', 'case', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'prison', 'shadow', 'guillotine', 'looming', 'I', 'saw', 'part', 'I', 'playing', 'sinister', 'light', 'I', 'could', 'save', 'Bella', 'yes', 'I', 'ran', 'risk', 'sending', 'innocent', 'man', 'death', 'I', 'pushed', 'thought', 'horror', 'It', 'could', 'He', 'would', 'acquitted', 'Certainly', 'would', 'acquitted', 'But', 'cold', 'fear', 'came', 'back', 'Suppose', 'What', 'Could', 'I', 'conscience', 'horrible', 'thought', 'Would', 'come', 'end', 'A', 'decision', 'Bella', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'The', 'promptings', 'heart', 'save', 'girl', 'I', 'loved', 'cost', 'But', 'cost', 'another', 'problem', 'altered', 'What', 'would', 'girl', 'say', 'I', 'remembered', 'word', 'Jack', 'Renauld', '’s', 'arrest', 'passed', 'lips', 'As', 'yet', 'total', 'ignorance', 'fact', 'former', 'lover']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,6,"was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,7,"still remained a cold fear. 24 “Save Him!” We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did—eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “_Eh bien___, speaking frankly—in confidence, _c’est entendu___—can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as—?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making.

By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with _empressement___. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much. The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all—no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive,","['guilty', 'hideous', 'crime', 'By', 'way', 'say', 'matter', 'The', 'magistrate', 'frowned', 'I', 'understand', 'He', 'seems', 'incapable', 'putting', 'sort', 'defence', 'It', 'difficult', 'get', 'answer', 'questions', 'He', 'contents', 'general', 'denial', 'beyond', 'takes', 'refuge', 'obstinate', 'silence', 'I', 'interrogating', 'tomorrow', 'perhaps', 'would', 'like', 'present', 'We', 'accepted', 'invitation', 'empressement', 'A', 'distressing', 'case', 'said', 'magistrate', 'sigh', 'My', 'sympathy', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'profound', 'How', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'She', 'yet', 'recovered', 'consciousness', 'It', 'merciful', 'way', 'poor', 'woman', 'spared', 'much', 'The', 'doctors', 'say', 'danger', 'comes', 'must', 'kept', 'quiet', 'possible', 'It', 'I', 'understand', 'quite', 'much', 'shock', 'fall', 'caused', 'present', 'state', 'It', 'would', 'terrible', 'brain', 'became', 'unhinged', 'I', 'wonder', 'really', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'leaned', 'back', 'shaking', 'head', 'sort', 'mournful', 'enjoyment', 'envisaged', 'gloomy', 'prospect', 'He', 'roused', 'length', 'observed', 'start', 'That', 'reminds', 'I', 'letter', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'Let', 'see', 'I', 'put', 'He', 'proceeded', 'rummage', 'amongst', 'papers', 'At', 'last', 'found', 'missive']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,9,"and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “_A demain___ then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike—rude, sneering fellows. They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my—er—experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain—_flair___. _Enfin!___ the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I—eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M.

His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “_Pardon!___ But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment—then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “_Toqué!___” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “_Toqué!___” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy—you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree!

I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal—no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely.

Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he _wanted___ to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger—” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs.","['What', '’s', 'opinion', 'monsieur', 'I', 'think', 'things', 'look', 'black', 'said', 'Poirot', 'quietly', 'You', 'believe', 'guilty', 'said', 'Stonor', 'sharply', 'No', 'But', 'I', 'think', 'find', 'hard', 'prove', 'innocence', 'He', '’s', 'behaving', 'damned', 'queerly', 'muttered', 'Stonor', 'Of', 'course', 'I', 'realize', '’s', 'lot', 'affair', 'meets', 'eye', 'Giraud', '’s', 'wise', '’s', 'outsider', 'whole', 'thing', 'damned', 'odd', 'As', 'least', 'said', 'soonest', 'mended', 'If', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'wants', 'hush', 'anything', 'I', '’ll', 'take', 'cue', 'It', '’s', 'show', 'I', '’ve', 'much', 'respect', 'judgment', 'shove', 'oar', 'I', 'ca', 'n’t', 'get', 'behind', 'attitude', 'Jack', '’s', 'Any', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'wanted', 'thought', 'guilty', 'But', '’s', 'absurd', 'I', 'cried', 'bursting', 'For', 'one', 'thing', 'dagger', 'I', 'paused', 'uncertain', 'much', 'Poirot', 'would', 'wish', 'reveal', 'I', 'continued', 'choosing', 'words', 'carefully', 'We', 'know', 'dagger', 'could', 'Jack', 'Renauld', '’s', 'possession', 'evening', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'knows', 'True', 'said', 'Stonor', 'When', 'recovers', 'doubtless', 'say', 'Well', 'I', 'must', 'leaving', 'One', 'moment', 'Poirot', '’s', 'hand', 'arrested', 'departure', 'Can', 'arrange', 'word', 'sent', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'recover', 'consciousness', 'Certainly', 'That', '’s', 'easily', 'done', 'That', 'point', 'dagger', 'good', 'Poirot', 'I', 'urged', 'went', 'upstairs']"

It was not very difficult. _Eh bien___, Hastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but _three___.” “So that—?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively.

Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come—it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even. I suffer horribly, I am nearly mad. Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother?

Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded—totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain.

Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an equally excellent _entrecôte___ to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length _café noir___ had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little _salon___.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say—” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.

Poirot cleared his throat. “_Mes enfants___,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start—for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “_Très bien, mon enfant___,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle—” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève.

Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same, but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping—that is the great thing. _Maman___ made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs.

She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.” “By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why—” I began. “No ‘_whys___,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève.

The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But—” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the—” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “_Mille tonnerres!___” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of","['Geneviève', 'Poirot', 'took', 'stand', 'behind', 'bushes', 'left', 'drive', 'whilst', 'enjoying', 'good', 'view', 'completely', 'hidden', 'sight', 'The', 'Villa', 'total', 'darkness', 'everybody', 'without', 'doubt', 'bed', 'asleep', 'We', 'almost', 'immediately', 'window', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', '’s', 'bedroom', 'window', 'I', 'noticed', 'open', 'It', 'seemed', 'upon', 'spot', 'Poirot', '’s', 'eyes', 'fixed', 'What', 'going', 'I', 'whispered', 'Watch', 'But', 'I', 'expect', 'anything', 'happen', 'least', 'hour', 'probably', 'two', 'hours', 'But', 'words', 'interrupted', 'long', 'thin', 'drawn', 'cry', 'Help', 'A', 'light', 'flashed', 'second', 'floor', 'room', 'right', 'hand', 'side', 'house', 'The', 'cry', 'came', 'And', 'even', 'watched', 'came', 'shadow', 'blind', 'two', 'people', 'struggling', 'Mille', 'tonnerres', 'cried', 'Poirot', 'She', 'must', 'changed', 'room', 'Dashing', 'forward', 'battered', 'wildly', 'front', 'door', 'Then', 'rushing', 'tree', 'flower', 'bed', 'swarmed', 'agility', 'cat', 'I', 'followed', 'bound', 'sprang', 'open', 'window', 'Looking', 'shoulder', 'I', 'saw', 'Dulcie', 'reaching', 'branch', 'behind', 'Take', 'care', 'I', 'exclaimed', 'Take', 'care']"

I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t!

Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is—the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings.

He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you _must___ have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room—her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations—they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you—why—was—I—not—told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress.

I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a _garde-malad___.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel.

They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans.

From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife. So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape.

If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper—which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him. But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth—not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death—she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality.

Renauld’s plans. “(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have killed M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because, as I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel.

There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her.

He has been obliged to return to Paris.” We both smiled. Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame!

Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot’s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. “_Mais, oui!___ I got my 500 francs!

I dare say I am wrong."" ""No,"" said Ruth, ""you are not wrong."" She had suddenly become very grave. ""I wish you would tell me what other impressions you formed about me?"" ""I--"" Ruth swept on disregarding the other's embarrassment. ""Oh, please, don't be conventional. I want to know.

They were just finishing their lunch. Ruth gulped down her coffee, rose from her seat, and quite oblivious of the fact that Katherine had not begun to sip her coffee, said: ""Come to my compartment with me."" They were two single compartments with a communicating door between them. In the second of them a thin maid, whom Katherine had noticed at Victoria, was sitting very upright on the seat, clutching a big scarlet morocco case with the initials R. V. K. on it. Mrs. Kettering pulled the communicating door to and sank down on the seat. Katherine sat down beside her. ""I am in trouble and I don't know what to do.

I suppose, really, I just needed some one to talk to. I can't think now why I have been making such an absolute fool of myself."" Katherine got up too.

She added tactfully: ""I must be going back to my own compartment."" She emerged into the corridor at the same time as the maid was also coming out from the next door. The latter looked towards Katherine, over her shoulder, and an expression of intense surprise showed itself on her face.

As she passed the end compartment the door opened and a woman's face looked out for a moment and then pulled the door to sharply. It was a face not easily forgotten, as Katherine was to know when she saw it again. A beautiful face, oval and dark, very heavily made up in a bizarre fashion. Katherine had a feeling that she had seen it before somewhere. She regained her own compartment without other adventure and sat for some time thinking of the confidence which had just been made to her. She wondered idly who the woman in the mink coat might be, wondered also how the end of her story would turn out. ""If I have stopped any one from making an idiot of themselves, I suppose I have done good work,"" she thought to herself. ""But who knows? That is the kind of woman who is hard-headed and egotistical all her life, and it might be good for her to do the other sort of thing for a change.

They had reached Paris, and the slow journey round the _ceinture_, with its interminable stops and waits, was very wearisome. When they arrived at the Gare de Lyon she was glad to get out and walk up and down the platform. The keen cold air was refreshing after the steam-heated train. She observed with a smile that her friend of the mink coat was solving the possible awkwardness of the dinner problem in her own way. A dinner basket was being handed up and received through the window by the maid. When the train started once more, and dinner was announced by a violent ringing of bells, Katherine went along to it much relieved in mind. Her _vis-à-vis_ to-night was of an entirely different kind--a small man, distinctly foreign in appearance, with a rigidly waxed moustache and an egg-shaped head which he carried rather on one side. Katherine had taken in a book to dinner with her. She found the little man's eyes fixed upon it with a kind of twinkling amusement. ""I see, Madame, that you have a _roman policier_. You are fond of such things?"" ""They amuse me,"" Katherine admitted. The little man nodded with the air of complete understanding.

""Of course, one knows that such things don't really happen,"" Katherine was continuing, but he interrupted her sharply. ""Sometimes, Mademoiselle! Sometimes!

Good-night, Mademoiselle, and may you sleep well."" Katherine went back along the train amused and entertained by her little neighbour. She passed the open door of her friend's compartment and saw the conductor making up the bed. The lady in the mink coat was standing looking out of the window. The second compartment, as Katherine saw through the communicating door, was empty, with rugs and bags heaped up on the seat. The maid was not there. Katherine found her own bed prepared, and since she was tired, she went to bed and switched off her light about half-past nine. She woke with a sudden start; how much time had passed she did not know. Glancing at her watch, she found that it had stopped. A feeling of intense uneasiness pervaded her and grew stronger moment by moment. At last she got up, threw her dressing-gown round her shoulders, and stepped out into the corridor. The whole train seemed wrapped in slumber. Katherine let down the window and sat by it for some minutes, drinking in the cool night air and trying vainly to calm her uneasy fears.

She hesitated for a moment and then walked through into the next coach. She looked down the long, dim line of the corridor and saw, to her surprise, that a man was standing with his hand on the door of the compartment occupied by the lady in the mink coat. That is to say, she thought it was the compartment. Probably, however, she was mistaken. He stood there for a moment or two with his back to her, seeming uncertain and hesitating in his attitude. Then he slowly turned, and with an odd feeling of fatality, Katherine recognized him as the same man whom she had noticed twice before--once in the corridor of the Savoy hotel and once in Cook's offices. Then he opened the door of the compartment and passed in, drawing it to behind him. An idea flashed across Katherine's mind. Could this be the man of whom the other woman had spoken--the man she was journeying to meet. Then Katherine told herself that she was romancing. In all probability she had mistaken the compartment. She went back to her own carriage. Five minutes later the train slackened speed. There was the long plaintive hiss of the Westinghouse brake, and a few minutes later the train came to a stop at Lyons.","['could', 'set', 'watch', 'She', 'found', 'however', 'little', 'chair', 'vacant', 'She', 'hesitated', 'moment', 'walked', 'next', 'coach', 'She', 'looked', 'long', 'dim', 'line', 'corridor', 'saw', 'surprise', 'man', 'standing', 'hand', 'door', 'compartment', 'occupied', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'That', 'say', 'thought', 'compartment', 'Probably', 'however', 'mistaken', 'He', 'stood', 'moment', 'two', 'back', 'seeming', 'uncertain', 'hesitating', 'attitude', 'Then', 'slowly', 'turned', 'odd', 'feeling', 'fatality', 'Katherine', 'recognized', 'man', 'noticed', 'twice', '--', 'corridor', 'Savoy', 'hotel', 'Cook', ""'s"", 'offices', 'Then', 'opened', 'door', 'compartment', 'passed', 'drawing', 'behind', 'An', 'idea', 'flashed', 'across', 'Katherine', ""'s"", 'mind', 'Could', 'man', 'woman', 'spoken', '--', 'man', 'journeying', 'meet', 'Then', 'Katherine', 'told', 'romancing', 'In', 'probability', 'mistaken', 'compartment', 'She', 'went', 'back', 'carriage', 'Five', 'minutes', 'later', 'train', 'slackened', 'speed', 'There', 'long', 'plaintive', 'hiss', 'Westinghouse', 'brake', 'minutes', 'later', 'train', 'came', 'stop', 'Lyons']"

When she returned to her compartment it had just been restored to its day-time appearance by the conductor, a dark man with a drooping moustache and melancholy face. ""Madame is fortunate,"" he said; ""the sun shines. It is always a great disappointment to passengers when they arrive on a grey morning."" ""I should have been disappointed, certainly,"" said Katherine. The man prepared to depart. ""We are rather late, Madame,"" he said. ""I will let you know just before we get to Nice."" Katherine nodded. She sat by the window, entranced by the sunlit panorama. The palm trees, the deep blue of the sea, the bright yellow mimosa came with all the charm of novelty to the woman who for fourteen years had known only the drab winters of England. When they arrived at Cannes, Katherine got out and walked up and down the platform. She was curious about the lady in the mink coat, and looked up at the windows of her compartment. The blinds were still drawn down--the only ones to be so on the whole train.

Presently the conductor came to her and told her that in a few minutes the train would arrive at Nice. Katherine handed him a tip; the man thanked her, but still lingered. There was something odd about him. Katherine, who had at first wondered whether the tip had not been big enough, was now convinced that something far more serious was amiss. His face was of a sickly pallor, he was shaking all over, and looked as if he had been frightened out of his life. He was eyeing her in a curious manner. Presently he said abruptly: ""Madame will excuse me, but is she expecting friends to meet her at Nice?"" ""Probably,"" said Katherine. ""Why?"" But the man merely shook his head and murmured something that Katherine could not catch and moved away, not reappearing until the train came to rest at the station, when he started handing her belongings down from the window. Katherine stood for a moment or two on the platform rather at a loss, but a fair young man with an ingenuous face came up to her and said rather hesitatingly: ""Miss Grey, is it not?"" Katherine said that it was, and the young man beamed upon her seraphically and murmured: ""I am Chubby, you know--Lady","['shuttered', 'closed', 'The', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'clearly', 'early', 'riser', 'Presently', 'conductor', 'came', 'told', 'minutes', 'train', 'would', 'arrive', 'Nice', 'Katherine', 'handed', 'tip', 'man', 'thanked', 'still', 'lingered', 'There', 'something', 'odd', 'Katherine', 'first', 'wondered', 'whether', 'tip', 'big', 'enough', 'convinced', 'something', 'far', 'serious', 'amiss', 'His', 'face', 'sickly', 'pallor', 'shaking', 'looked', 'frightened', 'life', 'He', 'eyeing', 'curious', 'manner', 'Presently', 'said', 'abruptly', 'Madame', 'excuse', 'expecting', 'friends', 'meet', 'Nice', 'Probably', 'said', 'Katherine', 'Why', 'But', 'man', 'merely', 'shook', 'head', 'murmured', 'something', 'Katherine', 'could', 'catch', 'moved', 'away', 'reappearing', 'train', 'came', 'rest', 'station', 'started', 'handing', 'belongings', 'window', 'Katherine', 'stood', 'moment', 'two', 'platform', 'rather', 'loss', 'fair', 'young', 'man', 'ingenuous', 'face', 'came', 'said', 'rather', 'hesitatingly', 'Miss', 'Grey', 'Katherine', 'said', 'young', 'man', 'beamed', 'upon', 'seraphically', 'murmured', 'I', 'Chubby', 'know', '--', 'Lady']"

I lost mine when I came out this year, and you would not believe the fuss they made about it. Regular French red tape!"" Katherine produced it, and was just about to move off beside him when a very gentle and insidious voice murmured in her ear: ""A little moment, Madame, if you please."" Katherine turned to behold an individual who made up for insignificance of stature by a large quantity of gold lace and uniform. The individual explained. ""There were certain formalities. Madame would perhaps be so kind as to accompany him. The regulations of the police--"" He threw up his arms. ""Absurd, doubtless, but there it was."" Mr. Chubby Evans listened with a very imperfect comprehension, his French being of a limited order. ""So like the French,"" murmured Mr. Evans. He was one of those staunch patriotic Britons who, having made a portion of a foreign country their own, strongly resent the original inhabitants of it. ""Always up to some silly dodge or other.

In it was a pompous-looking official personage, and with him a nondescript being who appeared to be a clerk. The pompous-looking personage rose politely, bowed to Katherine, and said: ""You will excuse me, Madame, but there are certain formalities to be complied with. Madame speaks French, I trust?"" ""Sufficiently, I think, Monsieur,"" replied Katherine in that language. ""That is good. Pray be seated, Madame. I am M. Caux, the Commissary of Police."" He blew out his chest importantly, and Katherine tried to look sufficiently impressed. ""You wish to see my passport?"" she inquired. ""Here it is."" The Commissary eyed her keenly and gave a little grunt. ""Thank you, Madame,"" he said, taking the passport from her. He cleared his throat. ""But what I really desire is a little information."" ""Information?"" The Commissary nodded his head slowly. ""About a lady who has been a fellow-passenger of yours. You lunched with her yesterday."" ""I am afraid I can't tell you anything about her.

""I could,"" said Katherine, ""but at the moment I see no reason to do so."" In somewhat British fashion she felt annoyed. This foreign official seemed to her impertinent.

The egg-shaped head of Katherine's dinner acquaintance showed itself in the aperture. On his face was a beaming smile. ""My name,"" he said, ""is Hercule Poirot.""

The dead woman lay on the berth to their left, in so natural a posture that one could have thought her asleep. The bedclothes were drawn up over her, and her head was turned to the wall, so that only the red auburn curls showed. Very gently M.

""Be brave, Mademoiselle; look at her well. Are you sure that this is the woman you talked to in the train yesterday?"" Katherine had good nerves. She steeled herself to look long and earnestly at the recumbent figure. Then she leaned forward and took up the dead woman's hand. ""I am quite sure,"" she replied at length.

The other, and the more likely to my mind, is that her assailant was a train robber travelling on the train; that he stole along the corridor unseen by the conductor, killed her, and went off with the red morocco case, which doubtless contained jewels of some value.

Everything goes on much the same here. There was great trouble about the new curate, who is scandalously high. In my view, he is neither more nor less than a Roman. Everybody has spoken to the Vicar about it, but you know what the Vicar is--all Christian charity and no proper spirit. I have had a lot of trouble with maids lately. That girl Annie was no good--skirts up to her knees and wouldn't wear sensible woollen stockings. Not one of them can bear being spoken to. I have had a lot of pain with my rheumatism one way and another, and Dr. Harris persuaded me to go and see a London specialist--a waste of three guineas and a railway fare, as I told him; but by waiting until Wednesday I managed to get a cheap return.
