The bank—I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one.

He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later.","['muffler', 'it', '’', 'cold', 'day', 'in', 'minute', 'Papa', 'stalk', 'correctly', 'boot', 'well', 'mufflere', 'he', 'return', 'late', 'evening', 'dismay', 'I', 'see', 'muffler', 'overcoat', 'miss', 'dear', 'Anne', 'quite', 'right', 'I', 'take', 'go', 'cavern', 'one', 'get', 'dirty', 'I', 'nod', 'feelingly', 'remember', 'occasion', 'Papa', 'return', 'literally', 'plaster', 'head', 'foot', 'rich', 'Pleiocene', 'clay', 'our', 'principal', 'reason', 'settle', 'Little', 'Hampsly', 'neighbourhood', 'Hampsly', 'Cavern', 'buried', 'cave', 'rich', 'deposit', 'aurignacian', 'culture', 'we', 'tiny', 'Museum', 'village', 'curator', 'Papa', 'spend', 'day', 'mess', 'underground', 'bring', 'light', 'portion', 'woolly', 'rhinoceros', 'cave', 'bear', 'Papa', 'cough', 'badly', 'evening', 'follow', 'morning', 'I', 'see', 'temperature', 'send', 'doctor', 'poor', 'Papa', 'never', 'chance', 'it', 'double', 'pneumonia', 'he', 'die', 'four', 'day', 'later']"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,1,"Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for—freedom—was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people.","['every', 'one', 'kind', 'daze', 'I', 'I', 'appreciate', 'I', 'feel', 'overwhelming', 'grief', 'Papa', 'never', 'love', 'I', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'if', 'I', 'might', 'love', 'return', 'no', 'love', 'we', 'belong', 'together', 'I', 'look', 'secretly', 'admire', 'learning', 'uncompromise', 'devotion', 'science', 'and', 'hurt', 'Papa', 'die', 'interest', 'life', 'height', 'I', 'feel', 'happy', 'I', 'could', 'bury', 'cave', 'painting', 'reindeer', 'flint', 'implement', 'force', 'public', 'opinion', 'constrain', 'neat', 'tomb', 'marble', 'slab', 'hideous', 'local', 'churchyard', 'the', 'vicar', '’s', 'consolation', 'though', 'well', 'mean', 'console', 'least', 'it', 'take', 'time', 'dawn', 'upon', 'thing', 'I', 'always', 'long', 'freedom', 'last', 'mine', 'I', 'orphan', 'practically', 'penniless', 'free', 'at', 'time', 'I', 'realize', 'extraordinary', 'kindness', 'good', 'people']"

Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner.

An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant, kind and fatherly—and without the least doubt he regarded me as a perfect fool of a girl left adrift to face an unkind world. From the first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary. As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well I didn’t. “My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?” “Oh, yes.” “Your father, as you know,","['hear', 'next', 'China', 'timbuctoo', 'my', 'next', 'visitor', 'Mr.', 'Flemming', 'Papa', '’s', 'London', 'solicitor', 'he', 'come', 'specially', 'town', 'see', 'an', 'ardent', 'anthropologist', 'great', 'admirer', 'Papa', '’s', 'work', 'he', 'tall', 'spare', 'man', 'thin', 'face', 'grey', 'hair', 'he', 'rise', 'meet', 'I', 'enter', 'room', 'take', 'hand', 'pat', 'affectionately', 'my', 'poor', 'child', 'say', 'my', 'poor', 'poor', 'child', 'without', 'conscious', 'hypocrisy', 'I', 'find', 'assume', 'demeanour', 'bereaved', 'orphan', 'he', 'hypnotize', 'he', 'benignant', 'kind', 'fatherly', 'without', 'least', 'doubt', 'regard', 'perfect', 'fool', 'girl', 'leave', 'adrift', 'face', 'unkind', 'world', 'from', 'first', 'I', 'feel', 'quite', 'useless', 'try', 'convince', 'contrary', 'as', 'thing', 'turn', 'perhaps', 'well', 'I', 'n’t', 'my', 'dear', 'child', 'think', 'listen', 'whilst', 'I', 'try', 'make', 'thing', 'clear', 'oh', 'yes', 'your', 'father', 'know']"

But he was not a good man of business.” I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: “I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try to explain as clearly as I can.” He explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of £87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a bright young companion. Apparently, however, he hadn’t. “The question is,” he went on, “the future. I understand you have no living relatives?” “I’m alone in the world,” I said, and was struck anew by my likeness to a film heroine. “You have friends?” “Every one has been very kind to me,” I said gratefully. “Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?”","['great', 'man', 'posterity', 'appreciate', 'but', 'good', 'man', 'business', 'I', 'know', 'quite', 'well', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Flemming', 'I', 'restrain', 'say', 'he', 'continue', 'I', 'suppose', 'understand', 'much', 'matter', 'I', 'try', 'explain', 'clearly', 'I', 'he', 'explain', 'unnecessary', 'length', 'the', 'upshot', 'seem', 'I', 'leave', 'face', 'life', 'sum', '£', '87', '17s', '4d', 'it', 'seem', 'strangely', 'unsatisfying', 'amount', 'I', 'wait', 'trepidation', 'come', 'next', 'I', 'fear', 'Mr.', 'Flemming', 'would', 'sure', 'aunt', 'Scotland', 'want', 'bright', 'young', 'companion', 'apparently', 'however', 'n’t', 'the', 'question', 'go', 'future', 'I', 'understand', 'live', 'relative', 'I', '’m', 'alone', 'world', 'I', 'say', 'strike', 'anew', 'likeness', 'film', 'heroine', 'you', 'friend', 'every', 'one', 'kind', 'I', 'say', 'gratefully', 'who', 'would', 'kind', 'one', 'young', 'charming']"

I quite understand. We will look round for something—suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming——” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do.

It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out—but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim. With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too.

She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth——” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident. And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: “I agree with you! She is certainly _very_ good-looking.” It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are. With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice hair.

When I had finished I looked almost unbelievably like the kind of orphan that walks out in a queue with a little bonnet and a red cloak. I noticed when I went down that Mrs. Flemming’s eyes rested on my exposed ears with quite a kindly glance. Mr. Flemming seemed puzzled. I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, “What _has_ the child done to herself?” On the whole the rest of the day passed off well. It was settled that I was to start at once to look for something to do. When I went to bed, I stared earnestly at my face in the glass. Was I really good-looking?

I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual. I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth.

I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to be proved in practice. It was early in January—the 8th, to be exact.

Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really _were_ points and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to find I was right. There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness.

He’s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn’t have a beard. Perhaps a tea-planter.” At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by fear—almost panic. He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over. There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I shrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command. I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination.

I am a medical man.” A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me. The thing wasn’t real—couldn’t be. Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. “Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.” We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice. “Now then, stand back there, will you? What’s the sense in crowding round.” A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I must get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper.

By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry. I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: ""1 7 . 1 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose.

I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body. First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls.

Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure.

He looked panic-stricken.” A stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats. The man might have seen a cat. I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward.

Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body. Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who acted as caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge opening on the main road, gave evidence.

He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter. Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them.

The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.” The police surgeon gave it as his opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The _Daily Budget_ had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the Tube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide. However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o’clock, and the woman was alive and well at three o’clock, the only logical conclusion to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in","['something', 'he', 'look', 'like', 'man', '’d', 'see', 'ghost', 'I', 'think', 'take', 'ill', 'on', 'following', 'day', 'another', 'lady', 'gentleman', 'come', 'see', 'property', 'discover', 'body', 'lie', 'floor', 'one', 'upstairs', 'room', 'Mrs.', 'James', 'identify', 'lady', 'come', 'day', 'the', 'house', 'agent', 'also', 'recognize', 'Mrs.', 'de', 'Castina', 'the', 'police', 'surgeon', 'give', 'opinion', 'woman', 'dead', 'twenty', 'four', 'hour', 'the', 'Daily', 'Budget', 'jump', 'conclusion', 'man', 'Tube', 'murder', 'woman', 'afterwards', 'commit', 'suicide', 'however', 'Tube', 'victim', 'dead', 'two', 'o’clock', 'woman', 'alive', 'well', 'three', 'o’clock', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'come', 'two', 'occurrence', 'nothing', 'order', 'view', 'house', 'Marlow', 'find']"

She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out.

The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind. Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was prejudiced—the Tube incident was my own pet mystery—but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities.

He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld.

You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What frightened him? It wasn’t me.

I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies. There’s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.” “He did that?” “Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time—except that I felt there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.” “H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. “In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.” “Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector.","['say', 'inspector', 'dryly', 'but', 'n’t', 'doctor', 'what', 'he', 'n’t', 'doctor', 'I', 'repeat', 'how', 'know', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'it', '’', 'difficult', 'say', 'exactly', 'I', '’ve', 'work', 'Hospital', 'war', 'I', '’ve', 'see', 'doctor', 'handle', 'body', 'there', '’', 'sort', 'deft', 'professional', 'callousness', 'man', 'not', 'get', 'besides', 'doctor', 'not', 'usually', 'feel', 'heart', 'right', 'side', 'body', 'he', 'yes', 'I', 'not', 'notice', 'specially', 'time', 'except', 'I', 'feel', 'something', 'wrong', 'but', 'I', 'work', 'I', 'get', 'home', 'I', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'look', 'unhandy', 'time', 'H’m', 'say', 'inspector', 'he', 'reach', 'slowly', 'pen', 'paper', 'in', 'run', 'hand', 'upper', 'part', 'man', '’s', 'body', 'would', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'take', 'anything', 'want', 'pocket', 'do', 'not', 'sound', 'likely', 'say', 'inspector']"

But from this moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless. “Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose to depart. “Yes,” I said.

It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen—one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless.

I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?) Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure. Figures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right, seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps. That sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible.

There _must_ be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house?

I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers. “Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not—not where——” I faltered.

There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now—servants and all that, you know. If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are——” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order. “Of course, if it’s already taken——” “Oh, I’m sure I beg your pardon, miss. I’ve been fairly pestered with these newspaper people. Not a minute’s peace.

If I had betrayed any interest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The _Daily Budget’s_ out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him—although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him—ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad—they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.” “Was she dark or fair?” I ventured. “You can’t tell from these newspaper portraits.” “Dark hair, and a very white face—too white for nature, I thought, and her lips reddened something cruel.

She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she was amused at something. That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on, and, as my John says, money is money nowadays.” I concurred heartily with John’s by no means original remarks. “The young man now,” said","['quite', 'another', 'thing', 'we', 'converse', 'like', 'old', 'friend', 'I', 'put', 'another', 'question', 'do', 'seem', 'nervous', 'upset', 'not', 'bit', 'she', 'smile', 'quiet', 'like', 'though', 'amuse', 'something', 'that', '’s', 'could', 'knock', 'feather', 'next', 'afternoon', 'people', 'come', 'run', 'call', 'police', 'say', '’d', 'murder', 'do', 'I', 'shall', 'never', 'get', 'set', 'foot', 'house', 'dark', 'I', 'would', 'not', 'ever', 'why', 'I', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'stay', 'lodge', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'not', 'bended', 'knee', 'I', 'think', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Pedler', 'canne', 'so', 'miss', 'he', 'come', 'back', 'England', 'hear', 'news', 'bended', 'knee', 'figure', 'speech', 'secretary', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'offer', 'we', 'double', 'pay', 'stay', 'John', 'say', 'money', 'money', 'nowadays', 'I', 'concur', 'heartily', 'John', '’s', 'means', 'original', 'remark', 'the', 'young', 'man', 'say']"

Not even when he came out again looking all queer.” “How long was he in the house?” “Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.” “How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss—not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it _was._ However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss.

All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure.

But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence my question to Mrs. James. Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil.","['next', 'the', 'doctor', 'remove', 'disguise', 'follow', 'woman', 'Marlow', 'but', 'possible', 'remove', 'rather', 'hastily', 'trace', 'spirit', 'gum', 'might', 'still', 'linger', 'chin', 'hence', 'question', 'Mrs.', 'James', 'Whilst', 'occupy', 'thought', 'I', 'arrive', 'low', 'old', 'fashioned', 'door', 'Mill', 'House', 'unlock', 'key', 'I', 'pass', 'inside', 'the', 'hall', 'low', 'dark', 'place', 'smell', 'forlorn', 'mildewy', 'in', 'spite', 'I', 'shiver', 'do', 'woman', 'come', 'smile', 'day', 'ago', 'feel', 'chill', 'premonition', 'enter', 'house', 'I', 'wonder', 'do', 'smile', 'fade', 'lip', 'nameless', 'dread', 'close', 'round', 'heart', 'or', 'go', 'upstairs', 'smile', 'still', 'unconscious', 'doom', 'soon', 'overtake', 'my', 'heart', 'beat', 'little', 'fast', 'be', 'house', 'really', 'empty', 'be', 'doom', 'wait', 'also', 'for', 'first', 'time', 'I', 'understand', 'meaning', 'much', 'use', 'word', 'atmosphere', 'there', 'atmosphere', 'house', 'atmosphere', 'cruelty', 'menace', 'evil']"

On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction. I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased.

As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven.

3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,1,"_(Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)_ It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved. I hate being involved. All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral.

But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner—the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them. I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily—trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with. Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there. “My dear fellow,” I cried, “you shall go to-morrow. I will pay all your expenses.” January isn’t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would be all one to Pagett.

I have done everything I wanted to, and nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes open, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at the unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom was over. “My dear fellow,” I said, “has the funeral already taken place, or is it for later in the morning?” Pagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared. “So you know, Sir Eustace?” “Know what?” I said crossly. “From the expression of your face I inferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred this morning.” Pagett ignored the sally as far as possible. “I thought you couldn’t know about this.” He tapped the telegram. “I know you dislike being aroused early—but it _is_ nine o’clock”—Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the middle of the day—“and I thought that under the circumstances——” He tapped the telegram again. “What is that thing?” I asked. “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow.

I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?” “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?” “The police——” “What on earth have I to do with the police?” “Well, it was your house.” “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.” Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily. “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously. I don’t see why it should have—and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him—but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily.

Another idea struck me. “Good heavens,” I exclaimed, “I hope this won’t upset Caroline.” Caroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife of my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but she is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good gardener—but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to live in solely on account of Caroline’s cooking. “I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett. “You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said. I expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends that I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify. _Three days later._ It is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England in winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this trouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline has been pacified—with double pay.

3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,6,"there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall go back to-morrow. _One day later._ Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate—very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler!

He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler—I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off——” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.” “Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service—a very great service.

The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.” “You will find the climate of South Africa delightful—quite delightful.” “My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there shortly before the war.” “I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round the package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts’s own hands, you understand? The _Kilmorden Castle_ sails on Saturday—quite a good boat.” I accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively. I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental policy. It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack.

Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show.

The passage-money will be our affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the passport, as though you had decided that you needed the services of a second secretary.” He seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he stared me down. “Very well,” I said feebly. “You will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.” “Very well,” I said again. After all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but I had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when I thought I had attained peace! I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart. “It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed.

3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ It is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the more it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm. I regret to say that at the first roll the _Kilmorden_ gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.” “Yes?” I said, curbing my impatience. “Miss Emery is leaving me.” Miss Emery was the governness. “As you have not yet succeeded in finding anything, I wondered if you would care—it would be so nice if you remained with us altogether?” I was touched. She didn’t want me, I knew. It was sheer Christian charity that prompted the offer. I felt remorseful for my secret criticism of her. Getting up, I ran impulsively across the room and flung my arms round her neck. “You’re a dear,” I said. “A dear, a dear, a dear! And thank you ever so much. But it’s all right, I’m off to South Africa on Saturday.” My abrupt onslaught had startled the good lady. She was not used to sudden demonstrations of affection.

It was the only thing I could think of on the spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at getting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further query. At parting, she slipped an envelope into my hand. Inside it I found five new crisp five-pound notes and the words: “I hope you will not be offended and will accept this with my love.” She was a very good, kind woman. I could not have continued to live in the same house with her, but I did recognize her intrinsic worth. So here I was, with twenty-five pounds in my pocket, facing the world and pursuing my adventure. It was on the fourth day that the stewardess finally urged me up on deck. Under the impression that I should die quicker below, I had steadfastly refused to leave my bunk. She now tempted me with the advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the boat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry land. Muffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was hauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay there with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired young man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me. “Hullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?” “Yes,” I replied, hating him. “Ah, you won’t know yourself in another day or two.

But I’ve seen people much worse than you, and two days later they were the life and soul of the ship. You’ll be the same.” I did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that he was a liar. I endeavoured to convey it by a glance. He chatted pleasantly for a few minutes more, then he mercifully departed. People passed and repassed, brisk couples “exercising,” curveting children, laughing young people. A few other pallid sufferers lay, like myself, in deck-chairs. The air was pleasant, crisp, not too cold, and the sun was shining brightly. Insensibly, I felt a little cheered. I began to watch the people. One woman in particular attracted me. She was about thirty, of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face and very blue eyes. Her clothes, though perfectly plain, had that indefinable air of “cut” about them which spoke of Paris. Also, in a pleasant but self-possessed way, she seemed to own the ship! Deck stewards ran to and fro obeying her commands. She had a special deck-chair, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of cushions. She changed her mind three times as to where she would like it placed. Throughout everything she remained attractive and charming. She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so without being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered—but of course I shouldn’t—it would amuse me to talk to her. We reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move, but I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board and spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers too.

3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,4,"an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly. When it came I enjoyed it. My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I put him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia. He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking man on board. When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him. The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday.

3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,5,"us.” I laughed. “Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy—he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered. “I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No—but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.” “About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll.

3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,6,"toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are—but I’ve got another roll.” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly. “Yes, I _do_ feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled.

Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea’s been too much for both of them. The other fellow hasn’t turned up yet. This man’s name is Pagett.” So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board. Probably only a coincidence, and yet—— “That’s Sir Eustace,” my informant continued, “sitting next to the Captain. Pompous old ass.” The more I studied the secretary’s face, the less I liked it. Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head—it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension. Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work——” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not_ 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along","['that', 'man', 'oh', '’s', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Pedler', '’s', 'secretary', 'be', 'sea', 'sick', 'poor', 'chap', 'appear', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'get', 'two', 'secretary', 'sea', '’s', 'much', 'the', 'fellow', 'not', 'turn', 'yet', 'this', 'man', '’s', 'name', 'Pagett', 'so', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Pedler', 'owner', 'Mill', 'House', 'board', 'probably', 'coincidence', 'yet', 'that', '’s', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'informant', 'continue', 'sit', 'next', 'Captain', 'pompous', 'old', 'ass', 'the', 'I', 'study', 'secretary', '’s', 'face', 'less', 'I', 'like', 'its', 'even', 'pallor', 'secretive', 'heavy', 'lidde', 'eye', 'curiously', 'flatten', 'head', 'give', 'feeling', 'distaste', 'apprehension', 'leave', 'saloon', 'time', 'I', 'close', 'behind', 'go', 'deck', 'he', 'speak', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'overhear', 'fragment', 'two', 'I', '’ll', 'see', 'cabin', 'shall', 'I', 'it', '’', 'impossible', 'work', 'trunk', 'my', 'dear', 'fellow', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'reply', 'my', 'cabin', 'intend', 'sleep', 'b', 'attempt', 'dress', 'I', 'never', 'intention', 'allow', 'sprawl', 'place', 'make', 'infernal', 'clicking', 'typewriter', 'that', '’', 'I', 'say', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'must', 'somewhere', 'work', 'here', 'I', 'part', 'company', 'go', 'see', 'removal', 'progress', 'I', 'find', 'steward', 'busy', 'task', 'very', 'nice', 'cabin', 'miss', 'on', 'D', 'deck', 'no', '13', 'oh', 'I', 'cry', 'not', '13', 'Thirteen', 'one', 'thing', 'I', 'superstitious', 'it', 'nice', 'cabin', 'I', 'inspect', 'waver', 'foolish', 'superstition', 'prevail', 'I', 'appeal', 'almost', 'tearfully', 'steward', 'be', 'not', 'cabin', 'I', 'the', 'steward', 'reflect', 'well', '’s', '17', 'along']"

Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir—larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way.

Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You _will_ let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were—whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain.

I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that—just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad—quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What _was_ the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that—and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. Something——Ah! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how—— I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17?","['world', 'good', 'the', 'sea', 'smooth', 'weather', 'grow', 'daily', 'warmer', 'Sea', 'sickness', 'thing', 'past', 'I', 'go', 'deck', 'initiate', 'mystery', 'deck', 'quoit', 'I', 'enter', 'name', 'various', 'sport', 'Tea', 'serve', 'deck', 'I', 'eat', 'heartily', 'after', 'tea', 'I', 'play', 'shovel', 'board', 'pleasant', 'young', 'man', 'they', 'extraordinarily', 'nice', 'I', 'feel', 'life', 'satisfactory', 'delightful', 'the', 'dress', 'bugle', 'come', 'surprise', 'I', 'hurry', 'new', 'cabin', 'the', 'stewardess', 'await', 'troubled', 'face', 'there', '’', 'terrible', 'smell', 'cabin', 'miss', 'what', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'I', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'I', 'doubt', '’ll', 'able', 'sleep', 'there', '’', 'deck', 'cabin', 'C', 'deck', 'I', 'believe', 'you', 'might', 'move', 'night', 'anyway', 'the', 'smell', 'really', 'pretty', 'bad', 'quite', 'nauseating', 'I', 'tell', 'stewardess', 'I', 'would', 'think', 'question', 'move', 'whilst', 'I', 'dress', 'I', 'hurry', 'toilet', 'sniff', 'distastefully', 'I', 'what', 'smell', 'dead', 'rat', 'no', 'bad', 'quite', 'different', 'yet', 'I', 'know', 'it', 'something', 'I', 'smell', 'something', '——', 'ah', 'I', 'get', 'Asafœtida', 'I', 'work', 'Hospital', 'dispensary', 'war', 'short', 'time', 'become', 'acquainted', 'various', 'nauseous', 'drug', 'Asafœtida', 'but', 'I', 'sink', 'sofa', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'thing', 'somebody', 'put', 'pinch', 'asafœtida', 'cabin', 'why', 'so', 'I', 'vacate', 'why', 'anxious', 'get', 'I', 'think', 'scene', 'afternoon', 'rather', 'different', 'point', 'view', 'what', 'Cabin', '17', 'make', 'many', 'people', 'anxious', 'get', 'hold', 'the', 'two', 'cabin', 'well', 'cabin', 'man', 'insist', 'stick', '17']"

At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known.

My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What _am_ I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor.

Not a word of thanks—of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound.

We were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity of bitter enemies.

At the door he turned back, and spoke over his shoulder. “I shall not thank you—now or at any other time. But I acknowledge the debt. Some day I will pay it.” He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating like a mill race.","['hate', 'remind', 'owe', 'life', 'I', 'n’t', 'care', 'I', 'want', 'hurt', 'I', 'never', 'want', 'hurt', 'one', 'much', 'I', 'wish', 'God', 'n’t', 'say', 'explosively', 'I', '’d', 'well', 'dead', 'I', '’m', 'glad', 'acknowledge', 'debt', 'you', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'I', 'save', 'life', 'I', '’m', 'wait', 'say', 'thank', 'if', 'look', 'could', 'kill', 'I', 'think', 'would', 'like', 'kill', 'he', 'push', 'roughly', 'past', 'at', 'door', 'turn', 'back', 'speak', 'shoulder', 'I', 'shall', 'thank', 'time', 'but', 'I', 'acknowledge', 'debt', 'some', 'day', 'I', 'pay', 'he', 'go', 'leave', 'clench', 'hand', 'heart', 'beat', 'like', 'mill', 'race']"

Mrs. Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you—only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re—you’re such an exquisitely finished product.” “Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss!

He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires _you_ very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy.

I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something. I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been searching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my head, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else could there be? I wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had not really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently?

Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the _Kilmorden Castle_ seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly. “But the purser had distinctly promised me that","['count', 'finger', 'people', 'behove', 'keep', 'watch', 'set', 'aside', 'visitor', 'night', 'promise', 'I', 'would', 'discover', 'board', 'another', 'day', 'pass', 'I', 'select', 'follow', 'person', 'worthy', 'notice', '1', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Pedler', 'he', 'owner', 'Mill', 'House', 'presence', 'Kilmorden', 'Castle', 'seem', 'something', 'coincidence', '2', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'sinister', 'look', 'secretary', 'whose', 'eagerness', 'obtain', 'Cabin', '17', 'marked', 'N.B.', 'find', 'whether', 'accompany', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Cannes', '3', 'the', 'Rev.', 'Edward', 'Chichester', 'all', 'I', 'obstinacy', 'Cabin', '17', 'might', 'entirely', 'due', 'peculiar', 'temperament', 'obstinacy', 'amazing', 'thing', 'but', 'little', 'conversation', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'would', 'come', 'amiss', 'I', 'decide', 'hastily', 'tie', 'handkerchief', 'round', 'rebellious', 'lock', 'I', 'go', 'deck', 'full', 'purpose', 'I', 'luck', 'my', 'quarry', 'lean', 'rail', 'drink', 'beef', 'tea', 'I', 'go', 'I', 'hope', '’ve', 'forgive', 'Cabin', '17', 'I', 'say', 'good', 'smile', 'I', 'consider', 'unchristian', 'bear', 'grudge', 'say', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'coldly', 'but', 'purser', 'distinctly', 'promise']"

But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.” “I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely _it._ Too much so perhaps. Was he—or was he not—just a little like a _stage_ clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly. Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human—he was a glorified type.

3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,6,"Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A—a—fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester—too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them.

They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair. “They’re so obliging—though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them the way somewhere, and instead of saying ‘first to the right, second to the left’ or something that one could follow, they pour out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with you.” “Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?” asked Sir Eustace, turning with a smile to his secretary. For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes—er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure.","['but', 'misleading', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'insist', 'Aqua', 'calda', 'certainly', 'ought', 'cold', 'water', 'hot', 'you', '’re', 'latin', 'scholar', 'say', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'smile', 'man', 'superior', 'Latin', 'say', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'but', 'I', 'notice', 'ask', 'translate', 'inscription', 'old', 'church', 'never', 'they', 'hem', 'haw', 'get', 'somehow', 'quite', 'right', 'say', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'I', 'always', 'but', 'I', 'love', 'Italians', 'continue', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'they', '’re', 'obliging', 'though', 'even', 'embarrassing', 'side', 'you', 'ask', 'way', 'somewhere', 'instead', 'say', 'first', 'right', 'second', 'left', 'something', 'one', 'could', 'follow', 'pour', 'flood', 'well', 'mean', 'direction', 'look', 'bewildered', 'take', 'kindly', 'arm', 'walk', 'way', 'be', 'experience', 'Florence', 'Pagett', 'ask', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'turn', 'smile', 'secretary', 'for', 'reason', 'question', 'seem', 'disconcert', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'he', 'stammer', 'flush', 'oh', 'quite', 'yes', 'er', 'quite', 'then', 'murmured', 'excuse', 'rise', 'leave', 'table', 'I', 'begin', 'suspect', 'Guy', 'Pagett', 'commit', 'dark', 'deed', 'Florence', 'remark', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'gaze', 'secretary', '’s', 'retreating', 'figure']"

It amuses me sometimes—especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly.

And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs.

In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region——” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes—slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian—an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion—that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head.

My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him.

He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work. What the devil does any one want to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my publishers my “Reminiscences” early in the summer, but what of it? Who really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what do my reminiscences amount to?

I tried kindness with him. “You look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,” I said easily. “What you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No—not another word. The work must wait.” The next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. “There’s no room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It’s full of trunks.” From his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles, something that had no business to be there. I explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact, it was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling. He gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at humour, and then reverted to the business in hand. “And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes”—he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?”","['invent', 'anecdote', 'people', 'I', 'might', 'meet', 'n’t', 'I', 'try', 'kindness', 'you', 'look', 'perfect', 'wreck', 'still', 'dear', 'chap', 'I', 'say', 'easily', 'what', 'need', 'deck', 'chair', 'sun', 'no', 'another', 'word', 'the', 'work', 'must', 'wait', 'the', 'next', 'thing', 'I', 'know', 'worry', 'extra', 'cabin', 'there', '’', 'room', 'work', 'cabin', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'it', '’', 'full', 'trunk', 'from', 'tone', 'might', 'think', 'trunk', 'blackbeetle', 'something', 'business', 'I', 'explain', 'though', 'might', 'aware', 'fact', 'usual', 'take', 'change', 'clothing', 'one', 'travel', 'he', 'give', 'wan', 'smile', 'always', 'greet', 'attempt', 'humour', 'revert', 'business', 'hand', 'and', 'could', 'hardly', 'work', 'little', 'hole', 'I', 'know', 'Pagett', '’s', 'little', 'holes”—he', 'usually', 'good', 'cabin', 'ship', 'I', '’m', 'sorry', 'Captain', 'not', 'turn', 'time', 'I', 'say', 'sarcastically', 'perhaps', '’d', 'like', 'dump', 'extra', 'luggage', 'cabin']"

He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk——” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us. He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading _The Upper Berth_ floated through my mind.","['Sarcasm', 'dangerous', 'man', 'like', 'Pagett', 'he', 'brighten', 'well', 'I', 'could', 'get', 'rid', 'typewriter', 'stationery', 'trunk', 'the', 'stationery', 'trunk', 'weigh', 'several', 'solid', 'ton', 'it', 'cause', 'endless', 'unpleasantness', 'porter', 'aim', 'Pagett', '’s', 'life', 'foist', 'it', 'perpetual', 'struggle', 'we', 'he', 'seem', 'regard', 'special', 'personal', 'property', 'I', 'hand', 'regard', 'charge', 'thing', 'secretary', 'really', 'useful', 'we', '’ll', 'get', 'extra', 'cabin', 'I', 'say', 'hastily', 'the', 'thing', 'seem', 'simple', 'enough', 'Pagett', 'person', 'love', 'make', 'mystery', 'he', 'come', 'next', 'day', 'face', 'like', 'Renaissance', 'conspirator', 'you', 'know', 'tell', 'get', 'Cabin', '17', 'office', 'well', 'have', 'stationery', 'trunk', 'jammed', 'doorway', 'the', 'doorway', 'size', 'cabin', 'reply', 'Pagett', 'seriously', 'but', 'I', 'tell', 'Sir', 'Eustace', '’', 'something', 'queer', 'cabin', 'Memories', 'read', 'the', 'Upper', 'Berth', 'float', 'mind']"

Ghosts don’t affect typewriters.” Pagett said that it wasn’t a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn’t got Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and a Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come to blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter. “Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,” he reiterated. “But they wouldn’t look at them.” “Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You _told_ me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it—13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more,","['if', 'mean', '’s', 'haunt', 'I', 'say', '’re', 'go', 'sleep', 'I', 'not', 'see', 'matter', 'ghost', 'not', 'affect', 'typewriter', 'Pagett', 'say', 'n’t', 'ghost', 'not', 'get', 'Cabin', '17', 'he', 'tell', 'long', 'garbled', 'story', 'apparently', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'girl', 'call', 'Beddingfeld', 'almost', 'come', 'blow', 'cabin', 'needless', 'say', 'girl', 'Pagett', 'apparently', 'feel', 'sore', 'matter', 'both', '13', '28', 'well', 'cabin', 'reiterate', 'but', 'would', 'not', 'look', 'well', 'I', 'say', 'stifle', 'yawn', 'matter', 'would', 'dear', 'Pagett', 'he', 'give', 'reproachful', 'look', 'you', 'tell', 'get', 'Cabin', '17', 'there', 'touch', 'boy', 'upon', 'burn', 'deck', 'Pagett', 'my', 'dear', 'fellow', 'I', 'say', 'testily', 'I', 'mention', 'no', '17', 'I', 'happen', 'observe', 'vacant', 'but', 'I', 'not', 'mean', 'make', 'stand', 'death', 'it—13', '28', 'would', 'do', 'we', 'equally', 'well', 'he', 'look', 'hurt', 'there', '’', 'something']"

I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs. He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself—or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror.

I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne. “What do you mean?” I said. “Of course I shall wear fancy dress. So will you.” Pagett shuddered. “So go down to the barber’s and see about it,” I finished. “I don’t think he’ll have any out sizes,” murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye. Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. “And order a table for six in the saloon,” I said. “We’ll have the Captain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair——” “You won’t get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who _is_ Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything—or thinks he does.

He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice. “If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started——” “My dear fellow,” I interrupted brutally, “that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks.” Pagett winced slightly. “It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time—— “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them.” “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately _poisoned!”_ “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it. “At any rate, Sir Eustace, _he_ thinks so—and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill,","['be', 'n’t', 'like', 'government', 'I', 'exclaim', 'here', '’', 'man', 'board', 'whose', 'business', 'carry', 'secret', 'document', 'go', 'give', 'peaceful', 'outsider', 'ask', 'let', 'alone', 'Pagett', 'look', 'even', 'mysterious', 'he', 'come', 'pace', 'near', 'drop', 'voice', 'if', 'ask', 'whole', 'thing', 'queer', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'look', 'illness', 'mine', 'start', 'my', 'dear', 'fellow', 'I', 'interrupt', 'brutally', 'bilious', 'attack', 'you', '’re', 'always', 'bilious', 'attack', 'Pagett', 'wince', 'slightly', 'it', 'n’t', 'usual', 'sort', 'bilious', 'attack', 'this', 'time', 'for', 'God', '’s', 'sake', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'condition', 'Pagett', 'I', 'not', 'want', 'hear', 'very', 'well', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'but', 'belief', 'I', 'deliberately', 'poison', 'ah', 'I', 'say', 'you', '’ve', 'talk', 'Rayburn', 'he', 'deny', 'at', 'rate', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'think', 'position', 'know', 'by', 'way', 'chap', 'I', 'ask', 'I', '’ve', 'set', 'eye', 'since', 'come', 'board', 'he', 'give', '’', 'ill']"

So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper.

Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her _tête-à-tête_ with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They _are_ the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces.

However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board”—an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party.

I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me.

That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa.

Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark.

It’s a horrible journey though, five days in the train.” “You must join me on my private car,” I said gallantly. “Oh, Sir Eustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?” “Do I mean it!” I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass of champagne. “Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,” sighed Mrs. Blair. “Ah, South Africa,” I said sentimentally, and began to quote from a recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. “What has South Africa to show the world?

And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject. He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically","['wool', 'wattle', 'herd', 'hide', 'gold', 'diamond', 'I', 'hurry', 'I', 'know', 'soon', 'I', 'pause', 'Reeves', 'would', 'butt', 'inform', 'hide', 'worthless', 'animal', 'hang', 'barbed', 'wire', 'something', 'sort', 'would', 'crab', 'everything', 'else', 'end', 'hardship', 'miner', 'Rand', 'and', 'I', 'mood', 'abuse', 'Capitalist', 'however', 'interruption', 'come', 'another', 'source', 'magic', 'word', 'diamond', 'Diamonds', 'say', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'ecstatically', 'Diamonds', 'breathe', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'they', 'address', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'I', 'suppose', '’ve', 'Kimberley', 'I', 'Kimberley', 'I', 'not', 'manage', 'say', 'time', 'race', 'inundate', 'question', 'what', 'mine', 'like', 'be', 'true', 'native', 'keep', 'shut', 'compound', 'and', 'race', 'answer', 'question', 'show', 'good', 'knowledge', 'subject', 'he', 'describe', 'method', 'house', 'native', 'search', 'institute', 'various', 'precaution', 'De', 'Beers', 'take', 'then', '’', 'practically']"

Thefts do occur—like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld. “Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles.

The diamonds were of every colour, pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley and Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems to inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to have taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they are made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet.

In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died intestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man whom he hardly knew.” The Colonel paused.

Under his tan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently Race’s story had moved him profoundly. Suddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and disappeared. “Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well—er—I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence.

So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was _my_ mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life.

I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No—I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But—but a stewardess came the other night—about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd?

A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life—that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life.

What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got _lots_ of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. _“I_ couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne!

The woman was murdered in _his_ house, and it’s _his_ secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up—and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But—yes—I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum.

She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester.

Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all _mean?_ What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning.

It was only a time and a date—and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but——” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces—the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd—but it’s Cabin 71! _My_ cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you","['precious', 'piece', 'paper', 'look', 'it', 'might', 'seem', 'rather', 'senseless', 'it', 'time', 'date', 'past', 'Suzanne', 'nod', 'that', '’s', 'course', 'no', 'n’t', 'paper', 'by', 'way', 'get', 'I', '’d', 'rather', 'like', 'see', 'I', 'bring', 'paper', 'Exhibit', 'A', 'I', 'hand', 'she', 'scrutinize', 'frown', 'there', '’', 'dot', '17', 'why', 'not', 'dot', '1', 'there', '’', 'space', 'I', 'point', 'yes', '’', 'space', 'suddenly', 'rise', 'peer', 'paper', 'hold', 'close', 'light', 'possible', 'there', 'repressed', 'excitement', 'manner', 'Anne', 'n’t', 'dot', 'that', '’', 'flaw', 'paper', 'a', 'flaw', 'paper', 'see', 'so', '’ve', 'get', 'ignore', 'go', 'space', 'space', 'I', 'rise', 'stand', 'I', 'read', 'figure', 'I', 'see', '1', '71', '22', 'you', 'see', 'say', 'Suzanne', '’', 'quite', 'it', '’', 'one', 'o’clock', 'still', '22nd', '’', 'Cabin', '71', 'my', 'cabin', 'Anne', 'we', 'stand', 'stare', 'pleased', 'new', 'discovery', 'rapt', 'excitement']"

Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No—it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one—some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey—but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her.

In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all—and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” _“Because she was dead._ Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil.

3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,10,"note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way—in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No—they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles?

They’re beauties too, Anne—and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean——?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. _Was_ it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for _my_ benefit?

I’ve never actually met him until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be _rolling._ You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence—my husband, you know.

That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne.

3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,1,"I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head. “Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress. “That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him—eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded—believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more.

3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,2,"than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little. On the voyage from Cape Town to England one of the passengers had handed him a roll of films with instructions that they were to be dropped onto the bunk in Cabin 71 at 1 a.m. on January 22nd on the outward journey. A lady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as a bet. I gathered that the steward had been liberally paid for his part in the transaction. The lady’s name had not been mentioned. Of course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing the purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the steward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the _Kilmorden_ seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on.

3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,3,"it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr. Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. “I have always longed to go to Italy,” I said. “And especially to Florence. Didn’t you enjoy it very much there?” “Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is some correspondence of Sir Eustace’s that——” I took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve. “Oh, you mustn’t run away!” I cried with the skittish accent of an elderly dowager. “I’m sure Sir Eustace wouldn’t like you to leave me alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk about Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!” I still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start he gave. “Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables——” “Oh, Mr.","['naturally', 'Chichester', 'first', 'claim', 'attention', 'indeed', 'I', 'point', 'reluctantly', 'dismiss', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'position', 'suspicious', 'character', 'chance', 'conversation', 'awaken', 'fresh', 'doubt', 'mind', 'I', 'forget', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', '’s', 'incomprehensible', 'emotion', 'mention', 'Florence', 'on', 'last', 'evening', 'board', 'sit', 'deck', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'address', 'perfectly', 'innocent', 'question', 'secretary', 'I', 'forget', 'exactly', 'something', 'railway', 'delay', 'Italy', 'I', 'notice', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'display', 'uneasiness', 'catch', 'attention', 'when', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'claim', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'dance', 'I', 'quickly', 'move', 'chair', 'next', 'secretary', 'I', 'determined', 'get', 'bottom', 'matter', 'I', 'always', 'long', 'go', 'Italy', 'I', 'say', 'and', 'especially', 'Florence', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'much', 'indeed', 'I', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'if', 'excuse', 'correspondence', 'Sir', 'Eustace', '’s', 'I', 'take', 'hold', 'firmly', 'coat', 'sleeve', 'oh', 'must', 'not', 'run', 'away', 'I', 'cry', 'skittish', 'accent', 'elderly', 'dowager', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'leave', 'alone', 'one', 'talk', 'you', 'never', 'seem', 'want', 'talk', 'Florence', 'oh', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'I', 'believe', 'guilty', 'secret', 'I', 'still', 'hand', 'arm', 'I', 'could', 'feel', 'sudden', 'start', 'give', 'not', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'say', 'earnestly', 'I', 'delighted', 'tell', 'really', 'cable', 'oh', 'Mr.']"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,4,"Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace——” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees——” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and—er—guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply. “And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er—the Madonna—er—Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered. The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken—since you were in Florence at the time. And yet——” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where—er—where——” “—did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow. You know Marlow?

That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett. No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That—and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this. We’re partners—I wouldn’t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you’re a friendless girl—what I want is a thrill, and I’m prepared to pay for it. We’re going into this together regardless of expense. To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it.

He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect——” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.” “Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also——” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately.

I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling. My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone—a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man—the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase—a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship.

Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation. The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected——” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr.—er—Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely. “Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once—I offer it again.

Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise. “Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain——” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in _my_ power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press—ever so little. “Like this—and squeeze the life out of you! And then—like our unconscious friend here, but with more success—fling your dead body to the sharks. What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real. Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. . . . With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet. “What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld.

He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her. . . .” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. _I_ could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. . . . For he must have loved her once—he must—he must—to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said—except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that—au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck.

It is really the greatest relief to get off the _Kilmorden._ The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my interests.

He has taken them straight from the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn’t know himself. I said so to him. “He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the middle of the night, Sir Eustace.” “Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace.

Lots of people even sleep on deck—very uncomfortable, I’ve always thought. The sailors wash you down with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.” I shuddered at the idea. “Anyway,” I continued, “if you went worrying some poor devil who was suffering from insomnia, I don’t wonder he landed you one.” Pagett looked patient. “If you would hear me out, Sir Eustace. I was convinced the man had been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business to be. The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel Race’s.” “Race,” I said, lighting a cigar carefully, “can look after himself without your assistance, Pagett.” I added as an afterthought: “So can I.” Pagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before imparting a secret. “You see, Sir Eustace, I fancied—and","['stair', 'saloon', 'I', 'follow', 'my', 'dear', 'Pagett', 'I', 'say', 'n’t', 'poor', 'chap', 'go', 'deck', 'without', 'footstep', 'dog', 'lot', 'people', 'even', 'sleep', 'deck', 'uncomfortable', 'I', '’ve', 'always', 'think', 'the', 'sailor', 'wash', 'rest', 'deck', 'five', 'morning', 'I', 'shudder', 'idea', 'anyway', 'I', 'continue', 'go', 'worry', 'poor', 'devil', 'suffer', 'insomnia', 'I', 'not', 'wonder', 'land', 'one', 'Pagett', 'look', 'patient', 'if', 'would', 'hear', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'convince', 'man', 'prowl', 'near', 'cabin', 'business', 'the', 'two', 'cabin', 'passage', 'Colonel', 'Race', '’s', 'race', 'I', 'say', 'light', 'cigar', 'carefully', 'look', 'without', 'assistance', 'Pagett', 'I', 'add', 'afterthought', 'so', 'I.', 'Pagett', 'come', 'near', 'breathe', 'heavily', 'always', 'impart', 'secret', 'you', 'see', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'fancy']"

Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. _“Something_ was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that.

He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own.

How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don’t know. He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea was to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact. But Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was all for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled out to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a herd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at my expense. We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned.","['you', 'accept', 'Rayburn', 'valuation', 'you', 'think', 'Rayburn', 'crook', 'I', 'say', 'slowly', 'Pagett', 'how', 'far', 'view', 'influence', 'resentment', 'black', 'eye', 'I', 'n’t', 'know', 'he', 'make', 'pretty', 'fair', 'case', 'Rayburn', 'and', 'appearance', 'latter', 'tell', 'my', 'idea', 'nothing', 'matter', 'a', 'man', 'permit', 'make', 'thorough', 'fool', 'anxious', 'broadcast', 'fact', 'but', 'Pagett', 'energy', 'unimpaire', 'recent', 'misfortune', 'vigorous', 'measure', 'he', 'way', 'course', 'he', 'bustle', 'police', 'station', 'send', 'innumerable', 'cable', 'bring', 'herd', 'English', 'dutch', 'official', 'drink', 'whisky', 'soda', 'expense', 'we', 'get', 'Milray', '’s', 'answer', 'evening', 'he', 'know', 'nothing', 'late', 'secretary', 'there', 'one', 'spot', 'comfort', 'extract', 'situation', 'at', 'rate', 'I', 'say', 'Pagett', 'not', 'poison']"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,8,"You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. _Later._ Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your","['you', 'one', 'ordinary', 'bilious', 'attack', 'I', 'see', 'wince', 'it', 'score', 'later', 'Pagett', 'element', 'his', 'brain', 'positively', 'scintillate', 'bright', 'idea', 'he', 'Rayburn', 'none', 'famous', 'Man', 'Brown', 'Suit', 'I', 'dare', 'say', 'right', 'he', 'usually', 'but', 'get', 'unpleasant', 'the', 'soon', 'I', 'get', 'Rhodesia', 'well', 'I', 'explain', 'Pagett', 'accompany', 'you', 'see', 'dear', 'fellow', 'I', 'say', 'must', 'remain', 'spot', 'you', 'might', 'require', 'identify', 'Rayburn', 'minute', 'and', 'besides', 'I', 'dignity', 'English', 'Member', 'Parliament', 'think', 'I', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'secretary', 'apparently', 'recently', 'indulge', 'vulgar', 'street', 'brawl', 'Pagett', 'wince', 'he', 'respectable', 'fellow', 'appearance', 'pain', 'tribulation', 'but']"

Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned. “I must have been very drunk if I asked Race.","['correspondence', 'note', 'speech', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'shall', 'manage', 'I', 'say', 'airily', 'your', 'private', 'car', 'attach', 'eleven', 'o’clock', 'train', 'morrow', 'Wednesday', 'morning', 'Pagett', 'continue', 'I', 'make', 'arrangement', 'be', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'take', 'maid', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'I', 'gasp', 'she', 'tell', 'offer', 'place', 'so', 'I', 'I', 'come', 'think', 'on', 'night', 'Fancy', 'Dress', 'ball', 'I', 'even', 'urge', 'come', 'but', 'I', 'never', 'think', 'would', 'delightful', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'want', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', '’s', 'society', 'way', 'Rhodesia', 'back', 'woman', 'require', 'lot', 'attention', 'and', 'confoundedly', 'way', 'sometimes', 'have', 'I', 'ask', 'one', 'else', 'I', 'say', 'nervously', 'one', 'thing', 'moment', 'expansion', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'seem', 'think', 'ask', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'well', 'I', 'groan', 'I', 'must', 'drunk', 'I', 'ask', 'Race']"

I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary. She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl.

3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck. I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly. Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something that satisfied my aching hunger for romance. Perfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the _Kilmorden_ glided nearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all dreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans are so anxious not to miss anything. “This is South Africa,” I kept saying to myself industriously, “South Africa, South Africa.

You’re seeing the world.” I had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed another figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew who it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me? It made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn’t meant them—or had I? I turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain. If Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not disturb him by advertising my presence. But to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck behind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned. “I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last night.” “It—it was a peculiar night,” I said hastily. It was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only thing I could think of. “Will you forgive me?” I held out my hand without a word. He took it. “There’s something else I want to say.” His gravity deepened. “Miss Beddingfeld, you may not","['world', 'this', 'world', 'you', 'see', 'think', 'Anne', 'Beddingfeld', 'pudding', 'head', 'you', '’re', 'see', 'world', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'boat', 'deck', 'I', 'observe', 'another', 'figure', 'lean', 'rail', 'absorb', 'I', 'rapidly', 'approach', 'city', 'even', 'turn', 'head', 'I', 'know', 'the', 'scene', 'last', 'night', 'seem', 'unreal', 'melodramatic', 'peaceful', 'morning', 'sunlight', 'what', 'must', 'think', 'it', 'make', 'hot', 'realize', 'thing', 'I', 'say', 'and', 'I', 'not', 'mean', 'I', 'I', 'turn', 'head', 'resolutely', 'away', 'stare', 'hard', 'table', 'Mountain', 'if', 'Rayburn', 'come', 'alone', 'I', 'least', 'need', 'disturb', 'advertise', 'presence', 'but', 'intense', 'surprise', 'I', 'hear', 'light', 'footfall', 'deck', 'behind', 'voice', 'pleasant', 'normal', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'yes', 'I', 'turn', 'I', 'want', 'apologize', 'I', 'behave', 'like', 'perfect', 'boor', 'last', 'night', 'it', 'peculiar', 'night', 'I', 'say', 'hastily', 'it', 'lucid', 'remark', 'absolutely', 'thing', 'I', 'could', 'think', 'will', 'forgive', 'I', 'hold', 'hand', 'without', 'word', 'he', 'take', 'there', '’', 'something', 'else', 'I', 'want', 'say', 'his', 'gravity', 'deepen', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'may']"

Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against—these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger—look at last night. They fancy you know something.

But be careful, always be on the look out for danger, and, look here, if at any time you should fall into their hands, don’t try and be clever—tell the whole truth, it will be your only chance.” “You make my flesh creep, Mr. Rayburn,” I said, with some truth. “Why do you take the trouble to warn me?” He did not answer for some minutes, then he said in a low voice: “It may be the last thing I can do for you. Once on shore I shall be all right—but I may not get on shore.” “What?” I cried. “You see, I’m afraid you’re not the only person on board who knows that I am ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’” “If you think that","['know', 'mix', 'rather', 'dangerous', 'business', 'I', 'gather', 'much', 'I', 'say', 'no', 'n’t', 'you', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'know', 'I', 'want', 'warn', 'leave', 'whole', 'thing', 'alone', 'it', 'can', 'not', 'concern', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'curiosity', 'lead', 'tamper', 'people', '’s', 'business', 'no', 'please', 'not', 'get', 'angry', 'I', '’m', 'speak', 'you', '’ve', 'idea', 'might', 'come', 'man', 'stop', 'nothing', 'they', 'absolutely', 'ruthless', 'already', '’re', 'danger', 'look', 'last', 'night', 'they', 'fancy', 'know', 'something', 'your', 'chance', 'persuade', '’re', 'mistaken', 'but', 'careful', 'always', 'look', 'danger', 'look', 'time', 'fall', 'hand', 'not', 'try', 'clever', 'tell', 'whole', 'truth', 'chance', 'you', 'make', 'flesh', 'creep', 'Mr.', 'Rayburn', 'I', 'say', 'truth', 'why', 'take', 'trouble', 'warn', 'he', 'answer', 'minute', 'say', 'low', 'voice', 'it', 'may', 'last', 'thing', 'I', 'once', 'shore', 'I', 'shall', 'right', 'I', 'may', 'get', 'shore', 'what', 'I', 'cry', 'you', 'see', 'I', '’m', 'afraid', '’re', 'person', 'board', 'know', 'I', 'the', 'man', 'Brown', 'Suit', 'if', 'think']"

No, but there’s one person on board who’s known all along. He’s only got to speak—and my number’s up. All the same, I’m taking a sporting chance that he won’t speak.” “Why?” “Because he’s a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the police have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I might be! Well, an hour will show.” He laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So—good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps—going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours.

The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight. Suzanne was not nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of course. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before breakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic yelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus.

In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I had always vaguely associated it with a _hula-hula,_ which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong—that is a _lava-lava._ At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I can’t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of _bacon-bacon,_ and then go out clad in a _jumper-jumper_ to pay the books.

He’d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was—only it wasn’t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.” Suzanne smiled. “Sir Eustace doesn’t like getting up early any more than I do. But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly. It was a distinct score for me. Suzanne left her face half anointed and pressed for details. I gave them to her. “It all gets more and more mysterious,” she cried. “I thought I was going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that you would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so sure. I hope Pagett won’t push me off the train some dark night.” “I think you’re still above suspicion, Suzanne.

Instead of attending to my economical suggestions, she added three words more: “enjoying myself hugely.” Suzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the hotel about eleven o’clock to fetch her. I was left to my own devices. I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum. He had read of my arrival on the _Kilmorden,_ in which I was described as the daughter of the late Professor Beddingfeld. He had known my father slightly and had had a great admiration for him.

It was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and highly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally escorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked that. To most people it would have been a treat—but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on. The people had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves. It was far too early to go to tea. I made for the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf board, I said “Yes, please.” Surfing looks perfectly easy.","['tea', 'afternoon', 'Villa', 'Muizenberg', 'he', 'give', 'instruction', 'get', 'it', 'pleasant', 'think', 'poor', 'Papa', 'still', 'remember', 'highly', 'think', 'I', 'foresaw', 'I', 'would', 'personally', 'escort', 'round', 'Museum', 'I', 'leave', 'Cape', 'Town', 'I', 'risk', 'to', 'people', 'would', 'treat', 'one', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'one', 'bring', 'morning', 'noon', 'night', 'I', 'put', 'good', 'hat', 'one', 'Suzanne', '’s', 'cast', 'off', 'least', 'crumple', 'white', 'linen', 'start', 'lunch', 'I', 'catch', 'fast', 'train', 'Muizenberg', 'get', 'half', 'hour', 'it', 'nice', 'trip', 'we', 'wound', 'slowly', 'round', 'base', 'Table', 'Mountain', 'flower', 'lovely', 'my', 'geography', 'weak', 'I', 'never', 'fully', 'realize', 'Cape', 'Town', 'peninsula', 'consequently', 'I', 'rather', 'surprised', 'get', 'train', 'find', 'face', 'sea', 'there', 'perfectly', 'entrance', 'bathing', 'go', 'the', 'people', 'short', 'curve', 'board', 'come', 'float', 'wave', 'it', 'far', 'early', 'go', 'tea', 'I', 'make', 'bathing', 'pavilion', 'say', 'would', 'I', 'surf', 'board', 'I', 'say', 'yes', 'please', 'surf', 'look', 'perfectly', 'easy']"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,10,"_It isn’t._ I say no more. I got very angry and fairly hurled my plank from me. Nevertheless, I determined to return on the first possible opportunity and have another go. I would not be beaten. Quite by mistake I then got a good run on my board, and came out delirious with happiness. Surfing is like that. You are either vigorously cursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself. I found the Villa Medgee after some little difficulty. It was right up on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages and villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. “Mrs. Raffini?” I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said. He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself.

3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,1,"It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on the screen—you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound to be an Episode IV. But in real life there was absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale. In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you","['it', 'remind', 'forcibly', 'Episode', 'III', 'the', 'Perils', 'Pamela', 'how', 'often', 'I', 'sit', 'sixpenny', 'seat', 'eat', 'twopenny', 'bar', 'milk', 'chocolate', 'yearn', 'similar', 'thing', 'happen', 'well', 'happen', 'vengeance', 'and', 'somehow', 'nearly', 'amusing', 'I', 'imagine', 'it', '’', 'well', 'screen', 'comfortable', 'knowledge', '’s', 'bind', 'Episode', 'IV', 'but', 'real', 'life', 'absolutely', 'guarantee', 'Anna', 'Adventuress', 'might', 'terminate', 'abruptly', 'end', 'Episode', 'yes', 'I', 'tight', 'place', 'all', 'thing', 'Rayburn', 'say', 'morning', 'come', 'back', 'unpleasant', 'distinctness', 'tell', 'truth', 'say', 'well', 'I', 'could', 'always', 'go', 'help', 'to', 'begin', 'would', 'story', 'believe', 'would', 'consider', 'likely', 'possible', 'I', 'start', 'mad', 'escapade', 'simply', 'strength', 'scrap', 'paper', 'smelling', 'moth', 'ball', 'it', 'sound', 'wildly', 'incredible', 'tale', 'in', 'moment', 'cold', 'sanity', 'I', 'curse', 'melodramatic', 'idiot', 'yearn', 'peaceful', 'boredom', 'Little', 'Hampsly', 'all', 'pass', 'mind', 'less', 'time', 'take', 'tell', 'my', 'first', 'instinctive', 'movement', 'step', 'backwards', 'feel', 'handle', 'door', 'my', 'captor', 'merely', 'grin', 'here']"

I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum. If I have made a mistake——” “A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!” He laughed coarsely. “What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police——” “Yap, yap, yap—like a little toy dog.” He laughed. I sat down on a chair. “I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said coldly. “Indeed?” “I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?” “So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?” Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances. Should I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. “Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom I am staying.” “I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.” His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but","['stay', 'remark', 'facetiously', 'I', 'good', 'put', 'bold', 'face', 'upon', 'matter', 'I', 'invite', 'come', 'curator', 'Cape', 'Town', 'Museum', 'if', 'I', 'make', 'mistake', 'a', 'mistake', 'oh', 'yes', 'big', 'mistake', 'he', 'laugh', 'coarsely', 'what', 'right', 'detain', 'I', 'shall', 'inform', 'police', 'Yap', 'yap', 'yap', 'like', 'little', 'toy', 'dog', 'he', 'laugh', 'I', 'sit', 'chair', 'I', 'conclude', 'dangerous', 'lunatic', 'I', 'say', 'coldly', 'indeed', 'I', 'like', 'point', 'friend', 'perfectly', 'well', 'aware', 'I', 'go', 'I', 'return', 'evening', 'come', 'search', 'you', 'understand', 'so', 'friend', 'know', 'which', 'thus', 'challenge', 'I', 'lightning', 'calculation', 'chance', 'should', 'I', 'mention', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'he', 'well', 'know', 'man', 'name', 'might', 'carry', 'weight', 'but', 'touch', 'Pagett', 'might', 'know', 'I', 'lie', 'well', 'risk', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'one', 'I', 'say', 'lightly', 'a', 'friend', 'mine', 'I', 'stay', 'I', 'think', 'say', 'captor', 'slyly', 'shake', 'orange', 'head', 'you', 'see', 'since', 'eleven', 'morning', 'and', 'receive', 'note', 'bid', 'come', 'lunch', 'time', 'his', 'word', 'show', 'closely', 'movement', 'follow']"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,3,"I was not going to give in without a fight. “You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.” To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! “Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. “Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.” For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me. “To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.” It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs.

I was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from crying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below I heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was going out. It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.

I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go. In the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It almost touched my bound hands. Even then it was not easy. It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched.

Still no sound—but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me—and then caught my breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said.

The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it. “All bluff. They haven’t an idea where she is.” “She spoke very positively.” “I dare say. I’ve looked into the matter, and we’ve nothing to fear. Anyway, it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ orders. You don’t want to go against them, I suppose?” The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it to be a hasty disclaimer. “But why not knock her on the head?” he growled. “It would be simple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?” “Yes,” said Chichester meditatively. “That is what I should do. She knows too much, that is certain. But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand—though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.”","['eye', 'keyhole', 'instead', 'ear', 'as', 'I', 'guess', 'one', 'speaker', 'big', 'Dutchman', 'the', 'man', 'sit', 'outside', 'circumscribed', 'range', 'vision', 'suddenly', 'rise', 'get', 'drink', 'his', 'back', 'black', 'clad', 'decorous', 'come', 'view', 'even', 'turn', 'round', 'I', 'know', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'now', 'I', 'begin', 'make', 'word', 'all', 'dangerous', 'suppose', 'friend', 'come', 'it', 'big', 'man', 'speak', 'Chichester', 'answer', 'he', 'drop', 'clerical', 'voice', 'entirely', 'no', 'wonder', 'I', 'recognize', 'all', 'bluff', 'they', 'n’t', 'idea', 'she', 'speak', 'positively', 'I', 'dare', 'say', 'I', '’ve', 'look', 'matter', '’ve', 'nothing', 'fear', 'anyway', '’', 'Colonel', '’s', 'order', 'you', 'not', 'want', 'go', 'I', 'suppose', 'the', 'Dutchman', 'ejaculate', 'something', 'language', 'I', 'judge', 'hasty', 'disclaimer', 'but', 'knock', 'head', 'growl', 'it', 'would', 'simple', 'the', 'boat', 'ready', 'she', 'could', 'take', 'sea', 'yes', 'say', 'Chichester', 'meditatively', 'that', 'I', 'she', 'know', 'much', 'certain', 'but', 'Colonel', 'man', 'like', 'play', 'lone', 'hand', 'though', 'one', 'else', 'must', 'something', 'word', 'seem', 'awaken', 'memory', 'annoy', 'he', 'want', 'information', 'kind', 'girl']"

It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. “Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to see.” “When do you leave?” “Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.” “Do you want to see the girl before you go?” “No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the ‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?” “I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think. What about food?” “A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed.

My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done.

Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. “I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the _Kilmorden Castle_ was steaming out to sea. And I had no means of knowing whether Chichester had sailed on her or not!","['I', 'slip', 'lair', 'very', 'carefully', 'I', 'creep', 'stair', 'the', 'hall', 'empty', 'like', 'flash', 'I', 'across', 'unlatche', 'door', 'outside', 'sunshine', 'I', 'run', 'drive', 'like', 'one', 'possess', 'once', 'outside', 'I', 'resume', 'normal', 'walk', 'People', 'stare', 'curiously', 'I', 'wonder', 'my', 'face', 'clothe', 'must', 'cover', 'dust', 'roll', 'attic', 'at', 'last', 'I', 'come', 'garage', 'I', 'go', 'I', 'meet', 'accident', 'I', 'explain', 'I', 'want', 'car', 'take', 'Cape', 'Town', 'I', 'must', 'catch', 'boat', 'Durban', 'I', 'long', 'wait', 'ten', 'minute', 'later', 'I', 'speed', 'along', 'direction', 'Cape', 'Town', 'I', 'must', 'know', 'Chichester', 'boat', 'whether', 'sail', 'I', 'could', 'determine', 'end', 'I', 'decide', 'Chichester', 'would', 'know', 'I', 'see', 'Villa', 'Muizenberg', 'he', 'would', 'doubtless', 'lay', 'trap', 'I', 'forewarned', 'and', 'man', 'I', 'man', 'seek', 'diamond', 'behalf', 'mysterious', 'Colonel', 'alas', 'plan', 'as', 'I', 'arrive', 'dock', 'Kilmorden', 'Castle', 'steam', 'sea', 'and', 'I', 'mean', 'know', 'whether', 'Chichester', 'sail']"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,1,"I drove to the hotel. There was no one in the lounge that I knew. I ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne’s door. Her voice bade me “come in.” When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck. “Anne, dear, where have you been? I’ve been worried to death about you. What have you been doing?” “Having adventures,” I replied. “Episode III of ‘The Perils of Pamela.’” I told her the whole story. She gave vent to a deep sigh when I finished. “Why do these things always happen to you?” she demanded plaintively. “Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. “And what are we all doing now?” she asked. “I don’t quite know,” I said thoughtfully. “You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett——” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the _Kilmorden,_ or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London","['I', 'drive', 'hotel', 'there', 'one', 'lounge', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'run', 'upstairs', 'tap', 'Suzanne', '’s', 'door', 'her', 'voice', 'bid', 'come', 'when', 'see', 'literally', 'fall', 'neck', 'Anne', 'dear', 'I', '’ve', 'worried', 'death', 'what', 'have', 'adventure', 'I', 'reply', 'Episode', 'III', 'the', 'Perils', 'Pamela', 'I', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'she', 'give', 'vent', 'deep', 'sigh', 'I', 'finish', 'why', 'thing', 'always', 'happen', 'demand', 'plaintively', 'why', 'one', 'gag', 'bind', 'hand', 'foot', 'you', 'would', 'not', 'like', 'I', 'assure', 'to', 'tell', 'truth', 'I', '’m', 'nearly', 'keen', 'adventure', 'I', 'a', 'little', 'sort', 'thing', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'Suzanne', 'seem', 'unconvinced', 'an', 'hour', 'two', 'gag', 'binding', 'would', 'change', 'view', 'quickly', 'enough', 'Suzanne', 'like', 'thrill', 'hate', 'uncomfortable', 'and', 'ask', 'I', 'n’t', 'quite', 'know', 'I', 'say', 'thoughtfully', 'you', 'still', 'go', 'Rhodesia', 'course', 'keep', 'eye', 'Pagett', 'and', 'that', 'difficulty', 'have', 'Chichester', 'go', 'Kilmorden', 'do', 'mean', 'carry', 'original', 'plan', 'go', 'Durban', 'the', 'hour', 'leave', 'Muizenberg', 'seem', 'point', 'affirmative', 'answer', 'question', 'in', 'case', 'I', 'might', 'go', 'Durban', 'train', 'I', 'fancy', 'I', 'get', 'boat', 'on', 'hand', 'news', 'escape', 'wire', 'Chichester', 'also', 'information', 'I', 'leave', 'Cape', 'Town', 'Durban', 'nothing', 'simple', 'leave', 'boat', 'either', 'Port', 'Elizabeth', 'East', 'London']"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,2,"and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.” “Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again—in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne. I shook my head ruefully. “I certainly didn’t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but for your drawing.” “The man’s a professional actor, I’m sure of it,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.” “I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something—even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” _“What?”_ I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. “It’s a fact, I believe. Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!” “Not Mr. Pagett?” “Oh, not Pagett—the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.” “Have they arrested him?” asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze.","['give', 'slip', 'completely', 'it', 'rather', 'knotty', 'problem', 'we', '’ll', 'inquire', 'train', 'Durban', 'anyway', 'I', 'say', 'and', '’s', 'late', 'morning', 'tea', 'say', 'Suzanne', 'we', '’ll', 'lounge', 'the', 'Durban', 'train', 'leave', '8.15', 'evening', 'tell', 'office', 'for', 'moment', 'I', 'postpone', 'decision', 'join', 'Suzanne', 'somewhat', 'belated', 'eleven', 'o’clock', 'tea', 'do', 'feel', 'would', 'really', 'recognize', 'Chichester', 'disguise', 'I', 'mean', 'ask', 'Suzanne', 'I', 'shake', 'head', 'ruefully', 'I', 'certainly', 'not', 'recognize', 'stewardess', 'never', 'drawing', 'the', 'man', '’', 'professional', 'actor', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'say', 'Suzanne', 'thoughtfully', 'his', 'make', 'perfectly', 'marvellous', 'he', 'might', 'come', 'boat', 'navvy', 'something', '’d', 'never', 'spot', 'you', '’re', 'cheer', 'I', 'say', 'at', 'minute', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'step', 'window', 'come', 'join', 'we', 'what', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'ask', 'Suzanne', 'I', 'not', 'see', 'day', 'rather', 'odd', 'expression', 'pass', 'Colonel', '’s', 'face', 'he', '’s', 'get', 'little', 'trouble', 'attend', 'keep', 'busy', 'tell', 'we', 'I', 'must', 'not', 'tell', 'tale', 'school', 'tell', 'we', 'something', 'even', 'invent', 'special', 'benefit', 'well', 'would', 'say', 'famous', 'man', 'Brown', 'Suit', 'make', 'voyage', 'we', 'what', 'I', 'feel', 'colour', 'die', 'face', 'surge', 'back', 'fortunately', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'look', 'it', '’', 'fact', 'I', 'believe', 'every', 'port', 'watch', 'bamboozle', 'Pedler', 'bring', 'secretary', 'not', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'oh', 'Pagett', 'fellow', 'Rayburn', 'call', 'have', 'arrest', 'ask', 'Suzanne', 'under', 'table', 'give', 'hand', 'reassuring', 'squeeze']"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,3,"I waited breathlessly for an answer. “He seems to have disappeared into thin air.” “How does Sir Eustace take it?” “Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.” An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace’s views on the matter presented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house—on purpose to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too—just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries—unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne.

He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that","['long', 'reply', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'gallantly', 'I', 'shall', 'n’t', 'get', 'much', 'typing', 'do', 'rate', 'I', 'remind', 'that', 'not', 'matter', 'all', 'work', 'Pagett', '’s', 'idea', 'he', 'work', 'death', 'I', '’m', 'look', 'forward', 'leave', 'behind', 'Cape', 'Town', 'he', 'stay', 'behind', 'yes', '’ll', 'enjoy', 'thoroughly', 'sleuth', 'Rayburn', 'that', '’', 'sort', 'thing', 'suit', 'Pagett', 'ground', 'he', 'adore', 'intrigue', 'but', 'I', '’m', 'quite', 'serious', 'offer', 'will', 'come', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'competent', 'chaperon', 'half', 'holiday', 'every', 'dig', 'bone', 'thank', 'much', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'say', 'cautiously', 'I', 'think', 'I', '’m', 'leave', 'Durban', 'night', 'now', 'not', 'obstinate', 'girl', 'remember', 'lot', 'lion', 'Rhodesia', 'you', '’ll', 'like', 'lion', 'all', 'girl', 'will', 'practise', 'low', 'jump', 'I', 'ask', 'laugh', 'no', 'thank', 'much', 'I', 'must', 'go', 'Durban', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'look', 'sigh', 'deeply', 'open', 'door', 'adjoining', 'room', 'call', 'Pagett', 'if', '’ve', 'quite', 'finish', 'afternoon', 'sleep', 'dear', 'fellow', 'perhaps', '’d', 'little', 'work', 'change', 'Guy', 'Pagett', 'appear', 'doorway', 'he', 'bow', 'we', 'start', 'slightly', 'sight', 'reply', 'melancholy', 'voice', 'I', 'type', 'memorandum', 'afternoon', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'well', 'stop', 'type', 'go', 'Trade', 'Commissioner', '’s', 'Office', 'Board', 'Agriculture', 'Chamber', 'Mines', 'one', 'place', 'ask', 'lend', 'kind', 'woman', 'take', 'Rhodesia', 'she', 'must', 'liquid', 'eye', 'object', 'hold', 'hand', 'yes', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'ask', 'competent', 'short', 'hand', 'typist', 'Pagett', '’', 'malicious', 'fellow', 'say', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'secretary', 'depart', 'I', '’d', 'prepare', 'bet']"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,5,"he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too—I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans—and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here—you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia—which is very annoying, because I _want_ to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat—or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house——” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious.

3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,6,"“Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race——” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, _“Edgar_ says——” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this","['really', 'Suzanne', 'I', 'cry', 'seem', 'think', 'game', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'say', 'Suzanne', 'unabashed', 'it', 'seem', 'like', 'it', '’', 'fault', 'Anne', 'I', '’ve', 'got', 'imbue', 'let', '’s', 'adventure', 'spirit', 'it', 'not', 'seem', 'bit', 'real', 'dear', 'Clarence', 'know', 'I', 'run', 'Africa', 'track', 'dangerous', 'criminal', '’d', 'fit', 'why', 'not', 'cable', 'I', 'ask', 'sarcastically', 'Suzanne', '’s', 'sense', 'humour', 'always', 'fail', 'come', 'send', 'cable', 'she', 'consider', 'suggestion', 'perfectly', 'good', 'faith', 'I', 'might', 'it', 'would', 'long', 'one', 'her', 'eye', 'brighten', 'thought', 'but', 'I', 'think', '’', 'well', 'husband', 'always', 'want', 'interfere', 'perfectly', 'harmless', 'amusement', 'well', 'I', 'say', 'sum', 'situation', 'keep', 'eye', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'I', 'know', 'I', '’ve', 'get', 'watch', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'interrupt', 'Suzanne', 'figure', 'humorous', 'conversation', 'but', 'I', 'think', '’s', 'carry', 'rather', 'far', 'suspect', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'I', 'indeed', 'why', '’', 'something', 'Secret', 'Service', 'do', 'know', 'Anne', 'I', 'believe', 'good', 'thing', 'could', 'would', 'confide', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'I', 'object', 'vigorously', 'unsporting', 'proposal', 'I', 'recognize', 'disastrous', 'effect', 'matrimony', 'how', 'often', 'I', 'hear', 'perfectly', 'intelligent', 'female', 'say', 'tone', 'one', 'clinch', 'argument', 'Edgar', 'say', 'and', 'time', 'perfectly', 'aware', 'Edgar', 'perfect', 'fool', 'Suzanne', 'reason', 'married', 'state', 'yearn', 'lean', 'upon', 'man', 'however', 'promise', 'faithfully', 'would', 'breathe', 'word', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'go', 'plan', 'making', 'it', '’', 'quite', 'clear', 'I', 'must', 'stay', 'watch', 'Pagett']"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,7,"is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a little—wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window. Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard. You wouldn’t like me to come with you, would you?” “I should love it.” “Nice girl. Sure you won’t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?” “Quite sure.” “He must be a very handsome fellow,” said Sir Eustace plaintively. “Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two.

You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she hold your hand?” “I devoutly hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be the last straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan’t give you the skin—after the base way you’ve deserted me.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall. She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi. Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I——” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed. “Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station.

It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train. And what could I do? Nothing. I saw myself, in a quarter of an hour’s time, steaming out of the station with Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu. He had turned the tables on me adroitly. His manner towards me had changed, moreover. It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat ill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite. First he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did he imagine for one minute that I hadn’t recognized him that night on the boat? No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to acquiesce in, his tongue in his cheek all the while. Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment—I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him.

Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side—in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy——” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me.

3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,1,"I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town.","['I', 'difficulty', 'carry', 'plan', 'I', 'find', 'small', 'hotel', 'back', 'street', 'get', 'room', 'pay', 'deposit', 'I', 'luggage', 'go', 'placidly', 'bed', 'on', 'follow', 'morning', 'I', 'early', 'go', 'town', 'purchase', 'modest', 'wardrobe', 'my', 'idea', 'nothing', 'departure', 'eleven', 'o’clock', 'train', 'Rhodesia', 'party', 'board', 'Pagett', 'likely', 'indulge', 'nefarious', 'activity', 'got', 'rid', 'accordingly', 'I', 'take', 'tram', 'town', 'proceed', 'enjoy', 'country', 'walk', 'it', 'comparatively', 'cool', 'I', 'glad', 'stretch', 'leg', 'long', 'voyage', 'close', 'confinement', 'Muizenberg', 'a', 'lot', 'hinge', 'small', 'thing', 'my', 'shoe', 'lace', 'come', 'untie', 'I', 'stop', 'the', 'road', 'turn', 'corner', 'I', 'bend', 'offend', 'shoe', 'man', 'come', 'right', 'round', 'almost', 'walk', 'he', 'lift', 'hat', 'murmur', 'apology', 'go', 'it', 'strike', 'time', 'face', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'moment', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'look', 'wrist', 'watch', 'the', 'time', 'get', 'I', 'turn', 'foot', 'direction', 'Cape', 'Town']"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,2,"There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking.

Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the “Colonel”! I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand and the causes underlying it—and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That was the “Colonel’s” work, his emissaries were acting according to plan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work—not the dangerous labour—for him. But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently impeccable position. That, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race’s presence on the _Kilmorden Castle._ He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything fitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself—things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head.

Some knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them anxious to remove me at all costs—and that knowledge was bound up somehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who could enlighten me—if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit—Harry Rayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished into the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit. In all probability he and I would never meet again. . . . I brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment. It was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at least——There I was again—dreaming! The real problem was what to do—_now!_ I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid!

3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,5,"I had saved myself—but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city—with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas—to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door.

Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other—pocket-picking, perhaps.

I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, _for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes!_ It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then.

An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock—one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so. In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform.

We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office—middle compartment—dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race. “His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed.

3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,10,"I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily. Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech at——What’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.” He took it from her and sharpened it. Sir Eustace stared, and so did I.

Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa.

To-morrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland. The dust will be atrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves.

First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station—if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter. I imitated her example—most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different.

South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out. We talked half the night.

Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett—and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious “Colonel.” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight.","['race', 'powerful', 'protector', 'I', 'judge', 'enemy', 'would', 'wish', 'stir', 'hornet', '’s', 'nest', 'ear', 'also', 'long', 'I', 'near', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'less', 'touch', 'Guy', 'Pagett', 'Guy', 'Pagett', 'heart', 'mystery', 'I', 'ask', 'Suzanne', 'whether', 'opinion', 'possible', 'Pagett', 'mysterious', 'Colonel', 'his', 'subordinate', 'position', 'course', 'assumption', 'strike', 'twice', 'autocratic', 'way', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'really', 'much', 'influence', 'secretary', 'he', 'easy', 'go', 'man', 'one', 'adroit', 'secretary', 'might', 'able', 'twist', 'round', 'little', 'finger', 'the', 'comparative', 'obscurity', 'position', 'might', 'reality', 'useful', 'since', 'would', 'anxious', 'well', 'limelight']"

The real head—the “Colonel”—was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival. I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal—but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution. “There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same.

I don’t really suspect him—but, after all, he _is_ Pagett’s employer, and he _did_ own the Mill House.” “I’ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn’t anxious to talk about,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean crime—it might be tin-tacks or hair restorer!” I agreed ruefully. “I suppose,” said Suzanne doubtfully, “that we’re not barking up the wrong tree?

Now we know that’s not true.” “No,” said Suzanne unwillingly. “But we only heard the story at second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we’d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.” I turned the thing over in my mind. “No,” I said at last, “I don’t see any way out. Pagett’s guilty.

The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could.

3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,1,"We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him—especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail. It had character. It had charm. A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged—me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each—and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could. And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town—when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament. He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered","['we', 'arrive', 'Bulawayo', 'early', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'I', 'disappoint', 'place', 'it', 'hot', 'I', 'hate', 'hotel', 'also', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'describe', 'thoroughly', 'sulky', 'I', 'think', 'wooden', 'animal', 'annoy', 'especially', 'big', 'giraffe', 'it', 'colossal', 'giraffe', 'impossible', 'neck', 'mild', 'eye', 'dejected', 'tail', 'it', 'character', 'it', 'charm', 'a', 'controversy', 'already', 'arise', 'belong', 'Suzanne', 'we', 'contribute', 'tiki', 'purchase', 'Suzanne', 'advance', 'claim', 'seniority', 'married', 'state', 'I', 'stick', 'position', 'I', 'first', 'behold', 'beauty', 'in', 'meantime', 'I', 'must', 'admit', 'occupy', 'good', 'deal', 'three', 'dimensional', 'space', 'to', 'carry', 'forty', 'nine', 'wooden', 'animal', 'awkward', 'shape', 'extremely', 'brittle', 'wood', 'somewhat', 'problem', 'two', 'porter', 'laden', 'bunch', 'animal', 'one', 'promptly', 'drop', 'ravish', 'group', 'ostrich', 'break', 'head', 'warn', 'Suzanne', 'I', 'carry', 'could', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'help', 'I', 'press', 'big', 'giraffe', 'Sir', 'Eustace', '’s', 'arm', 'even', 'correct', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'escape', 'large', 'hippopotamus', 'two', 'black', 'warrior', 'fall', 'share', 'I', 'feeling', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'n’t', 'like', 'perhaps', 'fancy', 'I', 'bold', 'hussy', 'anyway', 'avoid', 'much', 'could', 'and', 'funny', 'thing', 'face', 'seem', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'though', 'I', 'could', 'not', 'quite', 'place', 'we', 'repose', 'morning', 'afternoon', 'drive', 'Matoppos', 'see', 'Rhodes', '’s', 'grave', 'that', 'say', 'do', 'last', 'moment', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'back', 'he', 'nearly', 'bad', 'temper', 'morning', 'arrive', 'Cape', 'Town', 'bounce', 'peach', 'floor', 'squash', 'evidently', 'arrive', 'early', 'morning', 'place', 'bad', 'temperament', 'he', 'curse', 'porter', 'curse', 'waiter', 'breakfast', 'curse', 'whole', 'hotel', 'management', 'would', 'doubtless', 'like', 'curse', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'hover']"

I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her. And at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she had a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone. He is a strange man. One doesn’t notice it so much in a crowd. But, when one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do. It was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent—except our car which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior. By and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel Race. “There must have been giants once,” I said dreamily. “And their children were just like children are to-day—they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big—that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes.

He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me.

So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do—though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength—like lions and tigers——” “And giraffes?” interpolated Colonel Race slyly. I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same—one _feels_ the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men—it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true—if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end—if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t—and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love—and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or","['death', 'lightly', 'yes', 'I', 'say', 'think', 'Harry', 'Rayburn', 'he', 'like', 'but', 'cruel', 'weak', 'thing', 'opinion', 'differ', 'weak', 'thing', 'Miss', 'Anne', 'there', 'note', 'seriousness', 'voice', 'almost', 'startle', 'I', 'feel', 'I', 'know', 'little', 'really', 'man', 'side', 'I', 'mean', 'child', 'dog', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'truthfully', 'say', 'I', '’ve', 'never', 'cruel', 'child', 'dog', 'so', 'n’t', 'class', 'woman', 'weak', 'thing', 'I', 'consider', 'no', 'I', 'not', 'think', 'I', 'though', 'I', 'suppose', 'that', 'nowadays', 'but', 'Papa', 'always', 'say', 'begin', 'man', 'woman', 'roam', 'world', 'together', 'equal', 'strength', 'like', 'lion', 'tiger', 'and', 'giraffe', 'interpolate', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'slyly', 'I', 'laugh', 'every', 'one', 'make', 'fun', 'giraffe', 'and', 'giraffe', 'they', 'nomadic', 'see', 'it', 'n’t', 'till', 'settle', 'community', 'woman', 'one', 'kind', 'thing', 'man', 'another', 'woman', 'get', 'weak', 'and', 'course', 'underneath', 'one', 'still', 'one', 'feel', 'I', 'mean', 'woman', 'worship', 'physical', 'strength', 'man', '’', 'lose', 'almost', 'ancestor', 'worship', 'fact', 'something', 'kind', 'and', 'really', 'think', '’s', 'true', 'that', 'woman', 'worship', 'strength', 'I', 'mean', 'I', 'think', '’', 'quite', 'true', 'one', '’', 'honest', 'you', 'think', 'admire', 'moral', 'quality', 'fall', 'love', 'revert', 'primitive', 'physical', 'count', 'but', 'I', 'not', 'think', '’', 'end', 'live', 'primitive', 'condition', 'would', 'right', 'don’t', 'end', 'thing', 'win', 'it', '’', 'thing', 'apparently', 'conquer', 'always', 'win', 'n’t', 'they', 'win', 'way', 'count', 'like', 'Bible', 'say', 'lose', 'soul', 'find', 'in', 'end', 'say', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'thoughtfully', 'fall', 'love', 'fall', 'mean', 'not', 'exactly', 'put', 'way', 'like', 'but', 'I', 'not', 'think', '’ve', 'ever', 'fall', 'love', 'Miss', 'Anne', 'no', 'I', 'n’t', 'I', 'admit', 'frankly', 'or']"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,4,"fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand—snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid—afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are _you_ really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that—pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly,","['fall', 'love', 'either', 'I', 'answer', 'the', 'car', 'draw', 'destination', 'bring', 'conversation', 'close', 'we', 'get', 'begin', 'slow', 'ascent', 'World', '’s', 'view', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'I', 'feel', 'slight', 'discomfort', 'Colonel', 'Race', '’s', 'company', 'he', 'veil', 'thought', 'well', 'behind', 'impenetrable', 'black', 'eye', 'he', 'frighten', 'little', 'he', 'always', 'frighten', 'I', 'never', 'know', 'I', 'stand', 'we', 'climb', 'silence', 'till', 'reach', 'spot', 'Rhodes', 'lie', 'guard', 'giant', 'boulder', 'a', 'strange', 'eerie', 'place', 'far', 'haunt', 'man', 'sing', 'ceaseless', 'pæan', 'rugged', 'beauty', 'we', 'sit', 'time', 'silence', 'then', 'descend', 'diverge', 'slightly', 'path', 'sometimes', 'rough', 'scramble', 'come', 'sharp', 'slope', 'rock', 'almost', 'sheer', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'go', 'first', 'turn', 'help', 'well', 'lift', 'say', 'suddenly', 'swing', 'foot', 'quick', 'gesture', 'I', 'feel', 'strength', 'set', 'release', 'clasp', 'a', 'man', 'iron', 'muscle', 'like', 'taut', 'steel', 'and', 'I', 'feel', 'afraid', 'especially', 'move', 'aside', 'stand', 'directly', 'front', 'stare', 'face', 'what', 'really', 'Anne', 'Beddingfeld', 'say', 'abruptly', 'I', '’m', 'gipsy', 'see', 'world', 'yes', '’s', 'true', 'enough', 'the', 'newspaper', 'correspondent', 'pretext', 'you', '’ve', 'soul', 'journalist', 'you', '’re', 'hand', 'snatch', 'life', 'but', '’s', 'what', 'go', 'make', 'tell', 'I', 'afraid', 'afraid', 'I', 'look', 'full', 'face', 'my', 'eye', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'secret', 'like', 'carry', 'war', 'enemy', '’s', 'country', 'what', 'really', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'I', 'ask', 'deliberately', 'for', 'moment', 'I', 'think', 'not', 'go', 'answer', 'he', 'clearly', 'take', 'aback', 'though', 'at', 'last', 'speak', 'word', 'seem', 'afford', 'grim', 'amusement', 'pursue', 'ambition', 'say', 'just', 'pursue', 'ambition', 'you', 'remember', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'sin', 'fall', 'angel', 'etc', 'they', 'say', 'I', 'say', 'slowly']"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,5,"“that you are really connected with the Government—that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked. Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us—I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel—but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out—I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten.

And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t—don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless—like I am. That’s the secret of strength—and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not. You see—I—care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning—when I first saw you—on the _Kilmorden?”_ “No,” I whispered. “It was—since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What—what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only—that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand—and it frightened me. We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. _“Alias_ the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats—I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp.

3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,7,"have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.” “It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves—or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds——” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills. I loved it—loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always—always. . . . Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home. . . . Home! And yet I had never been here before—or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely wired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses.

3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,8,"gasp. There, half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls. I’ve never seen anything so grand and beautiful—I never shall. “Anne, you’re fey,” said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. “I’ve never seen you like this before.” She stared at me curiously. “Am I?” I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. “It’s just that I love it all.” “It’s more than that.” A little frown creased her brow—one of apprehension. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something—something that would happen soon. I was excited—restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls—their elusive quality. You always think you’re going to see—and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into","['gasp', 'there', 'half', 'mile', 'away', 'face', 'we', 'Falls', 'I', '’ve', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'grand', 'beautiful', 'I', 'never', 'shall', 'Anne', '’re', 'fey', 'say', 'Suzanne', 'sit', 'lunch', 'I', '’ve', 'never', 'see', 'like', 'she', 'stare', 'curiously', 'be', 'I', 'I', 'laugh', 'I', 'feel', 'laugh', 'unnatural', 'it', '’', 'I', 'love', 'it', '’', 'a', 'little', 'frown', 'crease', 'brow', 'one', 'apprehension', 'yes', 'I', 'happy', 'beyond', 'I', 'curious', 'feeling', 'I', 'wait', 'something', 'something', 'would', 'happen', 'soon', 'I', 'excited', 'restless', 'after', 'tea', 'stroll', 'get', 'trolley', 'push', 'smile', 'black', 'little', 'track', 'rail', 'bridge', 'it', 'marvellous', 'sight', 'great', 'chasm', 'rushing', 'water', 'veil', 'mist', 'spray', 'front', 'we', 'part', 'every', 'one', 'brief', 'minute', 'show', 'cataract', 'water', 'close', 'impenetrable', 'mystery', 'that', 'mind', 'always', 'fascination', 'Falls', 'elusive', 'quality', 'you', 'always', 'think', '’re', 'go', 'see', 'never', 'we', 'cross', 'bridge', 'walk', 'slowly', 'path', 'mark', 'white', 'stone', 'either', 'side', 'lead', 'round', 'brink', 'gorge', 'finally', 'arrive', 'big', 'clearing', 'leave', 'path', 'lead', 'downward', 'towards', 'chasm', 'the', 'palm', 'gully', 'explain', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'shall', 'go', 'or', 'shall', 'leave', 'morrow', 'it', 'take', 'time', '’', 'good', 'climb', 'we', '’ll', 'leave', 'morrow', 'say', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'decision', 'he', 'not', 'fond', 'strenuous', 'physical', 'exercise', 'I', 'notice', 'he', 'lead', 'way', 'back', 'as', 'go', 'pass', 'fine', 'native', 'stalking', 'along', 'behind', 'come', 'woman', 'seem', 'entire', 'household', 'belonging', 'pile', 'upon', 'head', 'the', 'collection', 'include', 'fry', 'pan', 'I', 'never', 'camera', 'I', 'want', 'groan', 'Suzanne', 'that', '’', 'opportunity', 'occur', 'often', 'enough', 'Mrs.', 'Blair', 'say', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'so', 'n’t', 'lament', 'we', 'arrive', 'back', 'bridge', 'shall', 'go']"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,9,"the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren’t nearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every now and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized how enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall! We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race. Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn’t get much satisfaction. After dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. . . . There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very short: “I must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come. The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.” My heart beat to suffocation. He was here then!

Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour——” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge. But the minutes passed, and no one came. I had not been followed. I turned and took the path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped. Something had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had followed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here, waiting. And immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of instinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was the same feeling as I had had on the _Kilmorden_ that night—a sure instinct warning me of danger. I looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or two. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my shoulder again. A man’s figure came out of the shadow. He saw that I saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track. It was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he was tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran. I heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no moon that night. And suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me laugh, an evil, sinister laugh. It rang in my ears, as I fell headlong—down—down—down to destruction far beneath.","['along', 'Suzanne', '’s', 'room', 'she', 'fast', 'asleep', 'I', 'could', 'hear', 'breathe', 'evenly', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'pause', 'outside', 'door', 'sitting', 'room', 'yes', 'dictate', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'I', 'could', 'hear', 'monotonous', 'voice', 'repeat', 'I', 'therefore', 'venture', 'suggest', 'tackle', 'problem', 'coloured', 'labour', 'she', 'pause', 'continue', 'I', 'hear', 'grunt', 'something', 'angrily', 'I', 'steal', 'Colonel', 'Race', '’s', 'room', 'empty', 'I', 'see', 'lounge', 'and', 'man', 'I', 'fear', 'still', 'I', 'could', 'waste', 'time', 'I', 'slip', 'quickly', 'hotel', 'take', 'path', 'bridge', 'I', 'cross', 'stand', 'wait', 'shadow', 'if', 'one', 'follow', 'I', 'see', 'cross', 'bridge', 'but', 'minute', 'pass', 'one', 'come', 'I', 'follow', 'I', 'turn', 'take', 'path', 'clearing', 'I', 'take', 'six', 'pace', 'stop', 'something', 'rustle', 'behind', 'it', 'could', 'one', 'follow', 'hotel', 'it', 'one', 'already', 'wait', 'and', 'immediately', 'without', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'sureness', 'instinct', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'threaten', 'it', 'feeling', 'I', 'Kilmorden', 'night', 'sure', 'instinct', 'warn', 'danger', 'I', 'look', 'sharply', 'shoulder', 'silence', 'I', 'move', 'pace', 'two', 'again', 'I', 'hear', 'rustle', 'still', 'walk', 'I', 'look', 'shoulder', 'a', 'man', '’s', 'figure', 'come', 'shadow', 'he', 'see', 'I', 'see', 'jump', 'forward', 'hard', 'track', 'it', 'dark', 'recognize', 'anybody', 'all', 'I', 'could', 'see', 'tall', 'European', 'native', 'I', 'take', 'heel', 'run', 'I', 'hear', 'pound', 'behind', 'I', 'run', 'quick', 'keep', 'eye', 'fix', 'white', 'stone', 'show', 'step', 'moon', 'night', 'and', 'suddenly', 'foot', 'feel', 'nothingness', 'I', 'hear', 'man', 'behind', 'laugh', 'evil', 'sinister', 'laugh', 'it', 'ring', 'ear', 'I', 'fall', 'headlong', 'destruction', 'far', 'beneath']"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,1,"I came to myself slowly and painfully. I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling—falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine—a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out. Then dreams again—long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him—warn him—what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger—some great danger—and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. . . . By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window.

Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak still, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die like this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new look in his eyes. “Don’t cry, Anne. Please don’t cry. You’re safe now. No one shall hurt you.” He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. “Drink some of this milk.” I drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child. “Don’t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You’ll be stronger by and by. I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop!

Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do—do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.” “That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel—but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.” I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair.

Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and mostly I do as I please.” “You live here all alone?” “I am not pining for society, I assure you,” he replied coldly. “I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,” I retorted, “but I seem to have had very little to say in the matter.” To my surprise his eyes twinkled a little. “None whatever. I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal and carried you to my boat. Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.” “But for a different reason,” I put in. _He_ flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face was suffused. “But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless—disturbed—had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you—but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends?

To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted. “I shouldn’t dream of marrying any one unless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn’t like for the sake of some one she _does_ like. And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it.” “I’m afraid I disagree with you.

Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated. On the other hand, men don’t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!” Harry laughed outright. “What a cat and dog life you will lead.” “Lovers always fight,” I assured him. “Because they don’t understand each other. And by the time they do understand each other they aren’t in love any more.” “Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always lovers?” “I—I don’t know,” I said, momentarily confused. He turned away to the fireplace. “Like some more soup?” he asked in a casual tone. “Yes, please. I’m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.” “That’s good.” He busied himself with the fire; I watched. “When I can get off the couch, I’ll cook for you,” I promised. “I don’t suppose you know anything about cooking.” “I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,” I retorted, pointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece. _“Touché,”_ he said, and laughed.

They will hardly be surprised at not finding the body. It would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks and carried down with the torrent.” I shivered. “Once you are completely restored to health, you can journey quietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.” “That would be very tame,” I objected scornfully. “There speaks a foolish schoolgirl.” “I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.” He looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up flushed and excited. “God help me, so you are,” he muttered, and went abruptly out. My recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that it was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering the use of it quite quickly. It was a strange time. We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been—but with what a difference! Old Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have done.

3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,8,"but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I could never have believed possible. That—and something else. The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let me go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by himself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was sinking. Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my knees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation. I felt rather than saw Harry looking at me. “You look like a witch, Anne,” he said at last, and there was something in his voice that had never been there before. He reached out his hand and just touched my hair. I shivered. Suddenly he sprang up with an oath. “You must leave here to-morrow, do you hear?” he cried. “I—I can’t bear any more. I’m only a man after all. You must go, Anne. You must. You’re not a fool. You know yourself that this can’t go on.” “I suppose not,” I said slowly. “But—it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that—laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay—I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that.","['grow', 'we', 'real', 'lasting', 'comradeship', 'I', 'could', 'never', 'believe', 'possible', 'that', 'something', 'else', 'the', 'time', 'draw', 'near', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'well', 'enough', 'leave', 'I', 'realize', 'heavy', 'heart', 'be', 'go', 'let', 'go', 'without', 'word', 'without', 'sign', 'he', 'fit', 'silence', 'long', 'moody', 'interval', 'moment', 'would', 'spring', 'tramp', 'one', 'evening', 'crisis', 'come', 'we', 'finish', 'simple', 'meal', 'sit', 'doorway', 'hut', 'the', 'sun', 'sink', 'hairpin', 'necessity', 'life', 'Harry', 'able', 'provide', 'hair', 'straight', 'black', 'hang', 'knee', 'I', 'sit', 'chin', 'hand', 'lose', 'meditation', 'I', 'feel', 'rather', 'see', 'Harry', 'look', 'you', 'look', 'like', 'witch', 'Anne', 'say', 'last', 'something', 'voice', 'never', 'he', 'reach', 'hand', 'touch', 'hair', 'I', 'shiver', 'suddenly', 'spring', 'oath', 'you', 'must', 'leave', 'morrow', 'hear', 'cry', 'I', 'I', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'I', '’m', 'man', 'you', 'must', 'go', 'Anne', 'you', 'must', 'you', '’re', 'fool', 'you', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'I', 'suppose', 'I', 'say', 'slowly', 'but', '’s', 'happy', 'n’t', 'Happy', 'it', '’s', 'hell', 'as', 'bad', 'what', 'torment', 'why', 'mock', 'why', 'say', 'laugh', 'hair', 'I', 'n’t', 'laugh', 'and', 'I', '’m', 'mock', 'if', 'want', 'go', 'I', '’ll', 'go', 'but', 'want', 'stay', 'i’ll', 'stay', 'not', 'cry', 'vehemently', 'not']"

They know me here as Harry Parker—they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together—and then the blow will fall. You’re so young, Anne, and so beautiful—with the kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world’s before you—love, life, everything.

His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge. He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story—from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated—not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him.

He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly. “I—don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I _did_ love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now—when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow——” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes—young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience—he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life—a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track—and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend.

I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find—you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was—Harry Rayburn.” “Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley—very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then—in the hotel at Kimberley—we met her——” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg—that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us—but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship.

Delilah—that’s what she should have been called—and she played her part well! “The De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the police came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed at first—the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were produced in court—and without question they were the stones stolen from De Beers’. Anita Grünberg had disappeared. She had effected the substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not the stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn. “Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed—but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief. He came out furious from the interview—his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened.

I had been madly in love with her for the moment—I even think that I frightened her sometimes—but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe—and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead. All I felt was, ‘What’s the good?’ My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I was supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy—numbed of all feeling. I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect of the war. “And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation.

I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told me—and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair—so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him.

Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow.

I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge, and it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age. I avoided Carton carefully on board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under the pretence of illness. “I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went straight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day. He left the hotel shortly before one o’clock. I was behind him. He went straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina—whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life—and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner.

3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,8,"I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films—which I must have dropped somewhere later—and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the _Kilmorden_ Castle.

3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,9,"I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart—and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room—God! It was horrible. Dead—and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country. “I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move.

The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.” “Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence—but he certainly never went _there._ I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved. Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the _Kilmorden Castle_—that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger—hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them—if he did hide them, I don’t know.” “That’s another story,” I quoted. _“My_ story.

3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,1,"Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession—or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement—or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in her own brain, and the “Colonel” was not likely to guess that they had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward! Harry’s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured. It was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities. For, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove his case. The one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity of the “Colonel.” Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett? “I should say he was but for one thing,” said Harry. “It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow—and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed","['Harry', 'listen', 'attentively', 'whilst', 'I', 'recount', 'event', 'I', 'narrate', 'page', 'the', 'thing', 'bewilder', 'astonish', 'find', 'along', 'diamond', 'possession', 'rather', 'Suzanne', '’s', 'that', 'fact', 'never', 'suspect', 'of', 'course', 'hear', 'story', 'I', 'realize', 'point', 'Carton', '’s', 'little', 'arrangement', 'rather', 'Nadina', '’s', 'since', 'I', 'doubt', 'brain', 'conceive', 'plan', 'no', 'surprise', 'tactic', 'execute', 'husband', 'could', 'result', 'seizure', 'diamond', 'the', 'secret', 'lock', 'brain', 'Colonel', 'likely', 'guess', 'entrust', 'keeping', 'ocean', 'steward', 'Harry', '’s', 'vindication', 'old', 'charge', 'theft', 'seem', 'assure', 'it', 'graver', 'charge', 'paralyze', 'activity', 'for', 'thing', 'stand', 'could', 'come', 'open', 'prove', 'case', 'the', 'one', 'thing', 'come', 'back', 'identity', 'Colonel', 'be', 'Guy', 'Pagett', 'I', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'say', 'Harry', 'it', 'seem', 'pretty', 'much', 'certainty', 'Pagett', 'murder', 'Anita', 'Grünberg', 'Marlow', 'certainly', 'lend', 'colour', 'supposition', 'actually', 'Colonel', 'since', 'Anita', '’s', 'business', 'nature', 'discuss']"

You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town—by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who could have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of that note being written.” We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: “You say that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel Race?” “I could not find him anywhere.” “Had he any reason to believe that—you and I might be friendly with each other?” “He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the ‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the Secret Service.” “How do we know that he is?

Anne, do you like Race?” “I do—and I don’t. He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.” “He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,” said Harry slowly. “But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he had been in Paris trying to get on his track.” _“Camouflage_—of a particularly clever kind.” “But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?” “Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that night on the _Kilmorden?”_ “Yes—through Sir Eustace.” I repeated it. Harry listened closely. “He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door.

Wouldn’t he take it for granted that I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?” “It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas. And there are other things.” “Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man might have merely asked him the time.” “It was just a coincidence, you mean?” “Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would _he_ have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?” “Then you think he may be entirely innocent?” “It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow.

I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours. At last he called me: “Come, Anne, it’s time to go.” I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. “We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat——” Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. “Hush! What’s that?” I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too—the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage.

By its light I recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at Muizenberg. The others were natives. “Quick—back to the hut.” Harry swept me back with him. He took down a couple of rifles and a revolver from the wall. “Can you load a rifle?” “I never have. Show me how.” I grasped his instructions well enough. We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it.

They’re routed for the moment—but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion. Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why—where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See—they’ve got two boat-loads this time.

Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes—stuffed with rags—but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. “We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boat——too many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side for Livingstone.” “I can swim a little—farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?” For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?” “No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp, Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.” “Crocodiles?” “Yes, don’t think of them—or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.” We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns.

How he did it for all that way, I don’t know. The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned—perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever.

It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough.

I yearn for a quiet life—and that’s just the one thing I don’t seem able to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going.

She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done—but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep.

Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves—that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg.

It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last.

Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm.

The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value.

To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi—if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the _Kilmorden,_ last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different.

Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered _fortissimo_ and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery. When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa.

His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far. “There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them.

In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me—I know what happens in a case of that kind.

No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully. “Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary——” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers—for which I shall be hauled over the coals—and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town.

I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment. “He’s been with me eight years—a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught _me_ coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once—and in rather doubtful circumstances. I may as well tell you—in confidence, Sir Eustace—that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady.

3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off _en route._ I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me—I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully, when I had finished. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you. Oh, Anne, dear, don’t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is telling the truth?

I don’t see that there’s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.” I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. “Just because you’re comfortably married and getting fat, you’ve forgotten that there’s any such thing as romance,” I ended. “Oh, I’m not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I’ve had about you lately must have worn me to a shred.” “You look particularly well nourished,” I said coldly. “I should say you must have put on about half a stone.” “And I don’t know that I’m so comfortably married either,” continued Suzanne in a melancholy voice. “I’ve been having the most dreadful cables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once.

I turned the conversation to the subject of the diamonds. Suzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw. “I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect Colonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds. I wanted to stay on at the Falls in case he might have kidnapped you somewhere close by, but didn’t know what to do about the diamonds. I was afraid to keep them in my possession——” Suzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared the walls might have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear. “A distinctly good idea,” I approved. “At the time, that is. It’s a bit awkward now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?” “The big ones were sent down to Cape Town.","['fortnight', 'I', '’m', 'afraid', 'I', 'not', 'take', 'Suzanne', '’s', 'matrimonial', 'trouble', 'seriously', 'she', 'able', 'get', 'round', 'Clarence', 'right', 'time', 'come', 'I', 'turn', 'conversation', 'subject', 'diamond', 'Suzanne', 'look', 'drop', 'jaw', 'I', 'must', 'explain', 'Anne', 'you', 'see', 'soon', 'I', 'begin', 'suspect', 'Colonel', 'Race', 'I', 'terribly', 'upset', 'diamond', 'I', 'want', 'stay', 'Falls', 'case', 'might', 'kidnap', 'somewhere', 'close', 'not', 'know', 'diamond', 'I', 'afraid', 'keep', 'possession', 'Suzanne', 'look', 'round', 'uneasily', 'though', 'fear', 'wall', 'might', 'ear', 'whisper', 'vehemently', 'ear', 'a', 'distinctly', 'good', 'idea', 'I', 'approve', 'at', 'time', 'it', '’', 'bit', 'awkward', 'what', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'case', 'the', 'big', 'one', 'send', 'Cape', 'Town']"

He’s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I see,” I said thoughtfully. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.” I turned the matter over in my mind. “Well,” I said at last, “it’s awkward—but it’s safe enough. We’d better do nothing for the present.” Suzanne looked at me with a little smile. “You don’t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?” “Not very much,” I replied honestly. The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I found that it would arrive at 5.40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6.

3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,5,"good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got another chance. The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name I dislike exceedingly. There was clearly nothing to be done until I could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental over him. In her way—which of course is quite different from me and Harry—she is really fond of Clarence. “I do wish he was here, Anne,” she gulped. “It’s such a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I said soothingly.

He’d be shyer speaking before two of us.” So it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit.

Everybody tumbled out on the platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no difficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his usual nervous start at seeing me—somewhat accentuated this time. “Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.” “I have reappeared again,” I told him solemnly. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Very well, thank you—looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there is something I want to ask you. I hope that you won’t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you can possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last?” He started violently. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld—I—indeed——” “You _were_ there, weren’t you?” “I—for reasons of","['blow', 'solemnly', 'assure', 'it', 'sound', 'cheerful', 'the', 'train', 'draw', 'ten', 'minute', 'late', 'everybody', 'tumble', 'platform', 'begin', 'walk', 'feverishly', 'I', 'difficulty', 'espy', 'Pagett', 'I', 'accost', 'eagerly', 'he', 'give', 'usual', 'nervous', 'start', 'see', 'somewhat', 'accentuate', 'time', 'dear', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'I', 'understand', 'disappear', 'I', 'reappear', 'I', 'tell', 'solemnly', 'and', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'very', 'well', 'thank', 'look', 'forward', 'take', 'work', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'I', 'say', 'something', 'I', 'want', 'ask', 'I', 'hope', 'will', 'not', 'offend', 'lot', 'hang', 'possibly', 'guess', 'I', 'want', 'know', 'Marlow', '8th', 'January', 'last', 'he', 'start', 'violently', 'really', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'i', 'indeed', 'you', 'n’t', 'I', 'reason']"

Does he know?” “I am almost sure that he does. I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, Miss Beddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts. Possibly he has known them for years.” I hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what Pagett was talking about.

3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,9,"put himself in my position. I know that I was in the wrong, but it seemed a harmless deception. I would have thought it better taste on his part to have tackled me outright—instead of indulging in covert jokes at my expense.” A whistle blew, and the people began to surge back into the train. “Yes, Mr. Pagett,” I broke in, “I’m sure I quite agree with all you’re saying about Sir Eustace. _But why did you go to Marlow?”_ “It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances—yes, I still feel natural under the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I cried desperately. For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me. “I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see your concern in the","['put', 'position', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'wrong', 'seem', 'harmless', 'deception', 'I', 'would', 'think', 'well', 'taste', 'part', 'tackle', 'outright', 'instead', 'indulge', 'covert', 'joke', 'expense', 'a', 'whistle', 'blew', 'people', 'begin', 'surge', 'back', 'train', 'yes', 'Mr.', 'Pagett', 'I', 'break', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'I', 'quite', 'agree', '’re', 'say', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'but', 'go', 'Marlow', 'it', 'wrong', 'natural', 'circumstance', 'yes', 'I', 'still', 'feel', 'natural', 'circumstance', 'what', 'circumstance', 'I', 'cry', 'desperately', 'for', 'first', 'time', 'Pagett', 'seem', 'recognize', 'I', 'ask', 'question', 'his', 'mind', 'detach', 'peculiarity', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'justification', 'come', 'rest', 'I', 'beg', 'pardon', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'say', 'stiffly', 'I', 'fail', 'see', 'concern']"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,10,"matter.” He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt desperate. What could one do with a man like that? “Of course, if it’s so dreadful that you’d be ashamed to speak of it to me——” I began spitefully. At last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand you.” “Then tell me.” In three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett’s secret! It was not in the least what I expected. I walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me. I tore it open. It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking.","['matter', 'he', 'back', 'train', 'lean', 'speak', 'I', 'feel', 'desperate', 'what', 'could', 'one', 'man', 'like', 'of', 'course', '’', 'dreadful', '’d', 'ashamed', 'speak', 'I', 'begin', 'spitefully', 'at', 'last', 'I', 'find', 'right', 'stop', 'Pagett', 'stiffen', 'flushed', 'dreadful', 'Ashamed', 'I', 'not', 'understand', 'then', 'tell', 'in', 'three', 'short', 'sentence', 'tell', 'at', 'last', 'I', 'know', 'Pagett', '’s', 'secret', 'it', 'least', 'I', 'expect', 'I', 'walk', 'slowly', 'back', 'hotel', 'there', 'wire', 'hand', 'I', 'tear', 'open', 'it', 'contain', 'full', 'definite', 'instruction', 'proceed', 'forthwith', 'Johannesburg', 'rather', 'station', 'side', 'Johannesburg', 'I', 'meet', 'car', 'it', 'sign', 'Andy', 'Harry', 'I', 'sit', 'chair', 'serious', 'thinking']"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,1,"_(From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_ Johannesburg, _March 7th._ Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria. Then, when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort. I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter. I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong—it always does—and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten Pagett’s powers of being in the right. “I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace. The typewriter is in perfect condition.” “What do you mean—all the cases?” “The two small cases as well.” “I wish you","['from', 'diary', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'Pedler', 'Johannesburg', 'March', '7th', 'Pagett', 'arrive', 'he', 'blue', 'funk', 'course', 'suggest', 'go', 'Pretoria', 'then', 'I', 'tell', 'kindly', 'firmly', 'go', 'remain', 'go', 'extreme', 'wish', 'rifle', 'begin', 'buck', 'bridge', 'guard', 'Great', 'War', 'a', 'railway', 'bridge', 'Little', 'Puddecombe', 'junction', 'something', 'sort', 'I', 'soon', 'cut', 'short', 'tell', 'unpack', 'big', 'typewriter', 'I', 'think', 'would', 'keep', 'employ', 'time', 'typewriter', 'sure', 'go', 'wrong', 'always', 'would', 'take', 'somewhere', 'mend', 'but', 'I', 'forget', 'Pagett', '’s', 'power', 'right', 'I', '’ve', 'already', 'unpack', 'case', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'the', 'typewriter', 'perfect', 'condition', 'what', 'mean', 'case', 'the', 'two', 'small', 'case', 'well', 'I', 'wish']"

He hates to make a mistake. “So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last chance.” I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning, at any rate. “There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.” “I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily. “At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur—hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train.

Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it was too late. Pagett was on the war-path.

The roll of films being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night by some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play. I told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again. He tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before I could make head or tail of this one. I did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming over with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have cared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace.

What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop——” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.” “I waited outside for ages—but they didn’t come out. At last I went in. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be another way out.” I stared at him. “As I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries about Miss Pettigrew.” Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard as he always does when he wants to be confidential. “Sir Eustace, a man was seen coming out of her room last night.” I raised my eyebrows. “And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,” I murmured. Pagett went on without heeding. “I went straight up and searched her room. What do you think I found?” I shook my head. “This!” Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick","['I', '’ve', 'make', 'inquiry', 'wait', 'bit', 'what', 'happen', 'Rayburn', 'he', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'go', 'corner', 'curio', 'shop', 'I', 'utter', 'involuntary', 'exclamation', 'Pagett', 'stop', 'inquiringly', 'nothing', 'I', 'say', 'go', 'I', 'wait', 'outside', 'age', 'not', 'come', 'at', 'last', 'I', 'go', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'one', 'shop', 'there', 'must', 'another', 'way', 'I', 'stare', 'as', 'I', 'say', 'I', 'come', 'back', 'hotel', 'make', 'inquiry', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'Pagett', 'lower', 'voice', 'breathe', 'hard', 'always', 'want', 'confidential', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'man', 'see', 'come', 'room', 'last', 'night', 'I', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'and', 'I', 'always', 'regard', 'lady', 'eminent', 'respectability', 'I', 'murmur', 'Pagett', 'go', 'without', 'heed', 'I', 'go', 'straight', 'search', 'room', 'what', 'think', 'I', 'find', 'I', 'shake', 'head', 'this', 'Pagett', 'hold', 'safety', 'razor', 'stick']"

Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even Pagett has his limits. “You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to _this?”_ I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly. “It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully. “It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.” “Indeed,” I commented. “Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise?” “Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am.

I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have found me out.” At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed! “Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly. “Much the best way.” “Thank you, Sir Eustace.” “Is it her husband? Annoying fellows, husbands. Always turning up when they’re least expected.” “I fail to follow you, Sir Eustace. Whose husband?” “The lady’s husband.” “What lady?” “God bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence. There must have been a lady. Don’t tell me that you merely robbed a church or stabbed an Italian in the back because you didn’t like his face.” “I am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace.

I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary. I did not want to lose the post. A resident secretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the fact.” “You take my breath away,” I remarked. “Where has she been all these years?” “We have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close to the Mill House, for over five years.” “God bless my soul,” I muttered. “Any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along, that a man like Pagett couldn’t have a guilty secret. The respectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That’s just the kind of secret he would have—a wife and four children. “Have you told this to","['I', 'not', 'know', 'marry', 'no', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'tell', 'I', 'deceive', 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'marry', 'just', 'eight', 'year', 'I', 'marry', 'six', 'month', 'I', 'become', 'secretary', 'I', 'want', 'lose', 'post', 'a', 'resident', 'secretary', 'suppose', 'wife', 'I', 'suppress', 'fact', 'you', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'I', 'remark', 'where', 'year', 'we', 'small', 'bungalow', 'river', 'Marlow', 'quite', 'close', 'Mill', 'House', 'five', 'year', 'God', 'bless', 'soul', 'I', 'mutter', 'any', 'child', 'four', 'child', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'I', 'gaze', 'kind', 'stupor', 'I', 'might', 'know', 'along', 'man', 'like', 'Pagett', 'could', 'not', 'guilty', 'secret', 'the', 'respectability', 'Pagett', 'always', 'bane', 'that', '’', 'kind', 'secret', 'would', 'wife', 'four', 'child', 'have', 'tell']"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,10,"any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands. “Can I show you something? Furs, curios?” “I want something quite out of the ordinary,” I said. “It’s for a special occasion. Will you show me what you’ve got?” “Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties there?” That is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so clever.

3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ I had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I got my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell. I arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He had a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. “Guns,” he answered laconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo’burg! I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting time. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building. The door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter. I stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and threw open a door. “The young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,” he said, and laughed. Thus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and smelt of cheap tobacco smoke. Behind a desk a man sat writing. He looked up and raised his eyebrows. “Dear me,” he said, “if it isn’t Miss Beddingfeld!” “I must be seeing double,” I apologized. “Is it Mr. Chichester, or is it Miss Pettigrew? There is an extraordinary resemblance to both of them.” “Both characters are in abeyance for the moment. I have doffed my petticoats—and my cloth likewise. Won’t you sit down?” I accepted a seat composedly. “It would seem,” I remarked, “that I have come to the wrong address.” “From your point of view, I am afraid you have. Really, Miss Beddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!” “It was not very bright of me,” I admitted meekly. Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him. “You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,” he remarked dryly. “Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?”","['Anne', '’s', 'Narrative', 'Resumed', 'I', 'great', 'trouble', 'Suzanne', 'she', 'argue', 'plead', 'even', 'weep', 'would', 'let', 'carry', 'plan', 'but', 'end', 'I', 'get', 'way', 'she', 'promise', 'carry', 'instruction', 'letter', 'come', 'station', 'bid', 'tearful', 'farewell', 'I', 'arrive', 'destination', 'follow', 'morning', 'early', 'I', 'meet', 'short', 'black', 'bearded', 'Dutchman', 'I', 'never', 'see', 'he', 'car', 'wait', 'drive', 'there', 'queer', 'boom', 'distance', 'I', 'ask', 'gun', 'answer', 'laconically', 'so', 'fight', 'go', 'Jo’burg', 'I', 'gather', 'objective', 'spot', 'somewhere', 'suburb', 'city', 'we', 'turn', 'twist', 'make', 'several', 'detour', 'get', 'every', 'minute', 'gun', 'nearer', 'it', 'exciting', 'time', 'at', 'last', 'stop', 'somewhat', 'ramshackle', 'building', 'the', 'door', 'open', 'Kafir', 'boy', 'my', 'guide', 'sign', 'enter', 'I', 'stand', 'irresolute', 'dingy', 'square', 'hall', 'the', 'man', 'pass', 'throw', 'open', 'door', 'the', 'young', 'lady', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Harry', 'Rayburn', 'say', 'laugh', 'thus', 'announce', 'I', 'pass', 'the', 'room', 'sparsely', 'furnish', 'smell', 'cheap', 'tobacco', 'smoke', 'behind', 'desk', 'man', 'sit', 'write', 'he', 'look', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'dear', 'say', 'n’t', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'I', 'must', 'see', 'double', 'I', 'apologize', 'be', 'Mr.', 'Chichester', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'there', 'extraordinary', 'resemblance', 'both', 'character', 'abeyance', 'moment', 'I', 'doff', 'petticoat', 'cloth', 'likewise', 'will', 'not', 'sit', 'I', 'accept', 'seat', 'composedly', 'it', 'would', 'seem', 'I', 'remark', 'I', 'come', 'wrong', 'address', 'from', 'point', 'view', 'I', 'afraid', 'really', 'Miss', 'Beddingfeld', 'fall', 'trap', 'second', 'time', 'it', 'bright', 'I', 'admit', 'meekly', 'something', 'manner', 'seem', 'puzzle', 'you', 'hardly', 'seem', 'upset', 'occurrence', 'remark', 'dryly', 'would', 'go', 'heroic', 'effect', 'upon']"

Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all. “I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned—a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil——” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To——” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I—I—excuse me——” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly. Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return.

He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural. “Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor—but a fool. That was Minks you saw downstairs.” “Oh, really,” I said feebly. “And now,” said Sir Eustace cheerfully, “let’s get down to facts. How long have you known that I was the ‘Colonel’?” “Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. “Yes, I told the fool he’d blinking well torn it. He didn’t understand of course. His whole mind was set on whether _I’d_ recognized _him._ It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real—that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,”_ I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do.

3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,4,"all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went—told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms—heavily paid for—to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt. I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind—I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop—and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped.","['plan', 'bring', 'naught', 'chit', 'girl', 'I', 'think', 'plan', 'Falls', 'really', 'clever', 'I', 'say', 'endeavour', 'look', 'thing', 'detached', 'fashion', 'I', 'would', 'ready', 'swear', 'anywhere', 'hotel', 'I', 'go', 'seeing', 'believe', 'future', 'yes', 'Minks', 'one', 'great', 'success', 'Miss', 'Pettigrew', 'imitate', 'voice', 'quite', 'creditably', 'there', 'one', 'thing', 'I', 'like', 'know', 'yes', 'how', 'induce', 'Pagett', 'engage', 'oh', 'quite', 'simple', 'she', 'meet', 'Pagett', 'doorway', 'Trade', 'Commissioner', '’s', 'office', 'Chamber', 'Mines', 'wherever', 'go', 'tell', 'I', 'phone', 'hurry', 'select', 'Government', 'department', 'question', 'Pagett', 'swallow', 'like', 'lamb', 'you', '’re', 'frank', 'I', 'say', 'study', 'there', '’', 'earthly', 'reason', 'I', 'not', 'I', 'not', 'quite', 'like', 'sound', 'I', 'hasten', 'put', 'interpretation', 'you', 'believe', 'success', 'Revolution', 'you', '’ve', 'burn', 'boat', 'for', 'otherwise', 'intelligent', 'young', 'woman', '’', 'singularly', 'unintelligent', 'remark', 'no', 'dear', 'child', 'I', 'believe', 'Revolution', 'I', 'give', 'couple', 'day', 'long', 'fizzle', 'ignominiously', 'not', 'one', 'success', 'fact', 'I', 'say', 'nastily', 'like', 'woman', '’ve', 'idea', 'business', 'the', 'job', 'I', 'take', 'supply', 'certain', 'explosive', 'arm', 'heavily', 'pay', 'foment', 'feeling', 'generally', 'incriminate', 'certain', 'people', 'hilt', 'I', '’ve', 'carry', 'contract', 'complete', 'success', 'I', 'careful', 'pay', 'advance', 'I', 'take', 'special', 'care', 'whole', 'thing', 'I', 'intend', 'last', 'contract', 'retire', 'business', 'as', 'burn', 'boat', 'call', 'I', 'simply', 'not', 'know', 'mean', 'I', '’m', 'rebel', 'chief', 'anything', 'kind', 'I’m', 'distinguished', 'English', 'visitor', 'misfortune', 'go', 'nose', 'certain', 'curio', 'shop', 'see', 'little', 'mean', 'poor', 'fellow', 'kidnap']"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,5,"To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.” “Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here—I don’t want to rub it in in any way—but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you—and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself—is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes—don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much—first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two have half the brains that I have. I’m such an easy person to underestimate.” I think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize it. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him—and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver.

The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? “The fact of the matter is,” Sir Eustace was continuing, “I’ve a weakness for you. I really don’t want to proceed to extremes. Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind—I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that—at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives. You’ve had amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs up against the professional and then the result is a foregone conclusion. I am the professional. I started on this business when I was quite a youngster. All things considered, it seemed to me a good way of getting rich quickly. I always could think things out, and devise ingenious schemes—and I never made the mistake of trying to carry out my schemes myself. Always employ the expert—that has been my motto. The one time I departed from it I came to grief—but I couldn’t trust any one to do that job for me. Nadina knew too much.

Once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I’ve come to the conclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his wife and family! My fault—it tickled my sense of humour to employ the fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner’s face and his mid-Victorian soul. A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him. His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him——” “I won’t do anything of the kind.” “Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too—on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl.

I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you. Not a word to any one. Sir Eustace stopped. “I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,” he remarked. “But be careful to make no mistakes.” “‘Yours for ever and ever, Anne,’ will be sufficient,” I remarked. I wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. “That seems all right. Now the address.” I gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew, _alias_ Minks, answered the summons. “This letter is to go immediately—the usual route.” “Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks.

What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.” “Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made—I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too—I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the _Kilmorden_—either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the _Kilmorden_ I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out.

With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War—and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after _me!_ I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place.","['read', '17.1.22', 'instead', '1.71.22', 'the', 'thing', 'I', 'n’t', 'know', 'Minks', 'get', 'Cabin', '17', 'it', 'must', 'sheer', 'instinct', 'and', 'dispatch', 'General', 'smut', 'who', 'tamper', 'my', 'dear', 'Anne', 'not', 'suppose', 'I', 'go', 'lot', 'plan', 'give', 'away', 'without', 'make', 'effort', 'save', 'with', 'escape', 'murderer', 'secretary', 'I', 'hesitation', 'whatever', 'substitute', 'blank', 'nobody', 'would', 'think', 'suspect', 'poor', 'old', 'Pedler', 'what', 'Colonel', 'race', 'yes', 'nasty', 'jar', 'when', 'Pagett', 'tell', 'Secret', 'Service', 'fellow', 'I', 'unpleasant', 'feeling', 'spine', 'I', 'remember', '’d', 'nose', 'around', 'Nadina', 'Paris', 'War', 'I', 'horrible', 'suspicion', 'I', 'n’t', 'like', 'way', '’', 'stuck', 'ever', 'since', 'he', '’', 'one', 'strong', 'silent', 'man', 'always', 'get', 'something', 'sleeve', 'a', 'whistle', 'sound', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'pick', 'tube', 'listen', 'minute', 'two', 'answer', 'very', 'well', 'I', '’ll', 'see', 'business', 'remark', 'Miss', 'Anne', 'let', 'show', 'room', 'he', 'usher', 'small', 'shabby', 'apartment', 'Kafir', 'boy', 'bring', 'small', 'suit', 'case', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'urge', 'ask', 'anything', 'I', 'want', 'withdraw', 'picture', 'courteous', 'host', 'a', 'hot', 'water', 'washstand', 'I', 'proceed', 'unpack', 'necessary', 'something', 'hard', 'unfamiliar', 'sponge', 'bag', 'puzzle', 'greatly', 'I', 'untie', 'string', 'look', 'inside', 'to', 'utter', 'amazement', 'I', 'draw', 'small', 'pearl', 'handle', 'revolver', 'it', 'not', 'I', 'start', 'Kimberley', 'I', 'examine', 'thing', 'gingerly', 'it', 'appear', 'load', 'I', 'handle', 'comfortable', 'feeling', 'it', 'useful', 'thing', 'house', 'but', 'modern', 'clothe', 'quite', 'unsuited', 'carrying', 'fire', 'arm', 'in', 'end', 'I', 'push', 'gingerly', 'top', 'stocking', 'it', 'make', 'terrible', 'bulge', 'I', 'expect', 'every', 'minute', 'would', 'go', 'shoot', 'leg', 'really', 'seem', 'place']"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,1,"I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something. There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports—I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task—the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls—though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to","['I', 'summon', 'Sir', 'Eustace', '’s', 'presence', 'late', 'afternoon', 'Eleven', 'o’clock', 'tea', 'substantial', 'lunch', 'serve', 'apartment', 'I', 'feel', 'fortified', 'conflict', 'Sir', 'Eustace', 'alone', 'he', 'walk', 'room', 'gleam', 'eye', 'restlessness', 'manner', 'escape', 'he', 'exultant', 'something', 'there', 'subtle', 'change', 'manner', 'towards', 'I', 'news', 'your', 'young', 'man', 'way', 'he', 'minute', 'moderate', 'transport', 'I', 'something', 'say', 'you', 'attempt', 'deceive', 'morning', 'I', 'warn', 'would', 'wise', 'stick', 'truth', 'certain', 'point', 'obey', 'then', 'run', 'rail', 'you', 'attempt', 'make', 'believe', 'diamond', 'Harry', 'Rayburn', '’s', 'possession', 'at', 'time', 'I', 'accept', 'statement', 'facilitate', 'task', 'task', 'induce', 'decoy', 'Harry', 'Rayburn', 'but', 'dear', 'Anne', 'diamond', 'possession', 'ever', 'since', 'I', 'leave', 'Falls', 'though', 'I', 'discover', 'fact', 'yesterday', 'you', 'know', 'I', 'gasp', 'it', 'may', 'interest']"

It didn’t take me long to put two and two together—Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I admit that I haven’t had time to examine them yet, but I notice that one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles in a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with seccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case seems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely in the trap. . . . It’s a pity that you didn’t take kindly to the idea of becoming Lady Pedler.” I did not answer.

That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room—and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. “Yes,” murmured the latter, “decidedly you are not lucky! This is—let me see, the third encounter.” “You are right,” said Harry. “This is the third encounter. Twice you have worsted me—have you never heard that the third time the luck changes?

If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger—don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart.

I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I——” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table. “The young are always so violent,” he said reproachfully. “Unable to use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk sense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of affairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are hopelessly outnumbered.

Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town.

But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her—and your record’s against you. You’re a thief, remember, a thief.

I don’t know what it’s all about.” “Don’t you? It means that I’ve found the ‘Colonel.’ It means that on January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned to do away with her—and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.” “Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information? From the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.” “We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.” Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks _alias_ the Rev.

I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me. He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds.

Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot.

Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.” This glimpse of a world unknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid little face light up as she talked.

Usually a couple of hours every day sees me through. It’s dull work too. In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian—an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man.

Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “Where’s my powder-puff?” She proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of lip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass, and betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness. “I say,” I hesitated. “I dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all that sort of thing?” The girl paused in her operations,","['I', 'devour', 'paper', 'do', 'remember', 'Styles', 'Case', 'I', 'ask', 'let', 'see', 'old', 'lady', 'poison', 'somewhere', 'Essex', 'I', 'nod', 'that', 'Poirot', '’s', 'first', 'big', 'case', 'undoubtedly', 'murderer', 'would', 'escape', 'scot', 'free', 'it', 'wonderful', 'bit', 'detective', 'work', 'warm', 'subject', 'I', 'run', 'head', 'affair', 'work', 'triumphant', 'unexpected', 'dénouement', 'the', 'girl', 'listen', 'spellbound', 'in', 'fact', 'absorb', 'train', 'draw', 'Calais', 'station', 'realize', 'my', 'goodness', 'gracious', 'cry', 'companion', 'where', '’', 'powder', 'puff', 'she', 'proceed', 'bedaub', 'face', 'liberally', 'apply', 'stick', 'lip', 'salve', 'lip', 'observe', 'effect', 'small', 'pocket', 'glass', 'betray', 'faint', 'sign', 'self', 'consciousness', 'I', 'say', 'I', 'hesitate', 'I', 'dare', 'say', '’', 'cheek', 'part', 'sort', 'thing', 'the', 'girl', 'pause', 'operation']"

Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.” “Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat.

It looked angry—revengeful.… “So good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone. “Aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” I cried, as she turned away. She looked over her shoulder.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,1,"It was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for breakfast on the following morning. My friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the shell of his second egg. He beamed upon me as I entered. “You have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so terrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning. _Pardon___, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange him.” Elsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little man! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to one side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military moustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in appearance. For neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. To see an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray in one’s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter. “Order” and “Method” were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “The true work, it is done from _within___. _The little grey cells___—remember always the little grey cells, _mon ami!___” I slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot’s greeting, that an hour’s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet “terrible.” Poirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark. “_Du tout!___ If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of the most terrible, one has lived many hours!

You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out of the rack, and held it up for me to examine. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we here? None.” “It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly. Poirot threw me a withering glance. “What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf—a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake!” I endeavoured to distract his mind. “Anything interesting come by the post?” Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air. “I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays.

The last problem that presented any interest was that intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond, and that was—how many months ago, my friend?” He shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter. “Cheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you know, there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.” Poirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which he opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes that lay by his plate. “A bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.” “Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case. “He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.” “How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp. “He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah—” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively.

He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!” He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, _mon ami___, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.” “Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.” Poirot nodded. “It is a quiet little place—but chic! It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?” “Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the country, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little about him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large South American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.” “Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us pack. A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.” “And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile. “Ah! _je m’en fiche!___ Her case was certainly not interesting.” “Why so sure of that?” “Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot wait—always remember that, Hastings.” Eleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover. Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast.

His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “_Quelle idée!___ You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.” “He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and fro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from within—_here___—” he tapped his forehead significantly. As usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty. “It’s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer.” “And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked Poirot dryly. “But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details—all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “_Eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You","['turn', 'reproachful', 'face', 'upon', 'be', 'forget', 'method', 'excellent', 'Laverguier', 'his', 'system', 'I', 'practise', 'always', 'one', 'balance', 'oneself', 'remember', 'turn', 'head', 'left', 'right', 'breathe', 'count', 'six', 'breath', 'H’m', 'I', 'demur', 'you', '’ll', 'rather', 'tired', 'balance', 'count', 'six', 'time', 'get', 'Santiago', 'Buenos', 'Ayres', 'wherever', 'land', 'Quelle', 'idée', 'you', 'figure', 'I', 'shall', 'go', 'Santiago', 'Mr.', 'Renauld', 'suggest', 'letter', 'he', 'know', 'method', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'I', 'run', 'fro', 'make', 'journey', 'agitate', 'my', 'work', 'do', 'within—_here', 'tap', 'forehead', 'significantly', 'as', 'usual', 'remark', 'rouse', 'argumentative', 'faculty', 'it', '’', 'well', 'Poirot', 'I', 'think', 'fall', 'habit', 'despise', 'certain', 'thing', 'much', 'a', 'finger', 'print', 'lead', 'sometimes', 'arrest', 'conviction', 'murderer', 'and', 'without', 'doubt', 'hang', 'one', 'innocent', 'man', 'remark', 'Poirot', 'dryly', 'but', 'surely', 'study', 'finger', 'print', 'footprint', 'cigarette', 'ash', 'different', 'kind', 'mud', 'clue', 'comprise', 'minute', 'observation', 'detail', 'vital', 'importance', 'but', 'certainly', 'I', 'never', 'say', 'otherwise', 'the', 'train', 'observer', 'expert', 'without', 'doubt', 'useful', 'but', 'other', 'Hercules', 'Poirots', 'expert', 'to', 'expert', 'bring', 'fact', 'business', 'method', 'crime', 'logical', 'deduction', 'proper', 'sequence', 'order', 'fact', 'true', 'psychology', 'case', 'you', 'hunt', 'fox', 'yes', 'I', 'hunt', 'bit', 'I', 'say', 'rather', 'bewilder', 'abrupt', 'change', 'subject', 'why', 'eh', 'bien', 'hunting', 'fox', 'need', 'dog', 'hound', 'I', 'correct', 'gently', 'yes', 'course', 'but', 'yet', 'Poirot', 'wag', 'finger', 'you']"

Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But _I___ should have wasted my time if _I___ had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air. On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais.

And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville. My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition—a _je ne sais quoi!___” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair—a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind.

There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “_Ça commence!___” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “_Mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I—” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing _sergent de ville___. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.” “But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, isn’t it?” “Yes, monsieur, but—” Poirot leaned forward. “But what?” “M.

Murdered? When? How?” The _sergent de ville___ drew himself up. “I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.” “True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?” “Yes, monsieur.” Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it. “_Voilà!___ Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The _sergent de ville___ saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex!

But come inside.” He held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M. Bex continued to talk: “The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most sympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.” “When was the crime committed?” asked Poirot. “The body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. Madame Renauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.” We had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the Villa. In the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting. He rose at sight of the commissary. “Where is M. Hautet now?” inquired the latter. “In the _salon___, monsieur.” M.

The commissary introduced us, and explained our presence. M.

He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.” “Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of","['commissary', 'finish', 'speak', 'you', 'letter', 'monsieur', 'Poirot', 'hand', 'magistrate', 'read', 'H’m', 'he', 'speak', 'secret', 'what', 'pity', 'explicit', 'we', 'much', 'indebted', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'I', 'hope', 'we', 'honour', 'assist', 'we', 'investigation', 'or', 'oblige', 'return', 'London', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'I', 'propose', 'remain', 'I', 'arrive', 'time', 'prevent', 'client', '’s', 'death', 'I', 'feel', 'bind', 'honour', 'discover', 'assassin', 'the', 'magistrate', 'bow', 'these', 'sentiment', 'honour', 'also', 'without', 'doubt', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'wish', 'retain', 'service', 'we', 'expect', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'Sûreté', 'Paris', 'moment', 'I', 'sure', 'able', 'give', 'mutual', 'assistance', 'investigation', 'in', 'meantime', 'I', 'hope', 'honour', 'present', 'interrogation', 'I', 'need', 'hardly', 'say', 'assistance', 'require', 'disposal', 'I', 'thank', 'monsieur', 'you', 'comprehend', 'present', 'I', 'completely', 'dark', 'I', 'know', 'nothing', 'whatever', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'nod', 'commissary', 'latter', 'take', 'tale', 'this', 'morning', 'old', 'servant', 'Françoise', 'descend', 'start', 'work', 'find', 'front', 'door', 'ajar', 'feel', 'momentary', 'alarm', 'burglar', 'look', 'dining', 'room', 'see', 'silver', 'safe', 'think', 'conclude', 'master', 'without', 'doubt', 'rise', 'early', 'go', 'stroll', 'Pardon', 'monsieur', 'interrupting', 'common', 'practice']"

Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, _in an open grave___.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug—just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead—how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants.

But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The _sergent de ville___ appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine—” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.” “What time would that be?” “The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.” “What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?” “Madame had retired some time","['but', 'without', 'doubt', 'awake', 'calm', 'equal', 'bear', 'strain', 'interrogation', 'the', 'commissary', 'pause', 'and', 'inmate', 'house', 'monsieur', 'there', 'old', 'françoise', 'housekeeper', 'live', 'many', 'year', 'former', 'owner', 'Villa', 'Geneviève', 'then', 'two', 'young', 'girl', 'sister', 'Denise', 'Léonie', 'Oulard', 'their', 'home', 'Merlinville', 'come', 'respectable', 'parent', 'then', 'chauffeur', 'M.', 'renauld', 'bring', 'England', 'away', 'holiday', 'finally', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'son', 'M.', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'he', 'away', 'home', 'present', 'Poirot', 'bow', 'head', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'speak', 'Marchaud', 'the', 'sergent', 'de', 'ville', 'appear', 'bring', 'woman', 'Françoise', 'the', 'man', 'salute', 'disappear', 'in', 'moment', 'two', 'return', 'escort', 'frightened', 'Françoise', 'you', 'name', 'Françoise', 'Arrichet', 'yes', 'monsieur', 'you', 'long', 'time', 'service', 'Villa', 'Geneviève', 'eleven', 'year', 'Madame', 'la', 'Vicomtesse', 'then', 'sell', 'Villa', 'spring', 'I', 'consent', 'remain', 'english', 'milor', 'never', 'I', 'imagine', 'the', 'magistrate', 'cut', 'short', 'without', 'doubt', 'without', 'doubt', 'now', 'Françoise', 'matter', 'front', 'door', 'whose', 'business', 'fasten', 'night', 'mine', 'monsieur', 'always', 'I', 'see', 'and', 'last', 'night', 'I', 'fasten', 'usual', 'you', 'sure', 'I', 'swear', 'bless', 'saint', 'monsieur', 'what', 'time', 'would', 'the', 'time', 'usual', 'half', 'past', 'ten', 'monsieur', 'what', 'rest', 'household', 'go', 'bed', 'Madame', 'retire', 'time']"

Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let _cette dame___ out—” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “_Cette dame?___ What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur—and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.” “Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police—the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil—from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “_Voilà,___” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining","['Denise', 'Léonie', 'go', 'Monsieur', 'still', 'study', 'then', 'one', 'unfasten', 'door', 'afterwards', 'must', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'Françoise', 'shrug', 'broad', 'shoulder', 'what', 'with', 'robber', 'assassin', 'pass', 'every', 'minute', 'a', 'nice', 'idea', 'Monsieur', 'imbecile', 'it', 'though', 'let', 'cette', 'dame', 'the', 'magistrate', 'interrupt', 'sharply', 'Cette', 'dame', 'what', 'lady', 'mean', 'why', 'lady', 'come', 'see', 'have', 'lady', 'see', 'evening', 'but', 'yes', 'monsieur', 'many', 'evening', 'well', 'who', 'do', 'know', 'a', 'rather', 'cunning', 'look', 'spread', 'woman', '’s', 'face', 'how', 'I', 'know', 'grumble', 'I', 'let', 'last', 'night', 'Aha', 'roar', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'bring', 'hand', 'bang', 'table', 'you', 'would', 'trifle', 'police', 'would', 'I', 'demand', 'tell', 'name', 'woman', 'come', 'visit', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'evening', 'the', 'police', 'police', 'grumble', 'Françoise', 'never', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'mix', 'police', 'but', 'I', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'it', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'the', 'commissary', 'utter', 'exclamation', 'lean', 'forward', 'though', 'utter', 'astonishment', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'Villa', 'Marguerite', 'road', 'that', 'I', 'say', 'monsieur', 'oh', 'pretty', 'one', 'cellela', 'the', 'old', 'woman', 'toss', 'head', 'scornfully', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'murmur', 'commissary', 'impossible', 'Voilà', 'grumble', 'Françoise', 'that', 'get', 'tell', 'truth', 'not', 'say', 'examining']"

Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were—” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?” “How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was _milor anglais___—_trés riche___—and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one—and _trés chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but _ma foi!___ I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend—all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this—friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable—most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. _Style anglais___, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M.

Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he","['hear', 'come', 'study', 'go', 'door', 'Monsieur', 'say', 'good', 'night', 'shut', 'door', 'what', 'time', 'about', 'twenty', 'five', 'minute', 'ten', 'monsieur', 'do', 'know', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'go', 'bed', 'I', 'hear', 'come', 'ten', 'minute', 'the', 'stair', 'creak', 'one', 'hear', 'every', 'one', 'go', 'and', 'you', 'hear', 'sound', 'disturbance', 'night', 'nothing', 'whatever', 'monsieur', 'which', 'servant', 'come', 'first', 'morning', 'I', 'monsieur', 'at', 'I', 'see', 'door', 'swinge', 'open', 'what', 'downstair', 'window', 'fasten', 'every', 'one', 'there', 'nothing', 'suspicious', 'place', 'anywhere', 'good', 'Françoise', 'go', 'the', 'old', 'woman', 'shuffle', 'towards', 'door', 'on', 'threshold', 'look', 'back', 'I', 'tell', 'one', 'thing', 'monsieur', 'that', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'bad', 'one', 'oh', 'yes', 'one', 'woman', 'know', 'another', 'she', 'bad', 'one', 'remember', 'and', 'shake', 'head', 'sagely', 'Françoise', 'leave', 'room', 'Léonie', 'Oulard', 'call', 'magistrate', 'Léonie', 'appeared', 'dissolve', 'tear', 'incline', 'hysterical', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'deal', 'adroitly', 'her', 'evidence', 'mainly', 'concern', 'discovery', 'mistress', 'gag', 'bind', 'give', 'rather', 'exaggerated', 'account', 'she', 'like', 'Françoise', 'hear', 'nothing', 'night', 'her', 'sister', 'Denise', 'succeed', 'she', 'agree', 'master', 'change', 'greatly', 'late', 'every', 'day', 'become', 'morose', 'he', 'eat', 'less', 'he', 'always', 'depressed', 'but', 'Denise', 'theory', 'without', 'doubt', 'Mafia']"

A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not _last___ night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady _did___ come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent—one can always tell it, _n’est-ce pas?___ Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: “‘Yeas—yeas—butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’” “Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,10,"It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, _voilà tout!___ So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday. A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own.

Bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting testimony. Which are we to believe, Françoise or Denise?” “Denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “It was she who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a dislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show that Renauld was entangled with another woman.” “_Tiens!___” cried M. Hautet. “We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “_My dearest one:___” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you?

Poirot handed it back with a grave face. “And the assumption is, M. le juge—?” The examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman—Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes—but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work—no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters.

A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically. “My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter—” “In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to the police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s life out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his friendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange if, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.” The commissary looked round for approval. “Excellent,” said Poirot appreciatively. “His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the magistrate. “You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So.

Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice—” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M.

If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands.

I am sorry that the body has been removed, but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.” “I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.” The commissary rose. “Come with me, monsieurs.” He opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him. Poirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” At last they got out into the hall. “That room there, it is the study, _hein?___” asked Poirot suddenly, nodding towards the door opposite. “Yes. You would like to see it?” He threw the door open as he spoke, and we entered. The room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike writing desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large leather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves lined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains and _portière___ were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone.

His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, _mon ami!___ And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. “The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it—eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled—and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “_Bien___,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by","['pass', 'hand', 'lightly', 'back', 'leather', 'chair', 'pick', 'magazine', 'table', 'draw', 'finger', 'gingerly', 'surface', 'oak', 'sideboard', 'his', 'face', 'express', 'complete', 'approval', 'no', 'dust', 'I', 'ask', 'smile', 'he', 'beam', 'appreciative', 'knowledge', 'peculiarity', 'not', 'particle', 'mon', 'ami', 'and', 'perhaps', 'pity', 'his', 'sharp', 'birdlike', 'eye', 'dart', 'ah', 'remark', 'suddenly', 'intonation', 'relief', 'the', 'hearth', 'rug', 'crook', 'bend', 'straighten', 'suddenly', 'utter', 'exclamation', 'rise', 'in', 'hand', 'hold', 'small', 'fragment', 'paper', 'in', 'France', 'England', 'remark', 'domestic', 'omit', 'sweep', 'mat', 'Bex', 'take', 'fragment', 'I', 'come', 'close', 'examine', 'you', 'recognize', 'eh', 'Hastings', 'I', 'shake', 'head', 'puzzle', 'yet', 'particular', 'shade', 'pink', 'paper', 'familiar', 'the', 'commissary', '’s', 'mental', 'process', 'quick', 'mine', 'a', 'fragment', 'cheque', 'exclaim', 'the', 'piece', 'paper', 'roughly', 'two', 'inch', 'square', 'on', 'write', 'ink', 'word', 'Duveen', 'Bien', 'say', 'Bex', 'this', 'cheque', 'payable', 'draw', 'one', 'name', 'Duveen', 'the', 'former', 'I', 'fancy', 'say', 'Poirot', 'I', 'mistaken', 'handwriting', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'that', 'soon', 'establish']"

My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘_Tiens!___ The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room _must___ have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M.

The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was—but how did you know?” “By _this___. I found it on the back of the leather chair.” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair—a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure.

His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “_Ma foi!___ but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.” “Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that.

It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method—either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position. “He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,” he remarked. “Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.” At this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after him. He strode forward and opened it. Françoise was there. She endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity. “Well, what is it?” demanded Bex impatiently. “Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate.” “Good,” said M. Bex briskly. “Tell M.

I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,1,"We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “_une maitresse femme___.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur.

It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed—upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door.

But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said. ‘_The secret!___ Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “_Pardon___,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room.

Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound—and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.” “How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman—M.

Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident—only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “_Mon Dieu!___” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished.

Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M.

That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.” “Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more.

Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then—she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that—blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes.

He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow. “_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification","['last', 'night', 'wire', 'catch', 'have', 'knowledge', 'business', 'Buenos', 'Ayres', 'no', 'monsieur', 'I', 'know', 'nothing', 'nature', 'Buenos', 'Ayres', 'son', '’s', 'final', 'destination', 'he', 'go', 'overland', 'Santiago', 'and', 'unison', 'magistrate', 'commissary', 'exclaim', 'Santiago', 'again', 'Santiago', 'it', 'moment', 'stun', 'mention', 'word', 'Poirot', 'approach', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'he', 'stand', 'window', 'like', 'man', 'lose', 'dream', 'I', 'doubt', 'fully', 'take', 'pass', 'he', 'pause', 'lady', '’s', 'side', 'bow', 'Pardon', 'madame', 'may', 'I', 'examine', 'wrist', 'though', 'slightly', 'surprised', 'request', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'hold', 'round', 'cruel', 'red', 'mark', 'cord', 'bite', 'flesh', 'as', 'examine', 'I', 'fancy', 'momentary', 'flicker', 'excitement', 'I', 'see', 'eye', 'disappear', 'they', 'must', 'cause', 'great', 'pain', 'say', 'look', 'puzzle', 'but', 'magistrate', 'speak', 'excitedly', 'Young', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'must', 'communicate', 'wireless', 'it', 'vital', 'know', 'anything', 'tell', 'we', 'trip', 'Santiago', 'he', 'hesitate', 'I', 'hope', 'might', 'near', 'hand', 'could', 'save', 'pain', 'madame', 'he', 'pause', 'you', 'mean', 'say', 'low', 'voice', 'identification']"

I am ready—now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you—” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside. He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,1,"Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “_Pauvre femme___,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.” “But all","['between', 'doctor', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'carry', 'unconscious', 'woman', 'house', 'the', 'commissary', 'look', 'shake', 'head', 'Pauvre', 'femme', 'murmur', 'the', 'shock', 'much', 'well', 'well', 'nothing', 'now', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'shall', 'visit', 'place', 'crime', 'commit', 'if', 'please', 'M.', 'Bex', 'we', 'pass', 'house', 'front', 'door', 'Poirot', 'look', 'staircase', 'pass', 'shake', 'head', 'dissatisfied', 'manner', 'it', 'incredible', 'servant', 'hear', 'nothing', 'the', 'creaking', 'staircase', 'three', 'people', 'descend', 'would', 'awaken', 'dead', 'it', 'middle', 'night', 'remember', 'they', 'sound', 'asleep', 'but', 'Poirot', 'continue', 'shake', 'head', 'though', 'fully', 'accept', 'explanation', 'on', 'sweep', 'drive', 'pause', 'look', 'house', 'what', 'move', 'first', 'place', 'try', 'front', 'door', 'open', 'it', 'unlikely', 'thing', 'it', 'far', 'probable', 'try', 'force', 'window', 'but']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,2,"the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere.

Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him—and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully.

Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.” I gave a gasp.

But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity. The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M.

But methods are very different now.” “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate—” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do.

Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.” “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?” The other detective stared. “Of course.” A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying. “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who used it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re Renauld’s too—or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces!

He touched it delicately with his finger. “And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question. Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared. “May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest me.” “I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly. I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and, if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground. Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed. “That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish.

Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.” Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and it vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at this juncture, he suddenly asked: “M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?” “No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there is here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.” “A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side, is it not?” I concurred. “You do not play the golf, M.

They, at least, are symmetrical.” I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no malice. Then he asked: “But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?” “Yes, he was a keen golfer. It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large subscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a say in the designing of it.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he remarked: “It was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body? When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been discovered.” “Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that _proves___ that they were strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body there—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered.

Bex excused himself for leaving us, explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining magistrate with the fact of Giraud’s arrival. Giraud himself had been obviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he wanted. The last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was Giraud, crawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that I could not but admire. Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically: “At last you have seen the detective you admire—the human foxhound! Is it not so, my friend?” “At any rate, he’s _doing___ something,” I said, with asperity. “If there’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you—” “_Eh bien!___ I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.” “Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that’s got nothing to do with it. I meant _little___ things—traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers.” “_Mon ami___, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping having nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told you so. No”—as I was about to interpose a question—“we will say no more. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems straightforward enough—and yet—and yet, _mon ami___, I am not satisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in. For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him.

Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if—” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you—to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they _were___. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.” We could say no more, for the old man had joined us. “You want me for something, monsieur?” “Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?” “Twenty-four years, monsieur.” “And your name is—?” “Auguste, monsieur.” “I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb. They have been planted long?” “Some time, monsieur.

Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize—” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study. “You think so? _Eh bien___, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “_Mon Dieu!___ But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, _mon ami___. At last I am on the right track.

That poor Giraud—I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language. I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind. “There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks—that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville—Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her.","['case', 'that', 'poor', 'Giraud', 'I', 'surprised', 'take', 'notice', 'whatever', 'at', 'moment', 'front', 'door', 'open', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'commissary', 'come', 'step', 'ah', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'come', 'look', 'say', 'magistrate', 'it', 'get', 'late', 'I', 'wish', 'pay', 'visit', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'without', 'doubt', 'much', 'upset', 'M.', 'Renauld', '’s', 'death', 'may', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'get', 'clue', 'the', 'secret', 'confide', 'wife', 'possible', 'may', 'tell', 'woman', 'whose', 'love', 'hold', 'enslave', 'we', 'know', 'samson', 'weak', 'n’t', 'I', 'admire', 'picturesqueness', 'M.', 'Hautet', '’s', 'language', 'I', 'suspect', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'part', 'mysterious', 'drama', 'be', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'go', 'accompany', 'we', 'ask', 'Poirot', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'show', 'clearly', 'prefer', 'conduct', 'case', 'way', 'say', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'dryly', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'easily', 'enough', 'Giraud', '’s', 'cavalier', 'treatment', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'prejudice', 'latter', 'favour', 'we', 'say', 'fall', 'line', 'Poirot', 'walk', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'commissary', 'I', 'follow', 'pace', 'behind', 'there', 'doubt', 'françoise', '’s', 'story', 'substantially', 'correct', 'remark', 'confidential', 'tone', 'I', 'telephone', 'headquarter', 'it', 'seem', 'three', 'time', 'last', 'six', 'week', 'say', 'since', 'arrival', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'Merlinville', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'pay', 'large', 'sum', 'note', 'banking', 'account', 'altogether', 'sum', 'total', 'two', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'franc', 'dear', 'I', 'say', 'consider', 'must', 'something', 'like', 'four', 'thousand', 'pound', 'precisely', 'yes', 'doubt', 'absolutely', 'infatuate', 'but', 'remain', 'see', 'whether', 'confide', 'secret']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,5,"The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One does not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about her, you comprehend.” I nodded, my interest growing. “And—the daughter?” I ventured. “A truly beautiful young girl—modest, devout, all that she should be. One pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and then—” The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically. “But it would not be her fault!” I cried, with rising indignation. “No. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife’s antecedents.” I was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. M. Hautet rang the bell. A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a footfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my young goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her cheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with apprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid! “Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we regret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law—you comprehend?

Her left hand was pressed to her side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice: “I will go and see. Please come inside.” She entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur of her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil. She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat. “I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can—er—throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl.

I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder—” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward.

Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?” “Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.” With mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards Merlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève. “The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking after them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down to the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only been here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted with M. Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the _dossier___ is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I—I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and—and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true.

Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is—any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know—but—any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. _Maman___ will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta.

Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “_Mon Dieu!___ But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when—” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you?

But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, _mon ami___, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself—but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. _Sacré!___ if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes—it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture—and in connection with some case.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,1,"We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ She will eat nothing—but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, _par exemple___, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest—of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel—quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack—_ma foi!___ they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris.

I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and his face was white—white—with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was angry!” Léonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly. “And the dispute, what was it about?” “Ah, that I do not know,” confessed Léonie. “It is true that they shouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so fast, that only one well acquainted with English could have comprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “_Quelle idée___,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the _salon___. It is cool there on this hot morning.” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind—” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least.

I turned up the path we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation. She not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an exclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella! The surprise was mutual. “You,” we both exclaimed simultaneously. The young lady recovered herself first. “My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” “For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted. “When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home to England like a good little boy.

My sister is well, I thank you.” “She is here with you?” “She remained in town,” said the minx with dignity. “I don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” I laughed. “If you have, her name is Harris!” “Do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile. “Cinderella. But you’re going to tell me the real one now, aren’t you?” She shook her head with a wicked look. “Not even why you’re here?” “Oh, that! I suppose you’ve heard of members of my profession ‘resting.’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime—at the Villa Geneviève—?” She stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean—that you’re in on _that?___” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily.

The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but—” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man. You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you _will___ show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “_Please___—there’s a dear.” I capitulated.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,7,"but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the _sergent de ville___ Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again. Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is.

The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and—unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her.

I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.…” I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. “Take me out of here—oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. “That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?” I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that—all alone.","['I', 'turn', 'corpse', 'gently', 'you', 'see', 'I', 'say', 'stab', 'back', 'her', 'voice', 'almost', 'soundless', 'with', 'I', 'nod', 'towards', 'glass', 'jar', 'that', 'dagger', 'suddenly', 'girl', 'reel', 'sink', 'heap', 'I', 'spring', 'assistance', 'you', 'faint', 'come', 'it', 'much', 'Water', 'murmur', 'quick', 'water', '…', 'I', 'leave', 'rush', 'house', 'fortunately', 'none', 'servant', 'I', 'able', 'secure', 'glass', 'water', 'unobserve', 'add', 'drop', 'brandy', 'pocket', 'flask', 'in', 'minute', 'I', 'back', 'the', 'girl', 'lie', 'I', 'leave', 'sip', 'brandy', 'water', 'revive', 'marvellous', 'manner', 'take', 'oh', 'quickly', 'quickly', 'cry', 'shudder', 'support', 'arm', 'I', 'lead', 'air', 'pull', 'door', 'behind', 'then', 'draw', 'deep', 'breath', 'that', '’', 'well', 'oh', 'horrible', 'why', 'ever', 'let', 'go', 'I', 'feel', 'feminine', 'I', 'could', 'forbear', 'smile', 'secretly', 'I', 'dissatisfied', 'collapse', 'it', 'prove', 'quite', 'callous', 'I', 'think', 'after', 'little', 'child', 'curiosity', 'probably', 'unthinking', 'order', 'I', 'good', 'stop', 'know', 'I', 'say', 'gently', 'I', 'suppose', 'well', 'good', 'bye', 'look', 'can', 'not', 'start', 'like', 'alone']"

I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.” She flashed a smile at me. “That’s so. Au revoir, then.” “Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?” “Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow.” “I will,” I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___.

Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key kept? _Parbleu___, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last.

Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… But no matter.” M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence. “_Eh bien___, M. Giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not?

The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me—nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match—not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he _did___ light his cigarette with.

Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice.

But several people _might___ have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener—he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.” “Who is that?” “Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly. “Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have heard about that, have you?” “I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably. “There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M.

And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember—but I shall do so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,9,"am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate—say a case of burglary—can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.” “And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both.

Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “_Eh bien___, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the _salon___ door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England.

Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well?

Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about. He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was—and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities.

But, for all that, there _was___ a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.” “So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M.

Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings.

Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled—and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew!

In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M.

We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur.

Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more—” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,1,"What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room. Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others. “Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the _Anzora___ from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man’s bow. “So you did not sail on the _Anzora?___” “No, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the _Anzora___ was detained twenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last night instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening paper, I saw in it an account of the—the awful tragedy that had befallen us—” His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. “My poor father—my poor, poor, father.” Staring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: “So you did not sail?” And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured as though to herself, “After all, it does not matter—now.” “Sit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing.

Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah. And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark _Anzora___ sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.” “You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret.

Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily. “You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We—we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other. “I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To which you responded: ‘I wish you were!’” The boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things—I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious—I could almost have killed him at that moment—there, make the most of that!” He leant back","['mission', 'South', 'America', 'connect', 'business', 'interest', 'as', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'pause', 'minute', 'quiet', 'voice', 'Giraud', 'break', 'I', 'like', 'put', 'question', 'account', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'by', 'mean', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'wish', 'say', 'magistrate', 'coldly', 'Giraud', 'edge', 'chair', 'little', 'near', 'table', 'be', 'good', 'term', 'father', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'certainly', 'I', 'return', 'lad', 'haughtily', 'you', 'assert', 'positively', 'yes', 'no', 'little', 'dispute', 'eh', 'Jack', 'shrug', 'shoulder', 'every', 'one', 'may', 'difference', 'opinion', 'quite', 'quite', 'but', 'one', 'assert', 'violent', 'quarrel', 'father', 'eve', 'departure', 'Paris', 'person', 'without', 'doubt', 'would', 'lie', 'I', 'could', 'admire', 'ingenuity', 'Giraud', 'his', 'boast', 'I', 'know', 'everything', 'idle', 'one', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'clearly', 'disconcert', 'question', 'we', 'argument', 'admit', 'ah', 'argument', 'in', 'course', 'argument', 'use', 'phrase', 'when', 'dead', 'I', 'I', 'please', 'I', 'may', 'do', 'mutter', 'I', 'n’t', 'know', 'in', 'response', 'father', 'say', 'but', 'I', 'dead', 'yet', 'to', 'respond', 'I', 'wish', 'the', 'boy', 'make', 'answer', 'his', 'hand', 'fiddle', 'nervously', 'thing', 'table', 'front', 'I', 'must', 'request', 'answer', 'please', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'say', 'Giraud', 'sharply', 'with', 'angry', 'exclamation', 'boy', 'sweep', 'heavy', 'paper', 'knife', 'floor', 'what', 'matter', 'you', 'might', 'well', 'know', 'yes', 'I', 'quarrel', 'father', 'I', 'dare', 'say', 'I', 'say', 'thing', 'I', 'angry', 'I', 'even', 'remember', 'I', 'say', 'I', 'furious', 'I', 'could', 'almost', 'kill', 'moment', 'make', 'he', 'leant', 'back']"

You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this—attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?” “I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should prefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents!” Her rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival. Mrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy","['chair', 'flushed', 'defiant', 'Giraud', 'smile', 'move', 'chair', 'back', 'little', 'say', 'that', 'you', 'would', 'without', 'doubt', 'prefer', 'continue', 'interrogatory', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'ah', 'yes', 'exactly', 'say', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'and', 'subject', 'quarrel', 'I', 'decline', 'state', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'sit', 'chair', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'permit', 'trifle', 'law', 'thunder', 'what', 'subject', 'quarrel', 'Young', 'Renauld', 'remain', 'silent', 'boyish', 'face', 'sullen', 'overcast', 'but', 'another', 'voice', 'speak', 'imperturbable', 'calm', 'voice', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'I', 'inform', 'like', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'you', 'know', 'certainly', 'I', 'know', 'the', 'subject', 'quarrel', 'Mademoiselle', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', 'renauld', 'spring', 'round', 'startle', 'the', 'magistrate', 'lean', 'forward', 'be', 'monsieur', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'bow', 'head', 'yes', 'admit', 'I', 'love', 'Mademoiselle', 'Daubreuil', 'I', 'wish', 'marry', 'when', 'I', 'inform', 'father', 'fact', 'fly', 'violent', 'rage', 'naturally', 'I', 'could', 'stand', 'hear', 'girl', 'I', 'love', 'insult', 'I', 'lose', 'temper', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'look', 'across', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'you', 'aware', 'attachment', 'madame', 'I', 'fear', 'reply', 'simply', 'Mother', 'cry', 'boy', 'you', 'Marthe', 'good', 'beautiful', 'what', 'I', 'nothing', 'Mademoiselle', 'Daubreuil', 'way', 'but', 'I', 'prefer', 'marry', 'Englishwoman', 'Frenchwoman', 'one', 'mother', 'doubtful', 'antecedent', 'her', 'rancour', 'old', 'woman', 'show', 'plainly', 'voice', 'I', 'could', 'well', 'understand', 'must', 'bitter', 'blow', 'son', 'show', 'sign', 'fall', 'love', 'daughter', 'rival', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'continue', 'address', 'magistrate', 'I', 'ought', 'perhaps', 'speak', 'husband', 'subject', 'I', 'hope', 'boy']"

I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me—especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death—” Poirot interrupted with a quick question. “You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my","['girl', 'flirtation', 'would', 'blow', 'quick', 'notice', 'take', 'I', 'blame', 'silence', 'husband', 'I', 'tell', 'seem', 'anxious', 'care', 'wear', 'different', 'altogether', 'normal', 'self', 'I', 'chiefly', 'concerned', 'give', 'additional', 'worry', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'nod', 'when', 'inform', 'father', 'intention', 'towards', 'Mademoiselle', 'Daubreuil', 'resume', 'surprised', 'he', 'seem', 'completely', 'take', 'aback', 'then', 'order', 'peremptorily', 'dismiss', 'idea', 'mind', 'he', 'would', 'never', 'give', 'consent', 'marriage', 'Nettled', 'I', 'demand', 'Mademoiselle', 'Daubreuil', 'to', 'could', 'give', 'satisfactory', 'reply', 'speak', 'slight', 'term', 'mystery', 'surround', 'life', 'mother', 'daughter', 'I', 'answer', 'I', 'marry', 'Marthe', 'antecedent', 'shout', 'peremptory', 'refusal', 'discuss', 'matter', 'way', 'the', 'whole', 'thing', 'must', 'give', 'the', 'injustice', 'high', 'handedness', 'madden', 'especially', 'since', 'always', 'seem', 'go', 'way', 'attentive', 'Daubreuils', 'always', 'suggest', 'ask', 'house', 'I', 'lose', 'head', 'quarrel', 'earnest', 'my', 'father', 'remind', 'I', 'entirely', 'dependent', 'must', 'answer', 'I', 'make', 'remark', 'I', 'please', 'death', 'Poirot', 'interrupt', 'quick', 'question', 'you', 'aware', 'term', 'father', '’s', 'I', 'know', 'leave', 'half', 'fortune', 'half', 'trust', 'mother', 'come', 'death', 'reply', 'lad', 'proceed', 'story', 'say', 'magistrate', 'after', 'shout', 'sheer', 'rage', 'I', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'I', 'danger', 'miss']"

I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective. Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so. “Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does—” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother.

Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis. “And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad—very distressing—” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean—that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was—was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the—the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still—M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.” The boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate, always disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied. “But no—not at present.

But the attention of the entire room was diverted to me. “What is that you say?” cried the commissary. “This morning?” “I saw it there this morning,” I said slowly. “About an hour and a half ago, to be accurate.” “You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?” “I asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.” “And you went there? Why?” I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. “M. le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “_Eh bien!___ Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I—well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, _par exemple___,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.” “I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident.","['risen', 'adjust', 'pair', 'candlestick', 'strike', 'train', 'eye', 'shade', 'askew', 'the', 'magistrate', 'read', 'mysterious', 'love', 'letter', 'last', 'time', 'cling', 'desperately', 'first', 'theory', 'jealousy', 'stab', 'back', 'suddenly', 'door', 'burst', 'open', 'commissary', 'rush', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'but', 'yes', 'what', 'the', 'dagger', 'it', 'go', 'comment___—gone', 'vanish', 'disappear', 'the', 'glass', 'jar', 'contain', 'empty', 'what', 'I', 'cry', 'impossible', 'why', 'morning', 'I', 'see', 'the', 'word', 'die', 'tongue', 'but', 'attention', 'entire', 'room', 'divert', 'what', 'say', 'cry', 'commissary', 'this', 'morning', 'I', 'see', 'morning', 'I', 'say', 'slowly', 'about', 'hour', 'half', 'ago', 'accurate', 'you', 'go', 'shed', 'how', 'get', 'key', 'I', 'ask', 'sergent', 'de', 'ville', 'and', 'go', 'why', 'I', 'hesitate', 'end', 'I', 'decide', 'thing', 'make', 'clean', 'breast', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'I', 'say', 'I', 'commit', 'grave', 'fault', 'I', 'must', 'crave', 'indulgence', 'eh', 'bien', 'proceed', 'monsieur', 'the', 'fact', 'matter', 'I', 'say', 'wish', 'anywhere', 'else', 'I', 'I', 'meet', 'young', 'lady', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'she', 'display', 'great', 'desire', 'see', 'everything', 'see', 'I', 'well', 'short', 'I', 'take', 'key', 'show', 'body', 'ah', 'par', 'exemple', 'cry', 'magistrate', 'indignantly', 'but', 'grave', 'fault', 'commit', 'Captain', 'Hastings', 'it', 'altogether', 'irregular', 'you', 'permit', 'folly', 'I', 'know', 'I', 'say', 'meekly', 'nothing', 'say', 'could', 'severe', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'you', 'invite', 'lady', 'come', 'certainly', 'I', 'meet', 'quite', 'accident']"

But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.” “That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least—” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “_Eh bien!___ I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong,","['she', 'english', 'lady', 'happen', 'stay', 'Merlinville', 'though', 'I', 'aware', 'unexpected', 'meeting', 'well', 'well', 'say', 'magistrate', 'soften', 'it', 'irregular', 'lady', 'without', 'doubt', 'young', 'beautiful', 'n’est', 'ce', 'pas', 'what', 'young', 'o', 'jeunesse', 'jeunesse', 'and', 'sigh', 'sentimentally', 'but', 'commissary', 'less', 'romantic', 'practical', 'take', 'tale', 'but', 'reclose', 'lock', 'door', 'depart', 'that', '’', 'I', 'say', 'slowly', 'that', '’', 'I', 'blame', 'terribly', 'my', 'friend', 'upset', 'sight', 'she', 'nearly', 'faint', 'I', 'get', 'brandy', 'water', 'afterwards', 'insist', 'accompany', 'back', 'town', 'in', 'excitement', 'I', 'forget', 'relock', 'door', 'I', 'I', 'get', 'back', 'Villa', 'then', 'twenty', 'minute', 'least', 'say', 'commissary', 'slowly', 'he', 'stop', 'exactly', 'I', 'say', 'twenty', 'minute', 'muse', 'commissary', 'it', 'deplorable', 'say', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'sternness', 'manner', 'return', 'without', 'precedent', 'suddenly', 'another', 'voice', 'speak', 'you', 'find', 'deplorable', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'ask', 'Giraud', 'certainly', 'I', 'eh', 'bien', 'I', 'find', 'admirable', 'say', 'imperturbably', 'this', 'unexpected', 'ally', 'quite', 'bewilder', 'Admirable', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'ask', 'magistrate', 'study', 'cautiously', 'corner', 'eye', 'precisely', 'and', 'because', 'know', 'assassin', 'accomplice', 'assassin', 'near', 'Villa', 'hour', 'ago', 'it', 'strange', 'knowledge', 'shortly', 'lay', 'hand', 'upon', 'there', 'note', 'menace', 'voice', 'he', 'continue', 'he', 'risk', 'good', 'deal', 'gain', 'possession', 'dagger', 'perhaps', 'fear', 'finger', 'print', 'might', 'discover', 'Poirot', 'turn', 'Bex', 'you', 'say', 'none', 'Giraud', 'shrug', 'shoulder', 'perhaps', 'could', 'sure', 'Poirot', 'look', 'you', 'wrong']"

It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “_Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!___” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: “Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air.","['M.', 'Giraud', 'the', 'assassin', 'wear', 'glove', 'so', 'must', 'sure', 'I', 'say', 'assassin', 'it', 'may', 'accomplice', 'aware', 'fact', 'Ils', 'sont', 'mal', 'renseignés', 'les', 'accomplice', 'mutter', 'Poirot', 'say', 'the', 'magistrate', '’s', 'clerk', 'gather', 'paper', 'table', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'address', 'we', 'our', 'work', 'finish', 'perhaps', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'listen', 'whilst', 'evidence', 'read', 'I', 'purposely', 'keep', 'proceeding', 'informal', 'possible', 'I', 'call', 'original', 'method', 'I', 'maintain', 'much', 'say', 'originality', 'the', 'case', 'clever', 'hand', 'renowned', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'he', 'without', 'doubt', 'distinguish', 'indeed', 'I', 'wonder', 'already', 'lay', 'hand', 'upon', 'murderer', 'Madame', 'let', 'assure', 'heart', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'Messieurs', 'I', 'wish', 'good', 'day', 'and', 'accompany', 'clerk', 'commissary', 'take', 'departure', 'Poirot', 'tug', 'large', 'turnip', 'watch', 'observe', 'time', 'let', 'we', 'return', 'hotel', 'lunch', 'friend', 'say', 'and', 'shall', 'recount', 'full', 'indiscretion', 'morning', 'no', 'one', 'observe', 'we', 'we', 'need', 'make', 'adieux', 'we', 'go', 'quietly', 'room', 'the', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'drive', 'car', 'I', 'go', 'step', 'Poirot', '’s', 'voice', 'arrest', 'one', 'little', 'moment', 'friend', 'dexterously', 'whip', 'yard', 'measure', 'proceed', 'quite', 'solemnly', 'measure', 'overcoat', 'hang', 'hall', 'collar', 'hem', 'I', 'see', 'hang', 'guess', 'belong', 'either', 'Mr.', 'Stonor', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'then', 'little', 'satisfied', 'grunt', 'Poirot', 'return', 'measure', 'pocket', 'follow', 'open', 'air']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,1,"“Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “_Parbleu!___ to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “_After all, it does not matter—now.___” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical—significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections.","['why', 'measure', 'overcoat', 'I', 'ask', 'curiosity', 'walk', 'hot', 'white', 'road', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'Parbleu', 'see', 'long', 'reply', 'friend', 'imperturbably', 'I', 'vex', 'Poirot', '’s', 'incurable', 'habit', 'make', 'mystery', 'nothing', 'never', 'fail', 'irritate', 'I', 'relapse', 'silence', 'follow', 'train', 'thought', 'although', 'I', 'notice', 'specially', 'time', 'certain', 'word', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'address', 'son', 'recur', 'fraught', 'new', 'significance', 'so', 'sail', 'say', 'add', 'after', 'matter', 'what', 'mean', 'the', 'word', 'enigmatical', 'significant', 'be', 'possible', 'know', 'suppose', 'she', 'deny', 'knowledge', 'mysterious', 'mission', 'husband', 'entrust', 'son', 'but', 'really', 'less', 'ignorant', 'pretend', 'could', 'enlighten', 'we', 'choose', 'silence', 'part', 'carefully', 'think', 'preconceive', 'plan', 'the', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'convince', 'I', 'right', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'know', 'choose', 'tell', 'in', 'surprise', 'see', 'son', 'momentarily', 'betray', 'I', 'feel', 'convinced', 'know', 'assassin', 'least', 'motive', 'assassination', 'but', 'powerful', 'consideration', 'must', 'keep', 'silent', 'you', 'think', 'profoundly', 'friend', 'remark', 'Poirot', 'break', 'upon', 'reflection']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,2,"“What is it that intrigues you so?” I told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully. “You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not of inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.” “You suspected _her?___” I cried. “But certainly! She benefits enormously—in fact, by this new will, she is the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out for attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. _Eh bien___, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me—the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’—I had heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!___” Again that wrist watch!

You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, _c’est entendu?___ He treats me as an old one of no importance! _We shall see!___ In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “_C’est bien!___ Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. _The crime took place at least two hours earlier.___” “But the doctors—” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. _Mon ami___, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did.

So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points—first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course.

He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? _Eh bien___, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a _cause célèbre___ unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details.

It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life—there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced.

Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to find! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good retriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has crawled on his stomach. ‘See what I have found,’ he says.

But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime.

No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception—the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men—she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “_A la bonne heure!___ Let us hear it.” “Listen.

Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment—possibly with the murderer—leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat—but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of—they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No—_and there ought to have been.___ Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots—in the other, _none!___ You see?

Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, _mon ami___.” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in—do not reject it but consider it closely. Though its significance escapes you, be sure that it is significant.” “In the meantime,” I said, considering, “although we know a great deal more than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed Mr. Renauld.” “No,” said Poirot cheerfully. “In fact we are a great deal further off.” The fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed at him in wonder.

She must be shielding somebody.” From the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see that the idea had already occurred to him. “Yes,” he said thoughtfully. “Shielding some one—or screening some one. One of the two.” I saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my theme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly non-committal attitude, repeating: “It may be—yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something very deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture.","['event', 'clear', 'theory', 'whose', 'hand', 'meet', 'death', 'now', 'go', 'we', 'darkness', 'a', 'hundred', 'conflict', 'point', 'confuse', 'worry', 'we', 'that', 'well', 'that', 'excellent', 'out', 'confusion', 'come', 'forth', 'order', 'but', 'find', 'order', 'start', 'crime', 'seem', 'simple', 'board', 'eh', 'bien', 'méfiez', 'vous', 'it', 'say', 'it?—_cooke', 'the', 'great', 'criminal', 'simple', 'criminal', 'great', 'in', 'try', 'cover', 'track', 'invariably', 'betray', 'ah', 'mon', 'ami', 'I', 'would', 'day', 'I', 'could', 'meet', 'really', 'great', 'criminal', 'one', 'commit', 'crime', 'nothing', 'even', 'I', 'Hercule', 'Poirot', 'might', 'fail', 'catch', 'one', 'but', 'I', 'follow', 'word', 'a', 'light', 'burst', 'upon', 'Poirot', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'I', 'see', 'she', 'must', 'shield', 'somebody', 'from', 'quietness', 'Poirot', 'receive', 'remark', 'I', 'could', 'see', 'idea', 'already', 'occur', 'yes', 'say', 'thoughtfully', 'shield', 'one', 'screen', 'one', 'one', 'two', 'I', 'see', 'little', 'difference', 'two', 'word', 'I', 'develop', 'theme', 'good', 'deal', 'earnestness', 'Poirot', 'maintain', 'strictly', 'non', 'committal', 'attitude', 'repeat', 'it', 'may', 'yes', 'may', 'but', 'yet', 'I', 'know', 'there', 'something', 'deep', 'underneath', 'you', 'see', 'something', 'deep', 'then', 'enter', 'hotel', 'enjoin', 'silence', 'gesture']"

I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: “_Eh bien!___ And your indiscretions! You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance. But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. “_Tiens!___ A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?” I had to confess that I did not know. “Still more romantic! The first _rencontre___ in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the saying?” “Don’t be an ass, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle—Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!” “It’s all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely—I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing—don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well—it sounds snobbish perhaps—but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully.

It never answers.” “I agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.” His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with _empressement___: “I will.” Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold blood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her intensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again. I answered Poirot lightly enough. “She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan’t.” “Why ‘of course’?” “Well—I don’t want to.” “I see.” He studied me attentively for some minutes. “Yes.

They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, _mon ami___.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I must look for him.

I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel du Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge.

I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till my impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and slipped five francs into his hand. “I wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small and dark. I am not sure of her name.” The man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin. “There is no such lady as you describe staying here.” “She is American possibly,” I suggested. These fellows are so stupid. But the man continued to shake his head. “No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake—or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.” “What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it!

Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one’s friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel. Then another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand. In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they","['meddle', 'concern', 'do', 'fancy', 'I', 'need', 'nurse', 'look', 'thank', 'man', 'I', 'depart', 'somewhat', 'loss', 'still', 'much', 'incense', 'meddlesome', 'friend', 'I', 'regret', 'moment', 'reach', 'I', 'enjoy', 'tell', 'I', 'think', 'unwarranted', 'interference', 'have', 'I', 'distinctly', 'tell', 'I', 'intention', 'see', 'girl', 'decidedly', 'one', '’s', 'friend', 'zealous', 'but', 'lady', 'I', 'set', 'aside', 'wrath', 'try', 'puzzle', 'evidently', 'inadvertence', 'name', 'wrong', 'hotel', 'then', 'another', 'thought', 'strike', 'be', 'inadvertence', 'or', 'deliberately', 'withhold', 'name', 'give', 'wrong', 'address', 'the', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'feel', 'convinced', 'last', 'surmise', 'mine', 'right', 'for', 'reason', 'wish', 'let', 'acquaintance', 'ripen', 'friendship', 'and', 'though', 'half', 'hour', 'early', 'precisely', 'view', 'I', 'enjoy', 'table', 'turn', 'upon', 'the', 'whole', 'affair', 'profoundly', 'unsatisfactory', 'I', 'go', 'Villa', 'Geneviève', 'condition', 'distinct', 'ill', 'humour', 'I', 'go', 'house', 'go', 'path', 'little', 'bench', 'shed', 'sit', 'moodily', 'enough', 'I', 'distract', 'thought', 'sound', 'voice', 'close', 'hand', 'in', 'second', 'two', 'I', 'realize', 'come', 'garden', 'I', 'adjoining', 'garden', 'Villa', 'Marguerite']"

A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. “_Chéri___,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack—I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear—now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid—for _you___.…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdrew itself","['approach', 'rapidly', 'a', 'girl', '’s', 'voice', 'speak', 'voice', 'I', 'recognize', 'beautiful', 'Marthe', 'Chéri', 'say', 'really', 'true', 'be', 'trouble', 'you', 'know', 'Marthe', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'reply', 'nothing', 'part', 'we', 'belove', 'the', 'last', 'obstacle', 'union', 'remove', 'nothing', 'take', 'nothing', 'girl', 'murmur', 'oh', 'Jack', 'Jack', 'I', 'afraid', 'I', 'move', 'depart', 'realize', 'I', 'quite', 'unintentionally', 'eavesdropping', 'as', 'I', 'rise', 'foot', 'I', 'catch', 'sight', 'gap', 'hedge', 'they', 'stand', 'together', 'face', 'man', '’s', 'arm', 'round', 'girl', 'eye', 'look', 'they', 'splendid', 'looking', 'couple', 'dark', 'well', 'knit', 'boy', 'fair', 'young', 'goddess', 'they', 'seem', 'make', 'stand', 'happy', 'spite', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'overshadow', 'young', 'life', 'but', 'girl', '’s', 'face', 'troubled', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'seem', 'recognize', 'hold', 'close', 'ask', 'but', 'afraid', 'darling', 'what', 'fear', 'and', 'I', 'see', 'look', 'eye', 'look', 'Poirot', 'speak', 'murmur', 'I', 'almost', 'guess', 'word', 'I', 'afraid', '…', 'I', 'hear', 'young', 'Renauld', '’s', 'answer', 'attention', 'distract', 'unusual', 'appearance', 'little', 'hedge', 'there', 'appear', 'brown', 'bush', 'seem', 'odd', 'say', 'least', 'early', 'summer', 'I', 'step', 'along', 'investigate', 'advance', 'brown', 'bush', 'withdraw']"

Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing—listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud. “I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly. “And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.” “Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. “They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better. But what does he think he will find there?” I thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself up. “That I am not at liberty to say,” I said quietly. Giraud subjected me to a piercing stare. “He has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,” he remarked rudely. “Good afternoon. I’m busy.” And with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony. Matters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Geneviève.

I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. “Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the affair at the Villa Geneviève?’ “Yes,” I said eagerly. “Why?” “Monsieur has not heard the news, though?” “What news?” “That there has been another murder there last night!” “_What?___” Leaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could. Another murder—and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. “What has happened?” “Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself. “Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know—me? A man—a stranger.

The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, _c’est l’Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across.

His face was terribly convulsed, and on his left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up, black and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! “I’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained Giraud. “Although we hardly need him. There’s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.” “When was it done? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel!

The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done.

He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell. He merely called to Marchaud: “You have got the other there?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil.

For all I know you may have committed them both.” “How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild accusation! It is infamous.” “Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the hair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards her. “You permit that I see whether it matches?” With a cry she started backwards, white to the lips. “It is false—I swear it. I know nothing of the crime—of either crime. Any one who says I do lies! Ah! _mon Dieu___, what shall I do?” “Calm yourself, madame,” said Giraud coldly. “No one has accused you as yet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.” “Anything you wish, monsieur.” “Look at the dead man. Have you ever seen him before?” Drawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity.

Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked in a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her head.” “I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.” Then, frowning, he gazed down at the body. “Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly. I considered the face carefully. “No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.” Giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. “Same here.” He stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. He pounced on a bundle by the door,","['shake', 'head', 'I', 'know', 'it', 'seem', 'impossible', 'doubt', 'word', 'come', 'naturally', 'Giraud', 'dismiss', 'nod', 'head', 'you', 'let', 'go', 'I', 'ask', 'low', 'voice', 'be', 'wise', 'surely', 'black', 'hair', 'head', 'I', 'need', 'teach', 'business', 'say', 'Giraud', 'dryly', 'she', 'surveillance', 'I', 'wish', 'arrest', 'yet', 'then', 'frown', 'gaze', 'body', 'should', 'say', 'spanish', 'type', 'ask', 'suddenly', 'I', 'consider', 'face', 'carefully', 'no', 'I', 'say', 'last', 'I', 'put', 'Frenchman', 'decidedly', 'Giraud', 'give', 'grunt', 'dissatisfaction', 'same', 'he', 'stand', 'moment', 'imperative', 'gesture', 'wave', 'aside', 'hand', 'knee', 'continue', 'search', 'floor', 'shed', 'he', 'marvellous', 'nothing', 'escape', 'inch', 'inch', 'go', 'floor', 'turn', 'pot', 'examine', 'old', 'sack', 'he', 'pounce', 'bundle', 'door']"

Two pairs of old gloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them aside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over one by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head thoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten my presence. But, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old friend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex, with the doctor behind him, came bustling in. “But this is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,” cried M. Hautet. “Another crime! Ah, we have not got to the bottom of this case. There is some deep mystery here. But who is the victim this time?” “That is just what nobody can tell us, M. le juge. He has not been identified.” “Where is the body?” asked the doctor.

I fancy that the murder followed hard upon the theft—but that is for you to say. You can handle the dagger freely—there are no finger-prints on it.” The doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate. “A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.” “And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it possibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among themselves.” Giraud shook his head. “The man is a Frenchman—I would take my oath of that—” But at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression. “You say he was killed yesterday morning?” “I fix it by the theft of the dagger,” explained Giraud. “He may, of course, have been killed later in the day.” “Later in the day? Fiddlesticks! This man has been dead at least forty-eight hours, and probably longer.” We stared at each other in blank amazement.","['heart', 'see', 'and', 'dagger', 'steal', 'yesterday', 'morning', 'I', 'fancy', 'murder', 'follow', 'hard', 'upon', 'theft', 'say', 'you', 'handle', 'dagger', 'freely', 'finger', 'print', 'the', 'doctor', 'kneel', 'dead', 'man', 'Giraud', 'turn', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'a', 'pretty', 'little', 'problem', 'but', 'I', 'shall', 'solve', 'and', 'one', 'identify', 'muse', 'magistrate', 'could', 'possibly', 'one', 'assassin', 'they', 'may', 'fall', 'among', 'Giraud', 'shake', 'head', 'the', 'man', 'Frenchman', 'I', 'would', 'take', 'oath', 'but', 'moment', 'interrupt', 'doctor', 'sit', 'back', 'heel', 'perplexed', 'expression', 'you', 'say', 'kill', 'yesterday', 'morning', 'I', 'fix', 'theft', 'dagger', 'explain', 'Giraud', 'he', 'may', 'course', 'kill', 'later', 'day', 'later', 'day', 'fiddlestick', 'this', 'man', 'dead', 'least', 'forty', 'eight', 'hour', 'probably', 'long', 'we', 'stare', 'blank', 'amazement']"

Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have been stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand asserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours! The whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme. We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s announcement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28. I looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case. Evidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in Paris. The quickness of his return proved that. Very few hours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I had to impart. The train was some minutes late, and I strolled aimlessly up and down the platform, until it occurred to me that I might","['the', 'doctor', '’s', 'word', 'surprising', 'momentarily', 'take', 'aback', 'here', 'man', 'stab', 'dagger', 'know', 'steal', 'twenty', 'four', 'hour', 'previously', 'yet', 'Dr.', 'Durand', 'assert', 'positively', 'dead', 'least', 'forty', 'eight', 'hour', 'the', 'whole', 'thing', 'fantastic', 'last', 'extreme', 'we', 'still', 'recover', 'surprise', 'doctor', '’s', 'announcement', 'telegram', 'bring', 'it', 'send', 'hotel', 'Villa', 'I', 'tear', 'open', 'it', 'Poirot', 'announce', 'return', 'train', 'arrive', 'Merlinville', '12:28', 'I', 'look', 'watch', 'see', 'I', 'time', 'get', 'comfortably', 'station', 'meet', 'I', 'feel', 'utmost', 'importance', 'know', 'new', 'startling', 'development', 'case', 'evidently', 'I', 'reflect', 'Poirot', 'difficulty', 'find', 'want', 'Paris', 'the', 'quickness', 'return', 'prove', 'very', 'hour', 'suffice', 'I', 'wonder', 'would', 'take', 'exciting', 'news', 'I', 'impart', 'the', 'train', 'minute', 'late', 'I', 'stroll', 'aimlessly', 'platform', 'occur', 'I', 'might']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,2,"pass the time by asking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train on the evening of the tragedy. I approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had little difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject. It was a disgrace to the Police, he hotly affirmed, that such brigands of assassins should be allowed to go about unpunished. I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners—he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head—possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones—but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld—he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me. Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,3,"the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform. “_Mon cher ami___, I have succeeded—but succeeded to a marvel!” “Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it. Have you heard the latest here?” “How would you that I should hear anything? There have been some developments, eh? The brave Giraud, he has made an arrest? Or even arrests perhaps?

Also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat. And my tie, that I must rearrange.” I cut short his remonstrances. “My dear Poirot—never mind all that. We must go to the Villa at once. _There has been another murder!___” I have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving news of importance to my friend. Either he has known it already or he has dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue—and in the latter case events have usually proved him justified. But this time I could not complain of missing my effect. Never have I seen a man so flabbergasted. His jaw dropped. All the jauntiness went out of his bearing. He stared at me open-mouthed. “What is that you say? Another murder? Ah, then, I am all wrong. I have failed. Giraud may mock himself at me—he will have reason!” “You did not expect it, then?” “I? Not the least in the world. It demolishes my theory—it ruins everything—it—ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest. “It is impossible. I _cannot___ be wrong!

I must be right, therefore this new murder is impossible unless—unless—oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word—” He was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he said in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age. His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily in the back.” It was my turn to gape—and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a doubt crossed my mind. “Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it already.” He turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully. “Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever. Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?” “But how on earth could you know all that?” “I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the little grey cells!

If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected.

Equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___ mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care, also the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at Giraud. “You saw these?” “Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable. Suddenly Poirot stiffened. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor came forward. “There is foam on the","['thing', 'mention', 'there', 'reason', 'mention', 'many', 'thing', 'may', 'important', 'equally', 'often', 'excellent', 'reason', 'mention', 'you', 'take', 'choice', 'two', 'motive', 'I', 'silent', 'impress', 'spite', 'another', 'minute', 'bring', 'we', 'famous', 'shed', 'we', 'find', 'friend', 'interchange', 'polite', 'amenity', 'Poirot', 'begin', 'task', 'having', 'watch', 'Giraud', 'work', 'I', 'keenly', 'interested', 'Poirot', 'bestow', 'cursory', 'glance', 'surrounding', 'the', 'thing', 'examine', 'ragged', 'coat', 'trouser', 'door', 'a', 'disdainful', 'smile', 'rise', 'Giraud', '’s', 'lip', 'though', 'note', 'Poirot', 'fling', 'bundle', 'old', 'clothe', 'gardener', '’s', 'query', 'exactly', 'say', 'Giraud', 'Poirot', 'kneel', 'body', 'his', 'finger', 'rapid', 'methodical', 'he', 'examine', 'texture', 'clothe', 'satisfy', 'mark', 'the', 'boot', 'subject', 'special', 'care', 'also', 'dirty', 'broken', 'finger', 'nail', 'whilst', 'examine', 'latter', 'throw', 'quick', 'question', 'Giraud', 'you', 'see', 'yes', 'I', 'see', 'reply', 'his', 'face', 'remain', 'inscrutable', 'suddenly', 'Poirot', 'stiffen', 'Dr.', 'Durand', 'yes', 'the', 'doctor', 'come', 'forward', 'there', 'foam']"

You observed it?” “I didn’t notice it, I must admit.” “But you observe it now?” “Oh, certainly.” Poirot again shot a question at Giraud. “You noticed it without doubt?” The other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed _after he was dead___.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M. Giraud agrees with me, do you not, monsieur?” Whatever Giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving a muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied: “Certainly I agree.” The murmur of surprise and interest broke out again. “But what an idea!” cried M.

Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.” “No, M. le juge,” said Poirot. “I should fancy it was done quite cold-bloodedly—to create an impression.” “What impression?” “The impression it nearly did create,” returned Poirot oracularly. M. Bex had been thinking. “How, then, was the man killed?” “He was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much mistaken, of an epileptic fit!” This statement of Poirot’s again aroused considerable excitement. Dr. Durand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he rose to his feet. “Well, M. le docteur?” “M. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your assertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that the man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other indications.” Poirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse in compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave the shed, Giraud approached us. “One more thing, M. Poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “We found this coiled round the handle of the dagger.","['man', 'dead', 'Barbaric', 'unheard', 'some', 'unappeasable', 'hate', 'perhaps', 'no', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'say', 'Poirot', 'I', 'fancy', 'do', 'quite', 'cold', 'bloodedly', 'create', 'impression', 'what', 'impression', 'the', 'impression', 'nearly', 'create', 'return', 'Poirot', 'oracularly', 'M.', 'Bex', 'think', 'how', 'man', 'kill', 'he', 'kill', 'he', 'die', 'he', 'die', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'I', 'much', 'mistaken', 'epileptic', 'fit', 'this', 'statement', 'Poirot', '’s', 'arouse', 'considerable', 'excitement', 'Dr.', 'Durand', 'kneel', 'make', 'search', 'examination', 'at', 'last', 'rise', 'foot', 'well', 'M.', 'le', 'docteur', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'I', 'inclined', 'believe', 'correct', 'assertion', 'I', 'mislead', 'begin', 'the', 'incontrovertible', 'fact', 'man', 'stab', 'distract', 'attention', 'indication', 'Poirot', 'hero', 'hour', 'the', 'examine', 'magistrate', 'profuse', 'compliment', 'Poirot', 'respond', 'gracefully', 'excuse', 'pretext', 'neither', 'I', 'yet', 'lunch', 'wish', 'repair', 'ravage', 'journey', 'as', 'leave', 'shed', 'Giraud', 'approach', 'we', 'one', 'thing', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'say', 'suave', 'mocking', 'voice', 'we', 'find', 'coil', 'round', 'handle', 'dagger']"

Then, with a bow, he left us. “He was insistent, the good Giraud,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked towards the hotel. “I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair—h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend.

Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a stout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his charming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although doing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with. But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance. Young and good looking, and gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, Madame Beroldy at once created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be whispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth.

Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke, and that the union was legal, though morganatic. But all stories agreed upon one point, that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery. Questioned by the curious, Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours. On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her “lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To intimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political intrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with herself acting as the go-between. Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart.

When the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another personage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of the United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful. About this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried on her husband’s behalf. She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but Madame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris.

Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.” But the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their request.

The affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously as “the Nihilist Atrocity,” “Revolutionaries in Paris,” and the “Russian Mystery.” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a _cause célèbre___. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination.

Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife.

Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age. Absurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great number of people believed implicitly in their truth. But the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked “Russians” as a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame Beroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed that the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she could easily have freed herself.

The crime had been planned between them. Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free—but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation.

Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented—also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime. But she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husband’s murderer, and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with the planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night to find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in his hand.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,1,"I have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here. Nevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance. The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of view struck me at once. “Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you.

Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil—Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld. The similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.” “Then you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted? That in actual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband’s murder?” I opened my eyes wide. “But of course! Don’t you?” Poirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a chair, and then said thoughtfully. “Yes, that is my opinion. But there is no ‘of course’ about it, my friend. Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.” “Of that crime, perhaps. But not of this.” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why?” He shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback. “Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because—” I came to a stop.

We can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You cannot have a murder without a motive. The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the _crime passionnel___ is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the _crime passionnel?___ Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head. “If—I say _if___, you note—Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire","['stumble', 'block', 'why', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'I', 'shall', 'call', 'clearness', 'sake', 'murder', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'we', 'find', 'shadow', 'motive', 'she', 'benefit', 'death', 'consider', 'either', 'mistress', 'blackmailer', 'stand', 'lose', 'you', 'murder', 'without', 'motive', 'the', 'first', 'crime', 'different', 'rich', 'lover', 'wait', 'step', 'husband', '’s', 'shoe', 'money', 'motive', 'murder', 'I', 'object', 'true', 'agree', 'Poirot', 'placidly', 'there', 'two', 'other', 'crime', 'passionnel', 'one', 'and', 'third', 'rare', 'motive', 'murder', 'idea', 'imply', 'form', 'mental', 'derangement', 'part', 'murderer', 'homicidal', 'mania', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'belong', 'class', 'we', 'rule', 'but', 'crime', 'passionnel', 'can', 'rule', 'if', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'Renauld', '’s', 'mistress', 'find', 'affection', 'cool', 'jealousy', 'arouse', 'way', 'might', 'strike', 'moment', 'anger', 'Poirot', 'shake', 'head', 'if', 'I', 'say', 'note', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'Renauld', '’s', 'mistress', 'time', 'tire']"

She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that!

It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale—if it were all would indeed be plain sailing—it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “_Mon ami___, you must make your own deductions.

The first I have solved, the second—_eh bien___, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime.

The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think—” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants—there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man—Jack Renauld. _And a man must have dug a grave.…___ I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room.

Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you not to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.” “Very well, I will go straight to the station.” He rose to his feet.

Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack Renauld’s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself. “You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining magistrate this morning.” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there—for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return.

Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I—I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, _mon ami___, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings!

Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon.

He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle!

You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast. “Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected—but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M.

Poirot, too, watched her intently. “You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face.

M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking—” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M.

The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M.

I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “_Maman___,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is","['I', 'almost', 'sure', 'tramp', 'dead', 'man', 'shed', 'one', 'Poirot', 'utter', 'exclamation', 'but', 'say', 'time', 'mademoiselle', 'because', 'first', 'strike', 'face', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'way', 'the', 'man', 'differently', 'dress', 'apparently', 'belong', 'superior', 'station', 'life', 'but', 'tell', 'Monsieur', 'Poirot', 'possible', 'tramp', 'might', 'attack', 'kill', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'take', 'clothe', 'money', 'it', 'idea', 'mademoiselle', 'say', 'Poirot', 'slowly', 'it', 'leave', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'certainly', 'idea', 'I', 'think', 'a', 'voice', 'call', 'house', 'maman', 'whisper', 'Marthe', 'I', 'must', 'go', 'and', 'slip', 'away', 'tree', 'come', 'say', 'Poirot', 'take', 'arm', 'turn', 'direction', 'Villa', 'what', 'really', 'think', 'I', 'ask', 'curiosity', 'be', 'story', 'true', 'girl', 'make', 'order', 'divert', 'suspicion', 'lover', 'it']"

It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted.

Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice—an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman—and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically.

He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking—in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up.

Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack. “He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M.

He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice.

There is just a chance of it. Of course Giraud is all wrong—wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not _because___ of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case.

From farther along the sand, the cries of the bathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my own good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only three days! “Think, my friend,” said Poirot’s voice encouragingly. “Arrange your ideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case.

Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis. “You have a little idea, I see, _mon ami!___ Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we—although I dare say _I___ would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.” “And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes. “Georges Conneau!”","['Giraud', 'Poirot', 'despise', 'I', 'reflect', 'anew', 'if', 'daylight', 'anywhere', 'direction', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'Giraud', 'ignorant', 'connection', 'Beroldy', 'Case', 'Poirot', 'declare', 'Beroldy', 'Case', 'important', 'it', 'I', 'must', 'seek', 'I', 'right', 'track', 'and', 'suddenly', 'I', 'start', 'idea', 'bewilder', 'luminosity', 'shoot', 'brain', 'tremble', 'I', 'build', 'hypothesis', 'you', 'little', 'idea', 'I', 'see', 'mon', 'ami', 'capital', 'we', 'progress', 'I', 'sit', 'light', 'pipe', 'Poirot', 'I', 'say', 'seem', 'strangely', 'remiss', 'I', 'say', 'although', 'I', 'dare', 'say', 'i', 'would', 'near', 'mark', 'but', 'must', 'pay', 'penalty', 'determined', 'secrecy', 'so', 'I', 'say', 'strangely', 'remiss', 'there', 'one', 'forget', 'and', 'inquire', 'Poirot', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'Georges', 'Conneau']"

You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.” I was so flattered by the little man’s approval that I could hardly continue. But at last I collected my thoughts and went on. “Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to believe that he is dead.” “_Aucunement___,” agreed Poirot. “Proceed.” “Therefore we will assume that he is alive.” “Exactly.” “Or that he was alive until recently.” “_De mieux en mieux!___” “We will presume,” I continued, my enthusiasm rising, “that he has fallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp—a what you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.” “Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot. “Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it likely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and Conneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there suddenly falls down in an epileptic fit.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,2,"this scandal of the past is revived. His father’s murderer is dead—let them do their best to hush it up. Jack Renauld consents—goes to the house and has an interview with his mother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned back, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction. Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “I think that you should write for the Kinema, _mon ami___,” he remarked at last. “You mean—?” “It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there—but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.” “I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but—” “You have gone further—you have ignored them magnificently. What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats—eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.” I was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this. “_Your___ theory,” I remarked acidly,","['scandal', 'past', 'revive', 'his', 'father', '’s', 'murderer', 'dead', 'let', 'good', 'hush', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'consent', 'go', 'house', 'interview', 'mother', 'win', 'point', 'view', 'prime', 'story', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'suggest', 'permit', 'gag', 'bind', 'there', 'Poirot', 'think', 'I', 'lean', 'back', 'flush', 'pride', 'successful', 'reconstruction', 'Poirot', 'look', 'thoughtfully', 'I', 'think', 'write', 'Kinema', 'mon', 'ami', 'remark', 'last', 'you', 'mean', 'it', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'story', 'recount', 'bear', 'sort', 'resemblance', 'everyday', 'life', 'I', 'admit', 'I', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'you', 'go', 'ignore', 'magnificently', 'what', 'way', 'two', 'man', 'dress', 'do', 'suggest', 'stab', 'victim', 'Conneau', 'remove', 'suit', 'clothe', 'don', 'replace', 'dagger', 'I', 'not', 'see', 'matter', 'I', 'object', 'rather', 'huffily', 'he', 'may', 'obtain', 'clothe', 'money', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'threat', 'early', 'day', 'by', 'threat', 'eh', 'you', 'seriously', 'advance', 'supposition', 'certainly', 'he', 'could', 'threaten', 'reveal', 'identity', 'Renaulds', 'would', 'probably', 'put', 'end', 'hope', 'daughter', '’s', 'marriage', 'you', 'wrong', 'Hastings', 'he', 'could', 'blackmail', 'whip', 'hand', 'Georges', 'Conneau', 'remember', 'still', 'want', 'murder', 'a', 'word', 'danger', 'guillotine', 'I', 'force', 'rather', 'reluctantly', 'admit', 'truth', 'your', 'theory', 'I', 'remark', 'acidly']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,3,"“is doubtless correct as to all the details?” “My theory is the truth,” said Poirot quietly. “And the truth is necessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order.

The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “_23rd May.___ M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “_24th May.___ M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “_7th June.___ Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M.

After a moment or two, I said rather doubtfully: “As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, decidedly.

But did he?” “The letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.” “No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written to M. Renauld?” “Why it was found in his pocket and—and—” “And that is all!” cut in Poirot. “There was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, _mon ami___, something about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should have given you to think.” “I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,” I confessed. “Ah, _quelle idée!___ Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M.

I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, _mon ami___—at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M. Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.” “Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched.

If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and—what is more—send his son there?” “It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.” Poirot shook his head. “My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up.

Not only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.” “Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered. “That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch—which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.” I stared at him, stupefied. “But how? Why? How can you possibly know?” “Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. _Mon ami___, I have taken you step by step along the way.

I will impart it to you—” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating—for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, _ne vous impatientez pas!___ I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action—three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, _mon ami___, let me ask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?” “Georges Conneau,” I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily. “Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child.

So we are forced to the second—that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved—or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “_Bien!___ Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but—” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld _did___ love.” I shook my head perplexed. “_Mais, oui___, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?” I stared dumbfounded. “Her husband?” I gasped. Poirot nodded. “Her husband—or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.” I rallied myself. “But it’s impossible.” “How ‘impossible?’ Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was in a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?” “Yes, but—” “And did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?” “That may be true enough, but—” “And is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime.

So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you—he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M.

There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago.

It is, of course, a gold mine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds him heavily. “And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That rouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father’s past, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape—death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will.

On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter—_now___.’ And no one noticed—no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted!

For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress—for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life. ‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the _soupçon___ of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And that imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends!

If he has arrived at the right person by the wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.” “But surely—” I paused as I saw the new trend of things. “You see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death—the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There _were___ two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological—heredity, _mon ami___, heredity! Like father, like son—Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?”","['shortcoming', 'as', 'I', 'say', 'if', 'arrive', 'right', 'person', 'wrong', 'method', 'permit', 'worry', 'but', 'surely', 'I', 'pause', 'I', 'see', 'new', 'trend', 'thing', 'you', 'see', 'Hastings', 'must', 'start', 'who', 'kill', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'some', 'one', 'near', 'Villa', 'twelve', 'o’clock', 'night', 'one', 'would', 'benefit', 'death', 'description', 'fit', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'well', 'the', 'crime', 'need', 'premeditate', 'and', 'dagger', 'I', 'start', 'I', 'realize', 'point', 'of', 'course', 'I', 'say', 'the', 'second', 'dagger', 'find', 'tramp', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', '’s', 'there', 'two', 'certainly', 'since', 'duplicate', 'stand', 'reason', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'owner', 'but', 'would', 'trouble', 'much', 'in', 'fact', 'I', 'little', 'idea', 'no', 'bad', 'indictment', 'psychological', 'heredity', 'mon', 'ami', 'heredity', 'like', 'father', 'like', 'son', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'say', 'do', 'son', 'Georges', 'Conneau', 'his', 'tone', 'grave', 'earnest', 'I', 'impressed', 'spite', 'what', 'little', 'idea', 'mention', 'I', 'ask', 'for', 'answer', 'Poirot', 'consult', 'turnip', 'face', 'watch', 'ask', 'what', 'time', 'afternoon', 'boat', 'Calais']"

We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why?” “To find a possible—witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her—what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her—but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name _is___ Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right—especially with the help of _this___.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate—but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella.","['about', 'five', 'I', 'believe', 'that', 'well', 'we', 'shall', 'time', 'you', 'go', 'England', 'yes', 'friend', 'why', 'to', 'find', 'possible', 'witness', 'who', 'with', 'rather', 'peculiar', 'smile', 'upon', 'face', 'Poirot', 'reply', 'Miss', 'Bella', 'Duveen', 'but', 'find', 'know', 'I', 'know', 'nothing', 'I', 'guess', 'good', 'deal', 'we', 'may', 'take', 'grant', 'name', 'Bella', 'Duveen', 'since', 'name', 'faintly', 'familiar', 'M.', 'Stonor', 'though', 'evidently', 'connection', 'Renauld', 'family', 'probable', 'stage', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'young', 'man', 'plenty', 'money', 'twenty', 'year', 'age', 'the', 'stage', 'sure', 'home', 'first', 'love', 'it', 'tally', 'M.', 'Renauld', '’s', 'attempt', 'placate', 'cheque', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'shall', 'find', 'right', 'especially', 'help', 'and', 'bring', 'photograph', 'I', 'see', 'take', 'Jack', 'Renauld', '’s', 'drawer', 'with', 'love', 'Bella', 'scrawl', 'across', 'corner', 'hold', 'eye', 'fascinated', 'the', 'likeness', 'first', 'rate', 'unmistakable', 'I', 'feel', 'cold', 'sinking', 'though', 'unutterable', 'calamity', 'befall', 'it', 'face', 'Cinderella']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,1,"For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch. All is well—the sea it will be calm!” In the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on board the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself together, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect—but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat.

What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much. What kept her there—the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the _Anzora___ had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory.

It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, _mon ami___. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “_Eh bien___, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can’t place it. What’s her line?” “That I do not know—but here is her photograph.” Mr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted. “Got it!” He slapped his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “That’s it.

You go home, and I’ll send you round the dope in the morning.” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words—or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously, would-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely slicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout prima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian endeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally. At last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My heart beat sickeningly. There she was—there they both were, the pair of them, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short fluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause.

I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here—in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the—the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything—understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for—me?” she half whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry.

And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been—rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to—to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love—and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t—you can’t—not if you knew—” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night.

Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly—but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links—” Again I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you—but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused. “You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad—and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost","['leave', 'house', 'I', 'pause', 'go', 'next', 'I', 'not', 'know', 'whether', 'know', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'would', 'come', 'night', 'whether', 'wait', 'chance', 'see', 'wait', 'perhaps', 'miserable', 'walk', 'aimlessly', 'rate', 'twelve', 'still', 'near', 'see', 'man', 'golf', 'link', 'again', 'I', 'pause', 'I', 'leap', 'truth', 'flash', 'enter', 'room', 'picture', 'rise', 'even', 'convincingly', 'I', 'see', 'vividly', 'peculiar', 'pattern', 'overcoat', 'dead', 'body', 'Mr.', 'Renauld', 'I', 'remember', 'amazing', 'likeness', 'startle', 'believe', 'one', 'instant', 'dead', 'man', 'rise', 'dead', 'son', 'burst', 'conclave', 'salon', 'go', 'repeat', 'girl', 'steadily', 'I', 'fancy', 'back', 'recognize', 'think', 'recognize', 'the', 'gait', 'carriage', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'overcoat', 'I', 'pause', 'you', 'tell', 'train', 'way', 'Paris', 'italian', 'blood', 'vein', 'nearly', 'get', 'trouble', 'you', 'use', 'threat', 'one', 'letter', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'when', 'see', 'anger', 'jealousy', 'drive', 'mad', 'strike', 'I', 'not', 'believe', 'minute', 'mean', 'kill', 'but', 'kill', 'Cinderella', 'she', 'fling', 'hand', 'cover', 'face', 'choke', 'voice', 'say', 'you', '’re', 'right', '…', '’re', 'right', '…', 'I', 'see', 'tell', 'then', 'turn', 'almost']"

Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that—a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know—ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could. “Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true—but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief.

I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “_Mon ami___,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “_Mon Dieu!___ no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! _Eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.” “There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _Eh bien!___ it comes to this—are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer.

He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come—not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well—I warned you. When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “_Mon ami!

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,1,"After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea—had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight","['after', 'moment', 'stress', 'I', 'describe', 'reaction', 'bind', 'set', 'I', 'retire', 'rest', 'night', 'note', 'triumph', 'I', 'awake', 'realize', 'I', 'mean', 'wood', 'true', 'I', 'could', 'see', 'flaw', 'alibi', 'I', 'suddenly', 'conceive', 'I', 'stick', 'story', 'I', 'fail', 'see', 'Bella', 'could', 'convict', 'face', 'it', 'though', 'old', 'friendship', 'we', 'could', 'rake', 'might', 'lead', 'suspect', 'I', 'commit', 'perjury', 'it', 'could', 'prove', 'actual', 'fact', 'I', 'see', 'girl', 'three', 'occasion', 'no', 'I', 'still', 'satisfied', 'idea', 'even', 'Poirot', 'admit', 'defeat', 'but', 'I', 'feel', 'need', 'treading', 'warily', 'all', 'well', 'little', 'friend', 'admit', 'momentarily', 'nonplus', 'I', 'far', 'much', 'respect', 'ability', 'conceive', 'content', 'remain', 'position', 'I', 'humble', 'opinion', 'wit', 'come', 'match', 'Poirot', 'would', 'take', 'defeat', 'lie', 'somehow', 'would', 'endeavour', 'turn', 'table', 'way', 'moment', 'I', 'least', 'expect', 'we', 'meet', 'breakfast', 'follow', 'morning', 'though', 'nothing', 'happen', 'Poirot', '’s', 'good', 'temper', 'imperturbable', 'yet', 'I', 'think', 'I', 'detect', 'film', 'reserve', 'manner', 'new', 'after', 'breakfast', 'I', 'announce', 'intention', 'go', 'stroll', 'a', 'malicious', 'gleam', 'shot', 'Poirot', '’s', 'eye', 'if', 'information', 'seek', 'need', 'pain', 'derange', 'I', 'tell', 'wish', 'know', 'the', 'Dulcibella', 'Sisters', 'cancel', 'contract', 'leave', 'Coventry', 'unknown', 'destination', 'be', 'really', 'Poirot', 'you', 'take', 'Hastings', 'I', 'make', 'inquiry', 'first', 'thing', 'morning', 'after', 'else', 'expect', 'true', 'enough', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'expect', 'circumstance', 'Cinderella', 'profit', 'slight']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,2,"start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being. But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well—something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No—let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act—but I could not rest easy in my mind. Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what","['start', 'I', 'able', 'assure', 'would', 'certainly', 'lose', 'moment', 'remove', 'reach', 'pursuer', 'it', 'I', 'intend', 'plan', 'nevertheless', 'I', 'aware', 'plunge', 'network', 'fresh', 'difficulty', 'I', 'absolutely', 'mean', 'communicate', 'girl', 'vital', 'know', 'line', 'defence', 'occur', 'I', 'prepared', 'carry', 'of', 'course', 'possible', 'might', 'try', 'send', 'word', 'way', 'another', 'I', 'hardly', 'think', 'likely', 'she', 'would', 'know', 'risk', 'run', 'message', 'intercept', 'Poirot', 'thus', 'set', 'track', 'clearly', 'course', 'disappear', 'utterly', 'time', 'but', 'meantime', 'Poirot', 'I', 'study', 'attentively', 'he', 'wear', 'innocent', 'air', 'stare', 'meditatively', 'far', 'distance', 'he', 'look', 'altogether', 'placid', 'supine', 'give', 'reassurance', 'I', 'learn', 'Poirot', 'less', 'dangerous', 'look', 'dangerous', 'his', 'quiescence', 'alarm', 'observe', 'troubled', 'quality', 'glance', 'smile', 'benignantly', 'you', 'puzzle', 'Hastings', 'you', 'ask', 'I', 'launch', 'pursuit', 'well', 'something', 'kind', 'it', 'would', 'place', 'I', 'understand', 'but', 'I', 'enjoy', 'rush', 'country', 'seek', 'needle', 'haystack', 'English', 'say', 'no', 'let', 'Mademoiselle', 'Bella', 'Duveen', 'go', 'without', 'doubt', 'I', 'shall', 'able', 'find', 'time', 'come', 'until', 'I', 'content', 'wait', 'I', 'stare', 'doubtfully', 'be', 'seek', 'mislead', 'I', 'irritate', 'feeling', 'even', 'master', 'situation', 'my', 'sense', 'superiority', 'gradually', 'wane', 'I', 'contrive', 'girl', '’s', 'escape', 'evolve', 'brilliant', 'scheme', 'save', 'consequence', 'rash', 'act', 'I', 'could', 'rest', 'easy', 'mind', 'Poirot', '’s', 'perfect', 'calm', 'awaken', 'thousand', 'apprehension', 'I', 'suppose', 'Poirot', 'I', 'say', 'rather', 'diffidently', 'I', 'must', 'not', 'ask']"

We return to France without delay.” “_We?___” “Precisely—‘_we!___’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish—” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard—which every one would perceive, _bien entendu___—I much prefer that we should voyage together. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you—” “I know—I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know—what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still—” I began, and stopped. “Still—as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,4,"of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience—horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,5,"there still remained a cold fear. 24 “Save Him!” We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did—eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “_Eh bien___, speaking frankly—in confidence, _c’est entendu___—can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as—?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with _empressement___. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much.","['still', 'remain', 'cold', 'fear', '24', 'save', 'he', 'we', 'cross', 'England', 'evening', 'boat', 'follow', 'morning', 'see', 'we', 'Saint', 'Omer', 'whither', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'take', 'Poirot', 'lose', 'time', 'visit', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'as', 'seem', 'disposed', 'make', 'objection', 'accompany', 'I', 'bear', 'company', 'after', 'various', 'formality', 'preliminary', 'conduct', 'examine', 'magistrate', '’s', 'room', 'he', 'greet', 'we', 'cordially', 'I', 'tell', 'return', 'England', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'I', 'glad', 'find', 'case', 'it', 'true', 'I', 'go', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'fly', 'visit', 'a', 'side', 'issue', 'one', 'I', 'fancy', 'might', 'repay', 'investigation', 'and', 'eh', 'Poirot', 'shrug', 'shoulder', 'M.', 'Hautet', 'nod', 'sigh', 'we', 'must', 'resign', 'I', 'fear', 'that', 'animal', 'Giraud', 'manner', 'abominable', 'undoubtedly', 'clever', 'not', 'much', 'chance', 'one', 'make', 'mistake', 'you', 'think', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'it', 'examine', 'magistrate', '’s', 'turn', 'shrug', 'shoulder', 'eh', 'bien', 'speak', 'frankly', 'confidence', 'c’est', 'entendu___—can', 'come', 'conclusion', 'frankly', 'M.', 'le', 'juge', 'seem', 'many', 'point', 'obscure', 'such', 'but', 'Poirot', 'draw', 'I', 'yet', 'tabulate', 'remark', 'it', 'general', 'reflection', 'I', 'make', 'I', 'like', 'young', 'man', 'sorry', 'believe', 'guilty', 'hideous', 'crime', 'by', 'way', 'say', 'matter', 'the', 'magistrate', 'frown', 'I', 'understand', 'he', 'seem', 'incapable', 'put', 'sort', 'defence', 'it', 'difficult', 'get', 'answer', 'question', 'he', 'content', 'general', 'denial', 'beyond', 'take', 'refuge', 'obstinate', 'silence', 'I', 'interrogate', 'tomorrow', 'perhaps', 'would', 'like', 'present', 'we', 'accept', 'invitation', 'empressement', 'a', 'distressing', 'case', 'say', 'magistrate', 'sigh', 'my', 'sympathy', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'profound', 'how', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'she', 'yet', 'recover', 'consciousness', 'it', 'merciful', 'way', 'poor', 'woman', 'spare', 'much']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,6,"The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all—no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “_A demain___ then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike—rude, sneering fellows. They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my—er—experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain—_flair___. _Enfin!___ the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I—eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M.

His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “_Pardon!___ But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment—then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “_Toqué!___” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “_Toqué!___” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy—you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. _Eh bien___, once or twice, _your___ manner has annoyed _me___.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly","['see', 'say', 'Poirot', 'the', 'end', 'case', 'far', 'I', 'fancy', 'I', 'agree', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'Poirot', 'speak', 'subdue', 'tone', 'his', 'crest', 'fall', 'manner', 'seem', 'delight', 'of', 'milk', 'water', 'criminal', 'not', 'idea', 'defend', 'it', 'extraordinary', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'give', 'one', 'think', 'suggest', 'Poirot', 'mildly', 'but', 'Giraud', 'even', 'listen', 'he', 'twirl', 'cane', 'amicably', 'well', 'good', 'day', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'I', 'glad', '’re', 'satisfied', 'young', 'Renauld', '’s', 'guilt', 'last', 'Pardon', 'but', 'I', 'least', 'satisfied', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'innocent', 'Giraud', 'stare', 'moment', 'burst', 'laugh', 'tap', 'head', 'significantly', 'brief', 'remark', 'Toqué', 'Poirot', 'draw', 'a', 'dangerous', 'light', 'show', 'eye', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'throughout', 'case', 'manner', 'deliberately', 'insulting', 'you', 'need', 'teach', 'lesson', 'I', 'prepared', 'wager', '500', 'franc', 'I', 'find', 'murderer', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'be', 'agree', 'Giraud', 'stare', 'helplessly', 'murmur', 'Toqué', 'come', 'urge', 'Poirot', 'agree', 'I', 'wish', 'take', 'money', 'make', 'mind', 'easy', 'oh', 'well', 'I', 'agree', 'you', 'speak', 'manner', 'insulting', 'eh', 'bien', 'twice', 'manner', 'annoy', 'I', 'enchant', 'hear', 'say', 'Poirot', 'good', 'morning', 'M.', 'Giraud', 'Come', 'Hastings', 'I', 'say', 'word', 'walk', 'along', 'street', 'my', 'heart', 'heavy', 'Poirot', 'display', 'intention', 'plainly', 'I', 'doubt', 'ever', 'power', 'save', 'Bella', 'consequence', 'act', 'this', 'unlucky', 'encounter', 'Giraud', 'rouse', 'Poirot', 'put', 'mettle', 'suddenly', 'I', 'feel', 'hand', 'lay', 'shoulder', 'turn', 'face', 'Gabriel', 'Stonor', 'we', 'stop', 'greet', 'propose', 'stroll', 'we', 'back', 'hotel', 'and', 'M.', 'Stonor', 'inquire', 'Poirot', 'one', 'must', 'stand', 'one', '’s', 'friend', 'reply', 'dryly', 'especially', 'unjustly', 'accuse', 'then', 'believe', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'commit', 'crime', 'I', 'ask', 'eagerly', 'certainly']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,8,"I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal—no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he _wanted___ to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger—” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs.","['I', 'n’t', 'I', 'know', 'lad', 'I', 'admit', 'one', 'two', 'thing', 'business', 'stagger', 'completely', 'none', 'less', 'spite', 'fool', 'way', 'take', 'I', '’ll', 'never', 'believe', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'murderer', 'my', 'heart', 'warm', 'secretary', 'his', 'word', 'seem', 'lift', 'secret', 'weight', 'heart', 'I', 'doubt', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'I', 'exclaim', 'there', 'really', 'absurdly', 'little', 'evidence', 'I', 'say', 'doubt', 'acquittal', 'doubt', 'whatever', 'but', 'Stonor', 'hardly', 'respond', 'I', 'could', 'wish', 'I', '’d', 'give', 'lot', 'think', 'say', 'gravely', 'he', 'turn', 'Poirot', 'what', '’', 'opinion', 'monsieur', 'I', 'think', 'thing', 'look', 'black', 'say', 'Poirot', 'quietly', 'you', 'believe', 'guilty', 'say', 'Stonor', 'sharply', 'no', 'but', 'I', 'think', 'find', 'hard', 'prove', 'innocence', 'he', '’s', 'behave', 'damned', 'queerly', 'mutter', 'Stonor', 'of', 'course', 'I', 'realize', '’', 'lot', 'affair', 'meet', 'eye', 'Giraud', '’s', 'wise', '’', 'outsider', 'whole', 'thing', 'damn', 'odd', 'as', 'least', 'say', 'soon', 'mend', 'if', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'want', 'hush', 'anything', 'I', '’ll', 'take', 'cue', 'it', '’', 'show', 'I', '’ve', 'much', 'respect', 'judgment', 'shove', 'oar', 'I', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'behind', 'attitude', 'Jack', '’s', 'any', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'want', 'think', 'guilty', 'but', '’', 'absurd', 'I', 'cry', 'burst', 'for', 'one', 'thing', 'dagger', 'I', 'pause', 'uncertain', 'much', 'Poirot', 'would', 'wish', 'reveal', 'I', 'continue', 'choose', 'word', 'carefully', 'we', 'know', 'dagger', 'could', 'Jack', 'Renauld', '’s', 'possession', 'evening', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'know', 'true', 'say', 'Stonor', 'when', 'recover', 'doubtless', 'say', 'well', 'I', 'must', 'leave', 'one', 'moment', 'Poirot', '’s', 'hand', 'arrest', 'departure', 'can', 'arrange', 'word', 'send', 'Madame', 'renauld', 'recover', 'consciousness', 'certainly', 'that', '’s', 'easily', 'do', 'that', 'point', 'dagger', 'good', 'Poirot', 'I', 'urge', 'go', 'upstairs']"

We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. _Eh bien___, Hastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but _three___.” “So that—?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, _mon ami?___” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! _Sapristi!___ But it is miracles you ask from me. No—say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “_Dear M. Poirot:___ “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn to, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees to help us. “MARTHE DAUBREUIL.” I handed it back, moved. “You will go?” “At once. We will command an auto.” Half an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come—it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do.

Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down—like _that___.” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he—but what do men care—if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so—but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.” “Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, _petite___, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound.

Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us. The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient _greffier___ sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?”","['we', 'present', 'follow', 'morning', 'examination', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'short', 'time', 'I', 'shock', 'change', 'take', 'place', 'young', 'prisoner', 'his', 'cheek', 'fall', 'deep', 'black', 'circle', 'round', 'eye', 'look', 'haggard', 'distraught', 'one', 'woo', 'sleep', 'vain', 'several', 'night', 'he', 'betray', 'emotion', 'see', 'we', 'the', 'prisoner', 'counsel', 'Maître', 'Grosíer', 'accommodate', 'chair', 'a', 'formidable', 'guard', 'resplendent', 'sabre', 'stand', 'door', 'the', 'patient', 'greffier', 'sit', 'desk', 'the', 'examination', 'begin', 'Renauld', 'begin', 'magistrate', 'deny', 'Merlinville', 'night', 'crime']"

I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner.

The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld. “These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Nothing.” M.

He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of.

So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession.

He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed.

Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your—feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment.

His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say—she doesn’t say—well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, _mon ami___.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not!

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,1,"“Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the hand. Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated—before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan looks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “_Eh ma foi!___ and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.” “He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me horribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence. But, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?” “If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself unduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the _crime passionnel___. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you—” “I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I _do___ feel guilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this girl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat. I can’t help feeling responsible for his death.

After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that—well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself. I just drifted, in fact—not realizing that I was driving the poor kid desperate. If she’d really knifed me, as she meant to, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she’s come forward now is downright plucky. I’d have stood the racket, you know—up to the end.” He was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack: “What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night.

As for the rest, I will explain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?” “There’s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in order to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The train was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf links.

I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then—and then—I looked up and saw _her___. She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost—it’s what she must have thought me at first—all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot. “How would it be if you went on first—to break the news to my mother that I am free—” “While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?” finished Poirot, with a twinkle. “But yes, by all means, I was about to propose such an arrangement myself.” Jack Renauld did not wait for more.

And were met by the news of M. Renauld’s murder?” “Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have happened since then—especially for you, _mon ami!___” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel—I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The _mise en scène___ designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the _dénouement___—ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger—ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old woman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the _salon___. It was some time before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave. “_Vous voilà___, Hastings! _Sacré tonnerre___, but there are squalls ahead!” “What do you mean?” I cried. “I would hardly have credited it,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “but women are very unexpected.” “Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,” I exclaimed, looking out of the window. Poirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps outside. “Do not enter. It is better not.

It is better not.” “But Marthe and I—” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs. Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded—totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite.

My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an equally excellent _entrecôte___ to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length _café noir___ had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little _salon___.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say—” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us.

Poirot cleared his throat. “_Mes enfants___,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start—for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “_Très bien, mon enfant___,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle—” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same,","['mine', 'my', 'eye', 'say', 'rest', 'Poirot', 'clear', 'throat', 'Mes', 'enfant', 'say', 'moment', 'time', 'sentiment', 'there', 'work', 'ahead', 'we', 'Mademoiselle', 'able', 'I', 'ask', 'in', 'response', 'Cinderella', 'take', 'bag', 'object', 'wrap', 'paper', 'hand', 'silently', 'Poirot', 'the', 'latter', 'unwrap', 'I', 'give', 'start', 'aeroplane', 'dagger', 'I', 'understand', 'cast', 'sea', 'strange', 'reluctant', 'woman', 'always', 'destroy', 'compromising', 'object', 'document', 'Très', 'bien', 'mon', 'enfant', 'say', 'Poirot', 'I', 'pleased', 'go', 'rest', 'Hastings', 'I', 'work', 'you', 'shall', 'see', 'tomorrow', 'where', 'go', 'ask', 'girl', 'eye', 'widen', 'you', 'shall', 'hear', 'tomorrow', 'because', 'wherever', '’re', 'go', 'I', '’m', 'come', 'but', 'mademoiselle', 'I', '’m', 'come', 'I', 'tell', 'Poirot', 'realize', 'futile', 'argue', 'he', 'give', 'come', 'mademoiselle', 'but', 'amusing', 'in', 'probability', 'nothing', 'happen', 'the', 'girl', 'make', 'reply', 'twenty', 'minute', 'later', 'set', 'forth', 'it', 'quite', 'dark', 'close', 'oppressive', 'evening', 'Poirot', 'lead', 'way', 'town', 'direction', 'Villa', 'Geneviève', 'but', 'reach', 'Villa', 'Marguerite', 'pause', 'I', 'like', 'assure', 'go', 'well', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'come', 'Hastings', 'Mademoiselle', 'perhaps', 'remain', 'outside', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'might', 'say', 'something', 'would', 'wound', 'we', 'unlatche', 'gate', 'walk', 'path', 'as', 'go', 'round', 'side', 'house', 'I', 'draw', 'Poirot', '’s', 'attention', 'window', 'first', 'floor', 'throw', 'sharply', 'blind', 'profile', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', 'ah', 'say', 'Poirot', 'I', 'figure', 'room', 'shall', 'find', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'Madame', 'Daubreuil', 'open', 'door', 'we', 'she', 'explain', 'Jack', 'much']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,8,"but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping—that is the great thing. _Maman___ made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.” “By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why—” I began. “No ‘_whys___,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,9,"Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But—” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the—” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “_Mille tonnerres!___” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space.

To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t! I’ve got you—and my wrists are just like steel.” At the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Françoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is—the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil!","['to', 'horror', 'I', 'see', 'hang', 'hand', 'roof', 'propel', 'along', 'jerk', 'direction', 'lighted', 'window', 'good', 'heaven', 'she', '’ll', 'kill', 'I', 'cry', 'you', 'forget', 'she', '’', 'professional', 'acrobat', 'Hastings', 'it', 'providence', 'good', 'God', 'make', 'insist', 'come', 'we', 'tonight', 'I', 'pray', 'may', 'time', 'ah', 'a', 'cry', 'absolute', 'terror', 'float', 'night', 'girl', 'disappear', 'right', 'hand', 'window', 'Cinderella', '’s', 'clear', 'tone', 'come', 'word', 'no', 'n’t', 'I', '’ve', 'get', 'wrist', 'like', 'steel', 'at', 'moment', 'door', 'prison', 'open', 'cautiously', 'Françoise', 'Poirot', 'brush', 'aside', 'unceremoniously', 'rush', 'passage', 'maid', 'group', 'round', 'door', 'it', '’s', 'lock', 'inside', 'monsieur', 'there', 'sound', 'heavy', 'fall', 'within', 'after', 'moment', 'two', 'key', 'turned', 'door', 'swing', 'slowly', 'open', 'Cinderella', 'pale', 'beckon', 'we', 'she', 'safe', 'demand', 'Poirot', 'yes', 'I', 'time', 'she', 'exhaust', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'half', 'sit', 'half', 'lie', 'bed', 'she', 'gasp', 'breath', 'nearly', 'strangle', 'murmur', 'painfully', 'the', 'girl', 'pick', 'something', 'floor', 'hand', 'Poirot', 'it', 'roll', 'ladder', 'silk', 'rope', 'fine', 'quite', 'strong', 'a', 'getaway', 'say', 'Poirot', 'by', 'window', 'whilst', 'batter', 'door', 'where', 'the', 'girl', 'stand', 'aside', 'little', 'pointed', 'on', 'ground', 'lie', 'figure', 'wrap', 'dark', 'material', 'fold', 'hide', 'face', 'dead', 'she', 'nod', 'I', 'think', 'Head', 'must', 'strike', 'marble', 'fender', 'but', 'I', 'cry', 'the', 'murderer', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'Hastings', 'and', 'would', 'murderer', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'puzzled', 'uncomprehending', 'I', 'kneel', 'lift', 'fold', 'cloth', 'look', 'dead', 'beautiful', 'face', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,1,"I have confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you _must___ have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room—her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations—they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you—why—was—I—not—told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child—” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour—slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a _garde-malad___.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them.

I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “_Enfin___ you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said. “Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did—yes—but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans.

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,3,"facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife. So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper—which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him.","['fact', 'fail', 'support', 'theory', 'guilt', 'be', 'one', 'else', 'might', 'know', 'yes', 'from', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', '’s', 'lip', 'admission', 'overhear', 'M.', 'Renauld', '’s', 'quarrel', 'tramp', 'if', 'could', 'overhear', 'reason', 'hear', 'everything', 'else', 'especially', 'M.', 'Madame', 'Renauld', 'imprudent', 'enough', 'discuss', 'plan', 'sit', 'bench', 'remember', 'easily', 'overheard', 'Marthe', '’s', 'conversation', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'spot', 'but', 'possible', 'motive', 'could', 'Marthe', 'murder', 'Mr.', 'Renauld', 'I', 'argue', 'what', 'motive', 'money', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'millionaire', 'several', 'time', 'death', 'Jack', 'believe', 'half', 'vast', 'fortune', 'would', 'pass', 'son', 'let', 'we', 'reconstruct', 'scene', 'standpoint', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', 'overhear', 'pass', 'Renauld', 'wife', 'so', 'far', 'nice', 'little', 'source', 'income', 'Daubreuil', 'mother', 'daughter', 'propose', 'escape', 'toil', 'at', 'first', 'possibly', 'idea', 'prevent', 'escape', 'but', 'bold', 'idea', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'fail', 'horrify', 'daughter', 'Jeanne', 'Beroldy', 'at', 'present', 'M.', 'Renauld', 'stand', 'inexorably', 'way', 'marriage', 'Jack', 'if', 'latter', 'defy', 'father', 'pauper', 'mind', 'Mademoiselle', 'Marthe', 'in', 'fact', 'I', 'doubt', 'ever', 'care', 'straw', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'she', 'simulate', 'emotion', 'reality', 'cold', 'calculate', 'type', 'mother', 'I', 'doubt', 'whether', 'really', 'sure', 'hold', 'boy', '’s', 'affection', 'she', 'dazzle', 'captivate', 'separate', 'father', 'could', 'easily', 'manage', 'separate', 'might', 'lose']"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,4,"But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth—not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death—she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil—the dagger! Jack Renauld had _three___ souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans. “(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have killed M.

And yet—I was not satisfied, _mon ami___. _I was not satisfied.…___ “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before.

But if, by any chance, it was _not___ her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil—why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact!

By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune.

It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève—and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “_Eh bien___, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect—triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, _mon ami!___ On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine.

Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!’ “However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated—not by Hercule Poirot—but by _la petite acrobate___ with her wrists of steel.” I mused over the whole story. “When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?” Poirot smiled. “My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. _The girl with the anxious eyes!___ Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld’s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.” “By the way,” I exclaimed, “how is Jack Renauld?” “Much better.

And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.” “Has Jack Renauld been—told?” “Not yet.” “It will be a terrible shock to him.” “Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth. Marthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack, and she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the truth he will be horrified—revolted, and his false love will wither away.” “What about Giraud?” “He has a _crise___ of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to return to Paris.” We both smiled. Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved","['daughter', 'think', 'we', 'shall', 'never', 'know', 'Madame', 'lady', 'keep', 'secret', 'and', 'I', 'doubt', 'much', 'police', 'ever', 'find', 'have', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'tell', 'not', 'yet', 'it', 'terrible', 'shock', 'naturally', 'and', 'yet', 'know', 'Hastings', 'I', 'doubt', 'heart', 'ever', 'seriously', 'engage', 'so', 'far', 'look', 'upon', 'Bella', 'Duveen', 'siren', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', 'girl', 'really', 'love', 'but', 'I', 'think', 'reverse', 'term', 'come', 'near', 'truth', 'Marthe', 'Daubreuil', 'beautiful', 'she', 'set', 'fascinate', 'Jack', 'succeed', 'remember', 'curious', 'reluctance', 'break', 'girl', 'and', 'see', 'willing', 'go', 'guillotine', 'rather', 'implicate', 'I', 'little', 'idea', 'learn', 'truth', 'horrify', 'revolt', 'false', 'love', 'wither', 'away', 'what', 'Giraud', 'he', 'crise', 'nerve', 'one', 'he', 'oblige', 'return', 'Paris', 'we', 'smile', 'Poirot', 'prove', 'fairly', 'true', 'prophet', 'when', 'length', 'doctor', 'pronounce', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'strong', 'enough', 'hear', 'truth', 'Poirot', 'break', 'the', 'shock', 'indeed', 'terrific', 'yet', 'Jack', 'rally', 'well', 'I', 'could', 'suppose', 'possible', 'his', 'mother', '’s', 'devotion', 'help', 'live', 'difficult', 'day', 'the', 'mother', 'son', 'inseparable', 'there', 'revelation', 'come', 'Poirot', 'acquaint', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'fact', 'know', 'secret', 'represent', 'Jack', 'leave', 'ignorance', 'father', '’s', 'past', 'to', 'hide', 'truth', 'never', 'avail', 'madame', 'be', 'brave', 'tell', 'everything', 'with', 'heavy', 'heart', 'Mrs.', 'Renauld', 'consent', 'son', 'learn', 'father', 'love']"

The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot’s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. “_Mais, oui!___ I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I call him Giraud!” A few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face. “M. Poirot, I’ve come to say good-bye. I’m sailing for South America almost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent, and I mean to start a new life out there.” “You go alone, M. Jack?” “My mother comes with me—and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean—?” “A girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and—oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “_Les femmes___—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but—I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time","['actual', 'fact', 'fugitive', 'justice', 'a', 'halting', 'question', 'promptly', 'answer', 'Poirot', 'reassure', 'M.', 'Jack', 'the', 'world', 'know', 'nothing', 'as', 'far', 'I', 'see', 'obligation', 'take', 'police', 'confidence', 'throughout', 'case', 'I', 'act', 'father', 'justice', 'overtake', 'last', 'one', 'need', 'ever', 'know', 'Georges', 'Conneau', 'one', 'there', 'course', 'various', 'point', 'case', 'remain', 'puzzle', 'police', 'Poirot', 'explain', 'thing', 'plausible', 'fashion', 'query', 'gradually', 'still', 'shortly', 'get', 'back', 'London', 'I', 'notice', 'magnificent', 'model', 'foxhound', 'adorn', 'Poirot', '’s', 'mantelpiece', 'in', 'answer', 'inquire', 'glance', 'Poirot', 'nod', 'Mais', 'oui', 'I', 'get', '500', 'franc', 'be', 'splendid', 'fellow', 'I', 'call', 'Giraud', 'a', 'day', 'later', 'Jack', 'Renauld', 'come', 'see', 'we', 'resolute', 'expression', 'face', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'I', '’ve', 'come', 'say', 'good', 'bye', 'I', '’m', 'sail', 'South', 'America', 'almost', 'immediately', 'my', 'father', 'large', 'interest', 'continent', 'I', 'mean', 'start', 'new', 'life', 'you', 'go', 'alone', 'M.', 'Jack', 'my', 'mother', 'come', 'I', 'shall', 'keep', 'Stonor', 'secretary', 'he', 'like', 'way', 'part', 'world', 'no', 'one', 'else', 'go', 'Jack', 'flush', 'you', 'mean', 'a', 'girl', 'love', 'dearly', 'willing', 'lay', 'life', 'how', 'could', 'I', 'ask', 'mutter', 'boy', 'after', 'happen', 'could', 'I', 'go', 'oh', 'sort', 'lame', 'story', 'could', 'I', 'tell', 'Les', 'femmes___—they', 'wonderful', 'genius', 'manufacturing', 'crutch', 'story', 'like', 'yes', 'I’ve', 'damned', 'fool', 'so', 'we', 'one', 'time']"

Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity—” “Well, then—” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice—” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back—and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar. So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but—” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all—” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince—and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word.","['another', 'observe', 'Poirot', 'philosophically', 'but', 'Jack', '’s', 'face', 'harden', 'there', '’', 'something', 'else', 'I', '’m', 'father', '’s', 'son', 'would', 'one', 'marry', 'know', 'you', 'father', '’s', 'son', 'say', 'Hastings', 'tell', 'I', 'believe', 'heredity', 'well', 'wait', 'I', 'know', 'woman', 'woman', 'courage', 'endurance', 'capable', 'great', 'love', 'supreme', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'the', 'boy', 'look', 'his', 'eye', 'soften', 'my', 'mother', 'yes', 'you', 'mother', '’s', 'son', 'well', 'father', '’s', 'go', 'Mademoiselle', 'Bella', 'tell', 'everything', 'keep', 'nothing', 'back', 'see', 'say', 'Jack', 'look', 'irresolute', 'go', 'boy', 'long', 'man', 'man', 'bow', 'fate', 'Past', 'fate', 'Today', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'wonderful', 'life', 'ask', 'share', 'you', 'may', 'realize', 'love', 'test', 'fire', 'find', 'want', 'you', 'willing', 'lay', 'life', 'and', 'Captain', 'Arthur', 'Hastings', 'humble', 'chronicler', 'page', 'there', 'talk', 'join', 'renauld', 'ranch', 'across', 'sea', 'end', 'story', 'I', 'prefer', 'go', 'back', 'morning', 'garden', 'Villa', 'Geneviève', 'I', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'Bella', 'I', 'say', 'since', 'n’t', 'name', 'and', 'Dulcie', 'seem', 'unfamiliar', 'so', '’s', 'get', 'Cinderella', 'Cinderella', 'marry', 'Prince', 'remember', 'I', '’m', 'Prince', 'she', 'interrupt', 'Cinderella', 'warn', 'I', '’m', 'sure', 'you', 'see', 'could', 'not', 'promise', 'turn', 'princess', 'she', 'little', 'scullion', 'it', '’', 'Prince', '’s', 'turn', 'interrupt', 'I', 'interpolate', 'do', 'know', 'say', 'no', 'Hell', 'say', 'Prince', 'kiss', 'and', 'I', 'suit', 'action', 'word']"

""You are, perhaps naturally, prejudiced."" He took up his hat and stick and moved towards the door. ""Giving advice is not much in my line."" He delivered his final thrust. ""But, in this case, I should advise most strongly perfect frankness between father and daughter."" He passed quickly out of the room and shut the door behind him just as the millionaire sprang up. ""Now, what the hell did he mean by that?"" said Van Aldin as he sank back into his chair again. All his uneasiness returned in full force. There was something here that he had not yet got to the bottom of. The telephone was by his elbow; he seized it, and asked for the number of his daughter's house. ""Hallo! Hallo! Is that Mayfair 81907? Mrs. Kettering in? Oh, she's out, is she? Yes, out to lunch. What time will she be in? You don't know? Oh, very good; no, there's no message.""

As he was walking along Curzon Street, a figure came out of No. 160, and turned up the street towards him, so that they passed each other on the pavement. For a moment, the millionaire had fancied it might be Derek Kettering himself; the height and build were not unlike. But as they came face to face, he saw that the man was a stranger to him. At least--no, not a stranger; his face awoke some call of recognition in the millionaire's mind, and it was associated definitely with something unpleasant. He cudgelled his brains in vain, but the thing eluded him. He went on, shaking his head irritably. He hated to be baffled. Ruth Kettering was clearly expecting him. She ran to him and kissed him when he entered. ""Well, Dad, how are things going?"" ""Very well,"" said Van Aldin; ""but I have got a word or two to say to you, Ruth."" Almost insensibly he felt the change in her; something shrewd and watchful replaced the impulsiveness of her greeting. She sat down in a big arm-chair. ""Well, Dad?"" she asked. ""What is it?"" ""I saw your husband this morning,"" said Van Aldin. ""You saw Derek?"" ""I did. He said a lot of things, most of which were darned cheek.

He had a solitary lunch, and after it, frowning to himself a little, he went around to the sumptuous flat that housed the lady known as Mirelle. A trim Frenchwoman received him with smiles. ""But enter then, Monsieur. Madame reposes herself."" He was ushered into the long room with its Eastern setting which he knew so well.

They arrived full of hope and they usually left in tears. But from the moment Katherine Grey set foot in Little Crampton, ten years ago, perfect peace had reigned. No one knows how these things come about. Snake-charmers, they say, are born, not made. Katherine Grey was born with the power of managing old ladies, dogs, and small boys, and she did it without any apparent sense of strain. At twenty-three she had been a quiet girl with beautiful eyes. At thirty-three she was a quiet woman, with those same grey eyes, shining steadily out on the world with a kind of happy serenity that nothing could shake. Moreover, she had been born with, and still possessed, a sense of humour. As she sat at the breakfast-table, staring in front of her, there was a ring at the bell, accompanied by a very energetic rat-a-tat-tat at the knocker. In another minute the little maid-servant opened the door and announced rather breathlessly: ""Dr. Harrison.""

A branch of golden mimosa, hanging just above her head, made an effective frame for a very charming picture. A golden-haired, blue-eyed lady in a very becoming negligee. That the golden hair owed something to art, as did the pink-and-white complexion, was undeniable, but the blue of the eyes was Nature's gift, and at forty-four Lady Tamplin could still rank as a beauty. Charming as she looked, Lady Tamplin was, for once, not thinking of herself. That is to say, she was not thinking of her appearance. She was intent on graver matters. Lady Tamplin was a well-known figure on the Riviera, and her parties at the Villa Marguerite were justly celebrated. She was a woman of considerable experience, and had had four husbands. The first had been merely an indiscretion, and so was seldom referred to by the lady. He had had the good sense to die with commendable promptitude, and his widow thereupon espoused a rich manufacturer of buttons. He too had departed for another sphere after three years of married life--it was said after a congenial evening with some boon companions.

This fourth venture had been undertaken for pure pleasure. Mr. Charles Evans, an extremely good-looking young man of twenty-seven, with delightful manners, a keen love of sport, and an appreciation of this world's goods, had no money of his own whatsoever. Lady Tamplin was very pleased and satisfied with life generally, but she had occasional faint preoccupations about money. The button manufacturer had left his widow a considerable fortune, but, as Lady Tamplin was wont to say, ""what with one thing and another--"" (one thing being the depreciation of stocks owing to the War, and the other the extravagances of the late Lord Tamplin). She was still comfortably off. But to be merely comfortably off is hardly satisfactory to one of Rosalie Tamplin's temperament.

She carried her point, though the lawyer was still unwilling, and she presently went out into the streets of London with a comfortable assurance that she could spend money freely and make what plans she liked for the future. Her first action was to visit the establishment of a famous dressmaker. A slim, elderly Frenchwoman, rather like a dreaming duchess, received her, and Katherine spoke with a certain _naïveté_.

Some people it would offend them if I said that, but Mademoiselle, no. _Une belle Anglaise_, there is no style more delightful."" The demeanour of a dreaming duchess was suddenly put off.

Marcelle, Clothilde, Virginie, bored and scornful, passed slowly round, squirming and wriggling in the time-honoured fashion of mannequins. The Duchess stood by Katherine and made entries in a small notebook. ""An excellent choice, Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle has great _goût_. Yes, indeed.

Very perfectly dressed in a long mink coat and a little hat of Chinese lacquer red, she had been walking along the crowded platform of Victoria deep in thought, and her father's sudden appearance and hearty greeting had an unlooked-for effect upon her. ""Why, Ruth, how you jumped!"" ""I didn't expect to see you, I suppose, Dad. You said good-bye to me last night and said you had a conference this morning."" ""So I have,"" said Van Aldin, ""but you are more to me than any number of darned conferences. I came to take a last look at you, since I am not going to see you for some time."" ""That is very sweet of you, Dad. I wish you were coming too."" ""What would you say if I did?"" The remark was merely a joking one. He was surprised to see the quick colour flame in Ruth's cheeks. For a moment he almost thought he saw dismay flash out of her eyes. She laughed uncertainly and nervously. ""Just for a moment I really thought you meant it,"" she said. ""Would you have been pleased?"" ""Of course."" She spoke with exaggerated emphasis. ""Well,"" said Van Aldin, ""that's good."" ""It isn't really for very long, Dad,"" continued Ruth; ""you know, you are coming out next month."" ""Ah!"" said Van Aldin unemotionally, ""sometimes I guess I will go to one of these big guys in Harley Street and have him tell me that I need sunshine and change of air right away."" ""Don't be so lazy,"" cried Ruth; ""next month is ever so much nicer than this month out there. You have got all sorts of things you can't possibly leave just now."" ""Well, that's so, I suppose,"" said Van Aldin, with a sigh. ""You had better be getting on board this train of yours, Ruth. Where is your seat?"" Ruth Kettering looked vaguely up at the train.

""I have put your dressing-case under your seat, Madam, in case you should need it. Shall I take the rugs, or will you require one?"" ""No, no, I shan't want one. Better go and find your own seat now, Mason."" ""Yes, Madam."" The maid departed. Van Aldin entered the Pullman car with Ruth. She found her seat, and Van Aldin deposited various papers and magazines on the table in front of her. The seat opposite to her was already taken, and the American gave a cursory glance at its occupant. He had a fleeting impression of attractive grey eyes and a neat travelling costume. He indulged in a little more desultory conversation with Ruth, the kind of talk peculiar to those seeing other people off by train. Presently, as whistles blew, he glanced at his watch. ""I had best be clearing out of here. Good-bye, my dear. Don't worry, I will attend to things."" ""Oh, father!"" He turned back sharply. There had been something in Ruth's voice, something so entirely foreign to her usual manner, that he was startled. It was almost a cry of despair. She had made an impulsive movement towards him, but in another minute she was mistress of herself once more. ""Till next month,"" she said cheerfully. Two minutes later the train started. Ruth sat very still, biting her under lip and trying hard to keep the unaccustomed tears from her eyes. She felt a sudden sense of horrible desolation. There was a wild longing upon her to jump out of the train and to go back before it was too late. She, so calm, so self-assured, for the first time in her life felt like a leaf swept by the wind. If her father knew--what would he say? Madness! Yes, just that, madness! For the first time in her life she was swept away by emotion, swept away to the point of doing a thing which even she knew to be incredibly foolish","['black', 'stand', '--', 'Ruth', 'Kettering', ""'s"", 'maid', 'she', 'draw', 'aside', 'mistress', 'come', 'I', 'put', 'dressing', 'case', 'seat', 'Madam', 'case', 'need', 'shall', 'I', 'take', 'rug', 'require', 'one', 'no', 'I', 'shall', 'not', 'want', 'one', 'well', 'go', 'find', 'seat', 'Mason', 'yes', 'Madam', 'the', 'maid', 'depart', 'Van', 'Aldin', 'enter', 'Pullman', 'car', 'Ruth', 'she', 'find', 'seat', 'Van', 'Aldin', 'deposit', 'various', 'paper', 'magazine', 'table', 'front', 'the', 'seat', 'opposite', 'already', 'take', 'American', 'give', 'cursory', 'glance', 'occupant', 'he', 'fleeting', 'impression', 'attractive', 'grey', 'eye', 'neat', 'travel', 'costume', 'he', 'indulge', 'little', 'desultory', 'conversation', 'Ruth', 'kind', 'talk', 'peculiar', 'see', 'people', 'train', 'presently', 'whistle', 'blew', 'glance', 'watch', 'I', 'well', 'clear', 'good', 'bye', 'dear', 'do', 'not', 'worry', 'I', 'attend', 'thing', 'oh', 'father', 'he', 'turn', 'back', 'sharply', 'there', 'something', 'Ruth', ""'s"", 'voice', 'something', 'entirely', 'foreign', 'usual', 'manner', 'startle', 'it', 'almost', 'cry', 'despair', 'she', 'make', 'impulsive', 'movement', 'towards', 'another', 'minute', 'mistress', 'till', 'next', 'month', 'say', 'cheerfully', 'two', 'minute', 'later', 'train', 'start', 'Ruth', 'sit', 'still', 'bite', 'lip', 'try', 'hard', 'keep', 'unaccustomed', 'tear', 'eye', 'she', 'feel', 'sudden', 'sense', 'horrible', 'desolation', 'there', 'wild', 'longing', 'upon', 'jump', 'train', 'go', 'back', 'late', 'she', 'calm', 'self', 'assure', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'feel', 'like', 'leaf', 'sweep', 'wind', 'if', 'father', 'know', '--', 'would', 'say', 'madness', 'yes', 'madness', 'for', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'sweep', 'away', 'emotion', 'sweep', 'away', 'point', 'thing', 'even', 'know', 'incredibly', 'foolish']"

But she was his daughter in another sense also. She had that same iron determination that would have what it wanted, and once it had made up its mind would not be balked. From her cradle she had been self-willed; the very circumstances of her life had developed that self-will in her. It drove her now remorselessly. Well, the die was cast. She must go through with it now. She looked up, and her eyes met those of the woman sitting opposite. She had a sudden fancy that in some way this other woman had read her mind. She saw in those grey eyes understanding and--yes--compassion. It was only a fleeting impression. The faces of both women hardened to well-bred impassiveness. Mrs. Kettering took up a magazine, and Katherine Grey looked out of the window and watched a seemingly endless vista of depressing streets and suburban houses. Ruth found an increasing difficulty in fixing her mind on the printed page in front of her. In spite of herself, a thousand apprehensions preyed on her mind. What a fool she had been! What a fool she was! Like all cool and self-sufficient people, when she did lose her self-control she lost it thoroughly. It was too late.... Was it too late? Oh, for some one to speak to, for some one to advise her. She had never before had such a wish; she would have scorned the idea of relying on any judgment other than her own, but now--what was the matter with her? Panic. Yes, that would describe it best--panic. She, Ruth Kettering, was completely and utterly panic stricken. She stole a covert glance at the figure opposite. If only she knew some one like that, some nice, cool, calm, sympathetic creature. That was the sort of person one could talk to. But you can't, of course, confide in a stranger. And Ruth smiled to herself a little at the idea.

What happiness had she ever had in her life up to now? She said to herself restlessly: ""Why shouldn't I be happy? No one will ever know."" It seemed no time before Dover was reached. Ruth was a good sailor. She disliked the cold, and was glad to reach the shelter of the private cabin she had telegraphed for. Although she would not have admitted the fact, Ruth was in some ways superstitious. She was of the order of people to whom coincidence appeals. After disembarking at Calais and settling herself down with her maid in her double compartment in the Blue Train, she went along to the luncheon car. It was with a little shock of surprise that she found herself set down to a small table with, opposite her, the same woman who had been her _vis-à-vis_ in the Pullman. A faint smile came to the lips of both women. ""This is quite a coincidence,"" said Mrs. Kettering. ""I know,"" said Katherine; ""it is odd the way things happen."" A flying attendant shot up to them with the wonderful velocity always displayed by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits and deposited two cups of soup. By the time the omelette succeeded the soup they were chatting together in friendly fashion. ""It will be heavenly to get into the sunshine,"" sighed Ruth. ""I am sure it will be a wonderful feeling."" ""You know the Riviera well?"" ""No; this is my first visit."" ""Fancy that."" ""You go every year, I expect?"" ""Practically. January and February in London are horrible."" ""I have always lived in the country. They are not very inspiring months there either. Mostly mud."" ""What made you suddenly decide to travel?""

Katherine laughed. ""I don't really know. I suppose one forms impressions without thinking of it. I put you down in my own mind as one of the very rich of the earth. It was just an impression. I dare say I am wrong."" ""No,"" said Ruth, ""you are not wrong."" She had suddenly become very grave. ""I wish you would tell me what other impressions you formed about me?"" ""I--"" Ruth swept on disregarding the other's embarrassment. ""Oh, please, don't be conventional. I want to know. As we left Victoria I looked across at you, and I had the sort of feeling that you--well, understood what was going on in my mind."" ""I can assure you I am not a mind reader,"" said Katherine, smiling. ""No; but will you tell me, please, just what you thought."" Ruth's eagerness was so intense and so sincere that she carried her point. ""I will tell you if you like, but you must not think me impertinent.

I--I should like to tell you something about it, if I may."" ""Oh, dear,"" Katherine thought to herself, ""how extraordinarily alike the world seems to be everywhere!

Ruth gulped down her coffee, rose from her seat, and quite oblivious of the fact that Katherine had not begun to sip her coffee, said: ""Come to my compartment with me.""

Oh, well--I don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She certainly won't want to see _me_ again. That is the worst of letting people tell you things. They never do."" She hoped that she would not be given the same place at dinner. She reflected, not without humour, that it might be awkward for both of them. Leaning back with her head against a cushion she felt tired and vaguely depressed. They had reached Paris, and the slow journey round the _ceinture_, with its interminable stops and waits, was very wearisome. When they arrived at the Gare de Lyon she was glad to get out and walk up and down the platform. The keen cold air was refreshing after the steam-heated train. She observed with a smile that her friend of the mink coat was solving the possible awkwardness of the dinner problem in her own way. A dinner basket was being handed up and received through the window by the maid. When the train started once more, and dinner was announced by a violent ringing of bells, Katherine went along to it much relieved in mind. Her _vis-à-vis_ to-night was of an entirely different kind--a small man, distinctly foreign in appearance, with a rigidly waxed moustache and an egg-shaped head which he carried rather on one side. Katherine had taken in a book to dinner with her. She found the little man's eyes fixed upon it with a kind of twinkling amusement. ""I see, Madame, that you have a _roman policier_. You are fond of such things?"" ""They amuse me,"" Katherine admitted. The little man nodded with the air of complete understanding.

Katherine felt more and more amused. ""Perhaps they give one the illusion of living an exciting life,"" she suggested. He nodded gravely. ""Yes; there is something in that."" ""Of course, one knows that such things don't really happen,"" Katherine was continuing, but he interrupted her sharply. ""Sometimes, Mademoiselle! Sometimes! I who speak to you--they have happened to _me_."" She threw him a quick, interested glance. ""Some day, who knows, _you_ might be in the thick of things,"" he went on. ""It is all chance."" ""I don't think it is likely,"" said Katherine. ""Nothing of that kind ever happens to me."" He leaned forward. ""Would you like it to?"" The question startled her, and she drew in her breath sharply. ""It is my fancy, perhaps,"" said the little man, as he dexterously polished one of the forks, ""but I think that you have a yearning in you for interesting happenings. _Eh bien_, Mademoiselle, all through my life I have observed one thing--'All one wants one gets!' Who knows?"" His face screwed itself up comically. ""You may get more than you bargain for."" ""Is that a prophecy?"" asked Katherine, smiling as she rose from the table. The little man shook his head. ""I never prophesy,"" he declared pompously. ""It is true that I have the habit of being always right--but I do not boast of it. Good-night, Mademoiselle, and may you sleep well."" Katherine went back along the train amused and entertained by her little neighbour. She passed the open door of her friend's compartment and saw the conductor making up the bed. The lady in the mink coat was standing looking out of the window. The second compartment, as Katherine saw through the communicating door, was empty, with rugs and bags heaped up on the seat. The maid was not there. Katherine found her own bed prepared, and since she was tired, she went to bed and switched","['sale', 'always', 'I', 'tell', 'now', 'eh', 'Mademoiselle', 'I', 'ask', 'student', 'human', 'nature', '--', 'Katherine', 'feel', 'amused', 'perhaps', 'give', 'one', 'illusion', 'live', 'exciting', 'life', 'suggest', 'he', 'nod', 'gravely', 'yes', 'something', 'of', 'course', 'one', 'know', 'thing', 'not', 'really', 'happen', 'Katherine', 'continue', 'interrupt', 'sharply', 'sometimes', 'Mademoiselle', 'sometimes', 'I', 'speak', '--', 'happen', 'she', 'throw', 'quick', 'interested', 'glance', 'some', 'day', 'know', 'might', 'thick', 'thing', 'go', 'it', 'chance', 'I', 'not', 'think', 'likely', 'say', 'Katherine', 'nothing', 'kind', 'ever', 'happen', 'he', 'lean', 'forward', 'would', 'like', 'the', 'question', 'startle', 'draw', 'breath', 'sharply', 'it', 'fancy', 'perhaps', 'say', 'little', 'man', 'dexterously', 'polish', 'one', 'fork', 'I', 'think', 'yearning', 'interesting', 'happening', 'eh', 'bien', 'Mademoiselle', 'life', 'I', 'observe', 'one', ""thing--'all"", 'one', 'want', 'one', 'get', 'who', 'know', 'his', 'face', 'screw', 'comically', 'you', 'may', 'get', 'bargain', 'be', 'prophecy', 'ask', 'Katherine', 'smile', 'rise', 'table', 'the', 'little', 'man', 'shake', 'head', 'I', 'never', 'prophesy', 'declare', 'pompously', 'it', 'true', 'I', 'habit', 'always', 'right', '--', 'I', 'boast', 'good', 'night', 'Mademoiselle', 'may', 'sleep', 'well', 'Katherine', 'go', 'back', 'along', 'train', 'amuse', 'entertain', 'little', 'neighbour', 'she', 'pass', 'open', 'door', 'friend', ""'s"", 'compartment', 'see', 'conductor', 'make', 'bed', 'the', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'stand', 'look', 'window', 'the', 'second', 'compartment', 'Katherine', 'see', 'communicating', 'door', 'empty', 'rug', 'bag', 'heap', 'seat', 'the', 'maid', 'Katherine', 'find', 'bed', 'prepare', 'since', 'tired', 'go', 'bed', 'switch']"

Glancing at her watch, she found that it had stopped. A feeling of intense uneasiness pervaded her and grew stronger moment by moment. At last she got up, threw her dressing-gown round her shoulders, and stepped out into the corridor. The whole train seemed wrapped in slumber. Katherine let down the window and sat by it for some minutes, drinking in the cool night air and trying vainly to calm her uneasy fears. She presently decided that she would go along to the end and ask the conductor for the right time so that she could set her watch. She found, however, that his little chair was vacant. She hesitated for a moment and then walked through into the next coach. She looked down the long, dim line of the corridor and saw, to her surprise, that a man was standing with his hand on the door of the compartment occupied by the lady in the mink coat. That is to say, she thought it was the compartment. Probably, however, she was mistaken. He stood there for a moment or two with his back to her, seeming uncertain and hesitating in his attitude. Then he slowly turned, and with an odd feeling of fatality, Katherine recognized him as the same man whom she had noticed twice before--once in the corridor of the Savoy hotel and once in Cook's offices. Then he opened the door of the compartment and passed in, drawing it to behind him. An idea flashed across Katherine's mind. Could this be the man of whom the other woman had spoken--the man she was journeying to meet. Then Katherine told herself that she was romancing. In all probability she had mistaken the compartment. She went back to her own carriage. Five minutes later the train slackened speed. There was the long plaintive hiss of the Westinghouse brake, and a few minutes later the train came to a stop at Lyons.","['light', 'half', 'past', 'nine', 'she', 'wake', 'sudden', 'start', 'much', 'time', 'pass', 'know', 'glance', 'watch', 'find', 'stop', 'a', 'feeling', 'intense', 'uneasiness', 'pervade', 'grow', 'strong', 'moment', 'moment', 'at', 'last', 'get', 'throw', 'dressing', 'gown', 'round', 'shoulder', 'step', 'corridor', 'the', 'whole', 'train', 'seem', 'wrap', 'slumber', 'Katherine', 'let', 'window', 'sit', 'minute', 'drink', 'cool', 'night', 'air', 'try', 'vainly', 'calm', 'uneasy', 'fear', 'she', 'presently', 'decide', 'would', 'go', 'along', 'end', 'ask', 'conductor', 'right', 'time', 'could', 'set', 'watch', 'she', 'find', 'however', 'little', 'chair', 'vacant', 'she', 'hesitate', 'moment', 'walk', 'next', 'coach', 'she', 'look', 'long', 'dim', 'line', 'corridor', 'see', 'surprise', 'man', 'stand', 'hand', 'door', 'compartment', 'occupy', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'that', 'say', 'think', 'compartment', 'probably', 'however', 'mistaken', 'he', 'stand', 'moment', 'two', 'back', 'seem', 'uncertain', 'hesitate', 'attitude', 'then', 'slowly', 'turn', 'odd', 'feeling', 'fatality', 'Katherine', 'recognize', 'man', 'notice', 'twice', '--', 'corridor', 'Savoy', 'hotel', 'Cook', ""'s"", 'office', 'then', 'open', 'door', 'compartment', 'pass', 'draw', 'behind', 'an', 'idea', 'flash', 'across', 'Katherine', ""'s"", 'mind', 'could', 'man', 'woman', 'speak', '--', 'man', 'journey', 'meet', 'then', 'Katherine', 'tell', 'romance', 'in', 'probability', 'mistake', 'compartment', 'she', 'go', 'back', 'carriage', 'five', 'minute', 'later', 'train', 'slacken', 'speed', 'there', 'long', 'plaintive', 'hiss', 'Westinghouse', 'brake', 'minute', 'later', 'train', 'come', 'stop', 'Lyons']"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,1,"Katherine wakened the next morning to brilliant sunshine. She went along to breakfast early, but met none of her acquaintances of the day before. When she returned to her compartment it had just been restored to its day-time appearance by the conductor, a dark man with a drooping moustache and melancholy face. ""Madame is fortunate,"" he said; ""the sun shines. It is always a great disappointment to passengers when they arrive on a grey morning."" ""I should have been disappointed, certainly,"" said Katherine. The man prepared to depart. ""We are rather late, Madame,"" he said. ""I will let you know just before we get to Nice."" Katherine nodded. She sat by the window, entranced by the sunlit panorama. The palm trees, the deep blue of the sea, the bright yellow mimosa came with all the charm of novelty to the woman who for fourteen years had known only the drab winters of England. When they arrived at Cannes, Katherine got out and walked up and down the platform. She was curious about the lady in the mink coat, and looked up at the windows of her compartment. The blinds were still drawn down--the only ones to be so on the whole train. Katherine wondered a little, and when she re-entered the train she passed along the corridor and noticed that these two compartments were still shuttered and closed. The lady of the mink coat was clearly no early riser. Presently the conductor came to her and told her that in a few minutes the train would arrive at Nice. Katherine handed him a tip; the man thanked her, but still lingered. There was something odd about him. Katherine, who had at first wondered whether the tip had not been big enough, was now convinced that something far more serious was amiss. His face was of a sickly pallor, he was shaking all over, and looked as if he had been frightened out of his life. He was eyeing her in a curious manner. Presently he said abruptly:","['Katherine', 'waken', 'next', 'morning', 'brilliant', 'sunshine', 'she', 'go', 'along', 'breakfast', 'early', 'meet', 'none', 'acquaintance', 'day', 'when', 'return', 'compartment', 'restore', 'day', 'time', 'appearance', 'conductor', 'dark', 'man', 'droop', 'moustache', 'melancholy', 'face', 'Madame', 'fortunate', 'say', 'sun', 'shine', 'it', 'always', 'great', 'disappointment', 'passenger', 'arrive', 'grey', 'morning', 'I', 'disappoint', 'certainly', 'say', 'Katherine', 'the', 'man', 'prepare', 'depart', 'we', 'rather', 'late', 'Madame', 'say', 'I', 'let', 'know', 'get', 'Nice', 'Katherine', 'nod', 'she', 'sit', 'window', 'entrance', 'sunlit', 'panorama', 'the', 'palm', 'tree', 'deep', 'blue', 'sea', 'bright', 'yellow', 'mimosa', 'come', 'charm', 'novelty', 'woman', 'fourteen', 'year', 'know', 'drab', 'winter', 'England', 'when', 'arrive', 'Cannes', 'Katherine', 'get', 'walk', 'platform', 'she', 'curious', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'look', 'window', 'compartment', 'the', 'blind', 'still', 'draw', '--', 'one', 'whole', 'train', 'Katherine', 'wonder', 'little', 'enter', 'train', 'pass', 'along', 'corridor', 'notice', 'two', 'compartment', 'still', 'shutter', 'close', 'the', 'lady', 'mink', 'coat', 'clearly', 'early', 'riser', 'presently', 'conductor', 'come', 'tell', 'minute', 'train', 'would', 'arrive', 'Nice', 'Katherine', 'hand', 'tip', 'man', 'thank', 'still', 'linger', 'there', 'something', 'odd', 'Katherine', 'first', 'wonder', 'whether', 'tip', 'big', 'enough', 'convince', 'something', 'far', 'serious', 'amiss', 'his', 'face', 'sickly', 'pallor', 'shake', 'look', 'frighten', 'life', 'he', 'eye', 'curious', 'manner', 'presently', 'say', 'abruptly']"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,2,"""Madame will excuse me, but is she expecting friends to meet her at Nice?"" ""Probably,"" said Katherine. ""Why?"" But the man merely shook his head and murmured something that Katherine could not catch and moved away, not reappearing until the train came to rest at the station, when he started handing her belongings down from the window. Katherine stood for a moment or two on the platform rather at a loss, but a fair young man with an ingenuous face came up to her and said rather hesitatingly: ""Miss Grey, is it not?"" Katherine said that it was, and the young man beamed upon her seraphically and murmured: ""I am Chubby, you know--Lady Tamplin's husband. I expect she mentioned me, but perhaps she forgot. Have you got your _billet de bagages_? I lost mine when I came out this year, and you would not believe the fuss they made about it. Regular French red tape!"" Katherine produced it, and was just about to move off beside him when a very gentle and insidious voice murmured in her ear: ""A little moment, Madame, if you please."" Katherine turned to behold an individual who made up for insignificance of stature by a large quantity of gold lace and uniform. The individual explained. ""There were certain formalities. Madame would perhaps be so kind as to accompany him. The regulations of the police--"" He threw up his arms. ""Absurd, doubtless, but there it was."" Mr. Chubby Evans listened with a very imperfect comprehension, his French being of a limited order. ""So like the French,"" murmured Mr. Evans. He was one of those staunch patriotic Britons who, having made a portion of a foreign country their own, strongly resent the original inhabitants of it. ""Always up to some silly dodge or other. They've never tackled people on the station before, though. This is something quite new. I suppose you'll have to go."" Katherine departed with her guide.

He invited her to mount into this, and, preceding her down the corridor, held aside the door of one of the compartments. In it was a pompous-looking official personage, and with him a nondescript being who appeared to be a clerk. The pompous-looking personage rose politely, bowed to Katherine, and said: ""You will excuse me, Madame, but there are certain formalities to be complied with. Madame speaks French, I trust?"" ""Sufficiently, I think, Monsieur,"" replied Katherine in that language. ""That is good. Pray be seated, Madame. I am M. Caux, the Commissary of Police."" He blew out his chest importantly, and Katherine tried to look sufficiently impressed. ""You wish to see my passport?"" she inquired. ""Here it is."" The Commissary eyed her keenly and gave a little grunt. ""Thank you, Madame,"" he said, taking the passport from her. He cleared his throat. ""But what I really desire is a little information."" ""Information?"" The Commissary nodded his head slowly. ""About a lady who has been a fellow-passenger of yours. You lunched with her yesterday."" ""I am afraid I can't tell you anything about her. We fell into conversation over our meal, but she is a complete stranger to me. I have never seen her before."" ""And yet,"" said the Commissary sharply, ""you returned to her compartment with her after lunch and sat talking for some time?"" ""Yes,"" said Katherine; ""that is true."" The Commissary seemed to expect her to say something more. He looked at her encouragingly. ""Yes, Madame?"" ""Well, Monsieur?"" said Katherine. ""You can, perhaps, give me some kind of idea of that conversation?"" ""I could,"" said Katherine, ""but at the moment I see no reason to do so."" In somewhat British fashion she felt annoyed. This foreign official seemed to her impertinent. ""No reason?"" cried the Commissary. ""Oh yes, Madame, I can assure you that there _is_ a reason."" ""Then perhaps you will give it to me.""

""So you see, Madame, why we are anxious for any information we can possibly get."" ""But surely her maid--"" ""The maid has disappeared."" ""Oh!"" Katherine paused to assemble her thoughts. ""Since the conductor had seen you talking with her in her compartment, he quite naturally reported the fact to the police, and that is why, Madame, we have detained you, in the hope of gaining some information.""

""Yes,"" said Katherine thoughtfully. ""I suppose I did."" ""And that impression was--"" ""Yes, Mademoiselle""--the Commissary jerked himself forward--""let us by all means have your impressions."" Katherine sat turning the whole thing over in her mind. She felt in a way as if she were betraying a confidence, but with that ugly word ""Murder"" ringing in her ears she dared not keep anything back. Too much might hang upon it. So, as nearly as she could, she repeated word for word the conversation she had had with the dead woman. ""That is interesting,"" said the Commissary, glancing at the other. ""Eh, M. Poirot, that is interesting? Whether it has anything to do with the crime--"" He left the sentence unfinished. ""I suppose it could not be suicide,"" said Katherine, rather doubtfully. ""No,"" said the Commissary, ""it could not be suicide. She was strangled with a length of black cord."" ""Oh!"" Katherine shivered. M. Caux spread out his hands apologetically. ""It is not nice--no. I think that our train robbers are more brutal than they are in your country."" ""It is horrible."" ""Yes, yes""--he was soothing and apologetic--""but you have great courage, Mademoiselle.

""Must I?"" asked Katherine in a low voice. ""Some one must identify her,"" said the Commissary, ""and since the maid has disappeared""--he coughed significantly--""you appear to be the person who has seen most of her since she joined the train.""

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,6,"""Mademoiselle is sensible,"" he said. ""May I accompany you, M. Caux?"" ""Enchanted, my dear M. Poirot."" They went out into the corridor, and M. Caux unlocked the door of the dead woman's compartment. The blinds on the far side had been drawn half-way up to admit light. The dead woman lay on the berth to their left, in so natural a posture that one could have thought her asleep. The bedclothes were drawn up over her, and her head was turned to the wall, so that only the red auburn curls showed. Very gently M. Caux laid a hand on her shoulder and turned the body back so that the face came into view. Katherine flinched a little and dug her nails into her palms. A heavy blow had disfigured the features almost beyond recognition. Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. ""When was that done, I wonder?"" he demanded. ""Before death or after?"" ""The doctor says after,"" said M. Caux. ""Strange,"" said Poirot, drawing his brows together. He turned to Katherine. ""Be brave, Mademoiselle; look at her well. Are you sure that this is the woman you talked to in the train yesterday?"" Katherine had good nerves. She steeled herself to look long and earnestly at the recumbent figure. Then she leaned forward and took up the dead woman's hand. ""I am quite sure,"" she replied at length. ""The face is too disfigured to recognize, but the build and carriage and hair are exact, and besides I noticed _this_""--she pointed to a tiny mole on the dead woman's wrist--""while I was talking to her."" ""_Bon_,"" approved Poirot. ""You are an excellent witness, Mademoiselle. There is, then, no question as to the identity, but it is strange, all the same."" He frowned down on the dead woman in perplexity. M. Caux shrugged his shoulders. ""The murderer was carried away by rage, doubtless,"" he suggested. ""If she had been struck down, it would have been comprehensible,"" mused Poirot, ""but the man who strangled her slipped up behind and caught her","['Mademoiselle', 'sensible', 'say', 'may', 'I', 'accompany', 'M.', 'Caux', 'enchant', 'dear', 'M.', 'Poirot', 'they', 'go', 'corridor', 'M.', 'Caux', 'unlock', 'door', 'dead', 'woman', ""'s"", 'compartment', 'the', 'blind', 'far', 'side', 'draw', 'half', 'way', 'admit', 'light', 'the', 'dead', 'woman', 'lie', 'berth', 'left', 'natural', 'posture', 'one', 'could', 'think', 'asleep', 'the', 'bedclothe', 'draw', 'head', 'turn', 'wall', 'red', 'auburn', 'curl', 'show', 'very', 'gently', 'M.', 'Caux', 'lay', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'turn', 'body', 'back', 'face', 'come', 'view', 'Katherine', 'flinch', 'little', 'dig', 'nail', 'palm', 'a', 'heavy', 'blow', 'disfigure', 'feature', 'almost', 'beyond', 'recognition', 'Poirot', 'give', 'sharp', 'exclamation', 'when', 'do', 'I', 'wonder', 'demand', 'before', 'death', 'the', 'doctor', 'say', 'say', 'M.', 'Caux', 'strange', 'say', 'Poirot', 'draw', 'brow', 'together', 'he', 'turn', 'Katherine', 'be', 'brave', 'Mademoiselle', 'look', 'well', 'be', 'sure', 'woman', 'talk', 'train', 'yesterday', 'Katherine', 'good', 'nerve', 'she', 'steel', 'look', 'long', 'earnestly', 'recumbent', 'figure', 'then', 'lean', 'forward', 'take', 'dead', 'woman', ""'s"", 'hand', 'I', 'quite', 'sure', 'reply', 'length', 'the', 'face', 'disfigured', 'recognize', 'build', 'carriage', 'hair', 'exact', 'besides', 'I', 'notice', 'this_""--she', 'point', 'tiny', 'mole', 'dead', 'woman', ""'s"", 'wrist--""while', 'I', 'talk', 'bon', 'approve', 'Poirot', 'you', 'excellent', 'witness', 'Mademoiselle', 'there', 'question', 'identity', 'strange', 'he', 'frown', 'dead', 'woman', 'perplexity', 'M.', 'Caux', 'shrug', 'shoulder', 'the', 'murderer', 'carry', 'away', 'rage', 'doubtless', 'suggest', 'if', 'strike', 'would', 'comprehensible', 'muse', 'Poirot', 'man', 'strangle', 'slip', 'behind', 'catch']"

Did he hope that if the face were unrecognizable she might not be identified? Or did he hate her so much that he could not resist striking that blow even after she was dead?"" Katherine shuddered, and he turned at once to her kindly. ""You must not let me distress you, Mademoiselle,"" he said. ""To you this is all very new and terrible. To me, alas! it is an old story. One moment, I pray of you both."" They stood against the door watching him as he went quickly round the compartment. He noted the dead woman's clothes neatly folded on the end of the berth, the big fur coat that hung from a hook, and the little red lacquer hat tossed up on the rack. Then he passed through into the adjoining compartment, that in which Katherine had seen the maid sitting. Here the berth had not been made up. Three or four rugs were piled loosely on the seat; there was a hat-box and a couple of suit-cases. He turned suddenly to Katherine. ""You were in here yesterday,"" he said. ""Do you see anything changed, anything missing?"" Katherine looked carefully round both compartments. ""Yes,"" she said, ""there is something missing--a scarlet morocco case. It had the initials 'R. V. K.' on it. It might have been a small dressing-case or a big jewel-case. When I saw it, the maid was holding it."" ""Ah!"" said Poirot. ""But, surely,"" said Katherine. ""I--of course, I don't know anything about such things, but surely it is plain enough, if the maid and the jewel-case are missing?"" ""You mean that it was the maid who was the thief? No, Mademoiselle; there is a very good reason against that."" ""What?"" ""The maid was left behind in Paris."" He turned to Poirot.

""No,"" said the Commissary, who clearly did object very much. ""No, certainly, M. Poirot, if you say so. You have finished here?"" ""I think so. One little minute."" He had been turning over the rugs, and now he took one to the window and looked at it, picking something off it with his fingers. ""What is it?"" demanded M. Caux sharply. ""Four auburn hairs."" He bent over the dead woman. ""Yes, they are from the head of Madame."" ""And what of it? Do you attach importance to them?"" Poirot let the rug drop back on the seat. ""What is important? What is not? One cannot say at this stage. But we must note each little fact carefully.""

""Very good, Monsieur le Commissaire. It was after we had left the Gare de Lyon.

She said to me that she had been obliged to leave her maid behind in Paris, so that I need make up only one berth. She took her dinner basket into the adjoining compartment, and sat there while I made up the bed; then she told me that she did not wish to be wakened early in the morning, that she liked to sleep on. I told her I quite understood, and she wished me 'good-night.'"" ""You yourself did not go into the adjoining compartment?"" ""No, Monsieur.""

The other, and the more likely to my mind, is that her assailant was a train robber travelling on the train; that he stole along the corridor unseen by the conductor, killed her, and went off with the red morocco case, which doubtless contained jewels of some value. In all probability he left the train at Lyons, and we have already telegraphed to the station there for full particulars of any one seen leaving the train."" ""Or he might have come on to Nice,"" suggested Poirot. ""He might,"" agreed the Commissary, ""but that would be a very bold course."" Poirot let a minute or two go by before speaking, and then he said: ""In the latter case you think the man was an ordinary train robber?"" The Commissary shrugged his shoulders. ""It depends. We must get hold of the maid. It is possible that she has the red morocco case with her.

Strange that it should have been so, and that a brutal crime should have been the ending of that fateful journey. But suddenly Katherine remembered a small fact that she ought, perhaps, to have told the police--a fact that had for the moment escaped her memory. Was it of any real importance? She had certainly thought that she had seen a man going into that particular compartment, but she realized that she might easily have been mistaken. It might have been the compartment next door, and certainly the man in question could be no train robber. She recalled him very clearly as she had seen him on those two previous occasions--once at the Savoy and once at Cook's office. No, doubtless she had been mistaken.

Most of Lady Tamplin's guests had arrived, and since noise was the essential of Lady Tamplin's parties, the din was already terrific. Chubby rushed up to Katherine, pressed a cocktail upon her, and took her under his wing. ""Oh, here you are, Derek,"" cried Lady Tamplin, as the door opened to admit the last comer. ""Now at last we can have something to eat. I am starving."" Katherine looked across the room. She was startled. So this--was Derek, and she realized that she was not surprised.

The man was no better than a common swindler."" ""You are quite right,"" said the Commissary. ""The Comte de la Roche is well known to us. If it were possible, we should have laid him by the heels before now, but _ma foi!_ it is not easy; the fellow is cunning, his affairs are always conducted with ladies of high social position. If he obtains money from them under false pretences or as the fruit of blackmail, _eh bien!_ naturally they will not prosecute. To look foolish in the eyes of the world, oh no, that would never do, and he has an extraordinary power over women."" ""That is so,"" said the millionaire heavily.

Wiping his fine black moustache delicately with his table napkin, the Comte rose from the table. He passed through the salon of the villa, noting with appreciation the few _objets d'art_ which were carelessly scattered about. The Louis XV snuff-box, the satin shoe worn by Marie Antoinette, and the other historic trifles were part of the Comte's _mise en scène_. They were, he would explain to his fair visitors, heirlooms in his family. Passing through on to the terrace, the Comte looked out on the Mediterranean with an unseeing eye. He was in no mood for appreciating the beauties of scenery. A fully matured scheme had been rudely brought to naught, and his plans had to be cast afresh. Stretching himself out in a basket chair, a cigarette held between his white fingers, the Comte pondered deeply. Presently Hippolyte, his man-servant, brought out coffee and a choice of liqueurs. The Comte selected some very fine old brandy. As the man-servant was preparing to depart, the Comte arrested him with a slight gesture. Hippolyte stood respectfully to attention.

""That is well,"" said the Comte drily; ""nevertheless they will come--I am sure of it. They will ask questions."" Hippolyte looked at his master in intelligent anticipation. The Comte spoke slowly, without looking at Hippolyte. ""As you know, I arrived here last Tuesday morning. If the police or any other inquirer should question you, do not forget that fact.

Occasionally he frowned, once he shook his head slightly, twice he nodded it. Into the midst of these cogitations came Hippolyte once more. ""A lady, Monsieur."" ""A lady?"" The Comte was surprised. Not that a visit from a lady was an unusual thing at the Villa Marina, but at this particular moment the Comte could not think who the lady was likely to be. ""She is, I think, a lady not known to Monsieur,"" murmured the valet helpfully. The Comte was more and more intrigued. ""Show her out here, Hippolyte,"" he commanded. A moment later a marvellous vision in orange and black stepped out on the terrace, accompanied by a strong perfume of exotic blossoms. ""Monsieur le Comte de la Roche?"" ""At your service, Mademoiselle,"" said the Comte, bowing. ""My name is Mirelle. You may have heard of me."" ""Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle, but who has not been enchanted by the dancing of Mademoiselle Mirelle? Exquisite!"" The dancer acknowledged this compliment with a brief mechanical smile.

True, his experience had not lain much in ladies of Mirelle's class, who were themselves predatory. He and the dancer were, in a sense, birds of a feather. His arts, the Comte knew, would be thrown away on Mirelle. She was a Parisienne, and a shrewd one. Nevertheless, there was one thing that the Comte could recognize infallibly when he saw it. He knew at once that he was in the presence of a very angry woman, and an angry woman, as the Comte was well aware, always says more than is prudent, and is occasionally a source of profit to a level-headed gentleman who keeps cool. ""It is most amiable of you, Mademoiselle, to honour my poor abode thus."" ""We have mutual friends in Paris,"" said Mirelle. ""I have heard of you from them, but I come to see you to-day for another reason. I have heard of you since I came to Nice--in a different way, you understand."" ""Ah?"" said the Comte softly.

""It amuses people to talk,"" murmured the Comte indifferently. ""It would be beneath me to take such wild accusations seriously."" ""You do not understand."" Mirelle bent forward, her dark eyes flashing. ""It is not the idle talk of those in the streets. It is the police."" ""The police--ah?"" The Comte sat up, alert once more. Mirelle nodded her head vigorously several times. ""Yes, yes. You comprehend me--I have friends every where.

The Comte leant back in his chair. His face was a mask. ""Let me ask you, Mademoiselle--how do you know this?"" ""How do I know it?"" Mirelle sprang to her feet, with a laugh. ""He boasted of it beforehand. He was ruined, bankrupt, dishonoured. Only the death of his wife could save him. He told me so. He travelled on the same train--but she was not to know it.

""But surely, Mademoiselle, in that case he would not steal the jewels?"" ""The jewels!"" breathed Mirelle. ""The jewels. Ah! Those rubies...."" Her eyes grew misty, a far-away light in them. The Comte looked at her curiously, wondering for the hundredth time at the magical influence of precious stones on the female sex. He recalled her to practical matters.

Mirelle laughed softly, and drew her orange-and-black wrap closer round her. ""Send them to me, Monsieur le Comte,"" she said softly; ""I will give them the proof they want."" Upon that she was gone, an impetuous whirlwind, her errand accomplished. The Comte looked after her, his eyebrows delicately raised. ""She is in a fury,"" he murmured. ""What has happened now to upset her? But she shows her hand too plainly. Does she really believe that Mr. Kettering killed his wife? She would like me to believe it. She would even like the police to believe it."" He smiled to himself. He had no intention whatsoever of going to the police. He saw various other possibilities, to judge by his smile, an agreeable vista of them. Presently, however, his brow clouded. According to Mirelle, he was suspected by the police.

He went into the house and questioned Hippolyte closely once more as to whether any strangers had been to the house. The valet was positive in his assurances that this was not the case. The Comte went up to his bedroom and crossed over to an old bureau that stood against the wall. He let down the lid of this, and his delicate fingers sought for a spring at the back of one of the pigeon-holes. A secret drawer flew out; in it was a small brown paper package. The Comte took this out and weighed it in his hand carefully for a minute or two. Raising his hand to his head, with a slight grimace he pulled out a single hair. This he placed on the lip of the drawer and shut it carefully. Still carrying the small parcel in his hand, he went downstairs and out of the house to the garage, where stood a scarlet two-seater car. Ten minutes later he had taken the road for Monte Carlo. He spent a few hours at the Casino, then sauntered out into the town. Presently he re-entered the car and drove off in the direction of Mentone.

The little red car had been specially built to the Comte's design, and had a far more powerful engine than would have been suspected from its appearance. It shot ahead. Presently he looked back and smiled; the grey car was following behind. Smothered in dust, the little red car leaped along the road. It was travelling now at a dangerous pace, but the Comte was a first-class driver. Now they were going down hill, twisting and curving unceasingly. Presently the car slackened speed, and finally came to a standstill before a Bureau de Poste. The Comte jumped out, lifted the lid of the tool chest, extracted the small brown paper parcel and hurried into the post office. Two minutes later he was driving once more in the direction of Mentone. When the grey car arrived there, the Comte was drinking English five o'clock tea on the terrace of one of the hotels.

He paid little compliments. ""It is amazing, M. Kettering, how well you speak the French,"" he observed--""so well that you could be taken for a Frenchman if you chose.

""Me, I approve of that young man,"" said Poirot, sending a beaming smile after the departing secretary; ""and you, Mademoiselle?"" ""I like him very much."" ""And you, M. Kettering?"" Some quick rejoinder was springing to Derek's lips, but he checked it as though something in the little Belgian's twinkling eyes had made him suddenly alert. He spoke carefully, choosing his words. ""Knighton is a very good fellow,"" he said. Just for a moment Katherine fancied that Poirot looked disappointed. ""He is a great admirer of yours, M. Poirot,"" she said, and she related some of the things that Knighton had said. It amused her to see the little man plume himself like a bird, thrusting out his chest, and assuming an air of mock modesty that would have deceived no one. ""That reminds me, Mademoiselle,"" he said suddenly, ""I have a little matter of business I have to speak to you about. When you were sitting talking to that poor lady in the train, I think you must have dropped a cigarette case."" Katherine looked rather astonished. ""I don't think so,"" she said. Poirot drew from his pocket a cigarette case of soft blue leather, with the initial ""K"" on it in gold. ""No, that is not mine,"" Katherine said. ""Ah, a thousand apologies.

""You made a mistake, Miss Grey,"" he said easily.

It says that 'it is well to be off with the old love, before being on with the new.'"" Kettering turned on him angrily. ""What the devil do you mean?""

A soft colour rose in her cheeks as a tall fair man with a limp came hurrying along the path towards them--Major Knighton. There was relief and an unexpected warmth in her voice as she greeted him. Derek stood up scowling, his face black as a thundercloud. ""Lady Tamplin having a flutter?"" he said easily. ""I must join her and give her the benefit of my system."" He swung round on his heel and left them together. Katherine sat down again. Her heart was beating rapidly and unevenly, but as she sat there talking commonplaces to the quiet, rather shy man beside her, her self-command came back. Then she realized with a shock that Knighton also was laying bare his heart, much as Derek had done, but in a very different manner. He was shy and stammering. The words came haltingly with no eloquence to back them.

She felt that she was no longer sitting alone on the seat in the Casino gardens, but that some one was standing beside her, and that that some one was the dead woman, Ruth Kettering. She had a further impression that Ruth wanted--badly--to tell her something. The impression was so curious, so vivid, that it could not be driven away.

As Knighton joined him, the number thirty-three turned up, and Poirot's stake was swept away. ""Bad luck!"" said Knighton; ""are you going to stake again?"" Poirot shook his head. ""Not at present."" ""Do you feel the fascination of gambling?"" asked Knighton curiously. ""Not at roulette."" Knighton shot a swift glance at him. His own face became troubled. He spoke haltingly, with a touch of deference. ""I wonder, are you busy, M. Poirot? There is something I would like to ask you about."" ""I am at your disposal. Shall we go outside? It is pleasant in the sunshine."" They strolled out together, and Knighton drew a deep breath. ""I love the Riviera,"" he said.

""How long ago the War seems now!"" mused Knighton. They walked on in silence for some little way. ""You have something on your mind?"" said Poirot. Knighton looked at him in some surprise. ""You are quite right,"" he confessed. ""I don't know how you knew it, though."" ""It showed itself only too plainly,"" said Poirot drily. ""I did not know that I was so transparent.""

This she did in much the same words as she had done to Knighton and Poirot, though with far more soberness of manner. ""This is an extraordinary story, Mademoiselle,"" said M. Carrège slowly. He leant back in his chair, adjusted his pince-nez, and looked keenly and searchingly at the dancer through them. ""You wish us to believe M. Kettering actually boasted of the crime to you beforehand?"" ""Yes, yes. She was too healthy, he said. If she were to die it must be an accident--he would arrange it all."" ""You are aware, Mademoiselle,"" said M. Carrège sternly, ""that you are making yourself out to be an accessory before the fact?"" ""Me? But not the least in the world, Monsieur. Not for a moment did I take that statement seriously. Ah no, indeed! I know men, Monsieur; they say many wild things. It would be an odd state of affairs if one were to take all they said _au pied de la lettre_."" The Examining Magistrate raised his eyebrows. ""We are to take it, then, that you regarded M. Kettering's threats as mere idle words? May I ask, Mademoiselle, what made you throw up your engagements in London and come out to the Riviera?"" Mirelle looked at him with melting black eyes. ""I wished to be with the man I loved,"" she said simply. ""Was it so unnatural?"" Poirot interpolated a question gently. ""Was it, then, at M. Kettering's wish that you accompanied him to Nice?""

""In such matters I please myself, Monsieur,"" she said. That the answer was not an answer at all was noted by all three men. They said nothing. ""When were you first convinced that M. Kettering had murdered his wife?"" ""As I tell you, Monsieur, I saw M. Kettering come out of his wife's compartment just before the train drew into Lyons. There was a look on his face--ah! at the moment I could not understand it--a look haunted and terrible. I shall never forget it."" Her voice rose shrilly, and she flung out her arms in an extravagant gesture. ""Quite so,"" said M. Carrège. ""Afterwards, when I found that Madame Kettering was dead when the train left Lyons, then--then I knew!"" ""And still--you did not go to the police, Mademoiselle,"" said the Commissary mildly. Mirelle glanced at him superbly; she was clearly enjoying herself in the rôle she was playing. ""Shall I betray my lover?"" she asked. ""Ah no; do not ask a woman to do that."" ""Yet now--"" hinted M. Caux. ""Now it is different. He has betrayed me! Shall I suffer that in silence...?"" The Examining Magistrate checked her. ""Quite so, quite so,"" he murmured soothingly. ""And now, Mademoiselle, perhaps you will read over the statement of what you have told us, see that it is correct, and sign it."" Mirelle wasted no time on the document. ""Yes, yes,"" she said, ""it is correct."" She rose to her feet. ""You require me no longer, Messieurs?"" ""At present, no, Mademoiselle."" ""And Dereek will be arrested?"" ""At once, Mademoiselle."" Mirelle laughed cruelly and drew her fur draperies closer about her. ""He should have thought of this before he insulted me,"" she cried.

I--"" She came to an abrupt stop. Poirot was regarding her intently, and he saw the wary look that came into her eyes. ""I have been told so. Everybody says so."" ""Oh,"" said Poirot, ""I was not aware that the fact had been mentioned outside the Examining Magistrate's office."" Mirelle appeared somewhat discomposed. ""One hears those things,"" she said vaguely; ""they get about. Somebody told me. I can't remember who it was."" She moved to the door. M. Caux sprang forward to open it for her, and as he did so, Poirot's voice rose gently once more. ""And the jewels? Pardon, Mademoiselle. Can you tell me anything about those?"" ""The jewels? What jewels?"" ""The rubies of Catherine the Great. Since you hear so much, you must have heard of them."" ""I know nothing about any jewels,"" said Mirelle sharply. She went out, closing the door behind her. M. Caux came back to his chair; the Examining Magistrate sighed. ""What a fury!"" he said, ""but _diablement chic_, I wonder if she is telling the truth? I think so."" ""There is _some_ truth in her story, certainly,"" said Poirot. ""We have confirmation of it from Miss Grey.

""The case against him seems quite clear,"" said the Commissary, sighing; ""it is a thousand pities,"" he murmured. ""How do you mean?"" asked Poirot.

Taking a paper-cutter from his pocket, he slit it open. It was a long telegram, and he read it over twice before slowly putting it in his pocket. Upstairs, George was awaiting his master. ""I am fatigued, Georges, much fatigued. Will you order for me a small pot of chocolate?"" The chocolate was duly ordered and brought, and George set it at the little table at his master's elbow. As he was preparing to retire, Poirot spoke: ""I believe, Georges, that you have a good knowledge of the English aristocracy?"" murmured Poirot. George smiled apologetically. ""I think that I might say that I have, sir,"" he replied. ""I suppose that it is your opinion, Georges, that criminals are invariably drawn from the lower orders."" ""Not always, sir. There was great trouble with one of the Duke of Devize's younger sons. He left Eton under a cloud, and after that he caused great anxiety on several occasions.

He remained in thought for a few moments and then said: ""You rang up Mademoiselle Papopolous?"" ""Yes, sir; she and her father will be pleased to dine with you to-night.""

The car took him, not straight to Monte Carlo, but to Lady Tamplin's house at Cap Martin, where he asked for Miss Grey. The ladies were dressing and Poirot was shown into a small salon to wait, and here, after a lapse of three or four minutes, Lenox Tamplin came to him. ""Katherine is not quite ready yet,"" she said. ""Can I give her a message, or would you rather wait until she comes down?"" Poirot looked at her thoughtfully. He was a minute or two in replying, as though something of great weight hung upon his decision. Apparently the answer to such a simple question mattered. ""No,"" he said at last, ""no, I do not think it is necessary that I should wait to see Mademoiselle Katherine. I think, perhaps, that it is better that I should not. These things are sometimes difficult."" Lenox waited politely, her eyebrows slightly raised. ""I have a piece of news,"" continued Poirot. ""You will, perhaps, tell your friend. M.

Again she was silent, frowning. Poirot said gently: ""You have known Derek Kettering a long time, have you not?"" ""Off and on ever since I was a kid,"" said Lenox gruffly.

""He came into two million."" ""And if she had not died he would have been ruined?"" ""Yes."" ""But there must have been more than that,"" persisted Lenox.

""The doctors' evidence necessarily cannot be very definite,"" said Poirot; ""they are inclined to think that death was unlikely to have occurred after leaving Lyons. And we know this much, that a few moments after leaving Lyons Mrs. Kettering was dead."" ""How do you know that?"" Poirot was smiling rather oddly to himself. ""Some one else went into her compartment and found her dead."" ""And they did not rouse the train?"" ""No."" ""Why was that?"" ""Doubtless they had their reasons."" Lenox looked at him sharply. ""Do you know the reason?"" ""I think so--yes."" Lenox sat still turning things over in her mind. Poirot watched her in silence. At last she looked up. A soft colour had come into her cheeks and her eyes were shining. ""You think some one on the train must have killed her, but that need not be so at all. What is to stop any one swinging themselves on to the train when it stopped at Lyons? They could go straight to her compartment, strangle her, and take the rubies and drop off the train again without any one being the wiser. She may have been actually killed while the train was in Lyons station. Then she would have been alive when Derek went in, and dead when the other person found her."" Poirot leant back in his chair. He drew a deep breath. He looked across at the girl and nodded his head three times, then he heaved a sigh. ""Mademoiselle,"" he said, ""what you have said there is very just--very true.

""You are meeting some one?"" ""Yes."" ""Some one who knows something?"" ""Some one who might know something. In these matters one must leave no stone unturned. Au revoir, Mademoiselle.""

When the car had driven off he relapsed into a frowning absorption, but in his eyes was that faint green light which was always the precursor of the triumph to be. He was a few minutes late at the rendezvous, and found that M. Papopolous and his daughter had arrived before him. His apologies were abject, and he outdid himself in politeness and small attentions. The Greek was looking particularly benign and noble this evening, a sorrowful patriarch of blameless life. Zia was looking handsome and good humoured. The dinner was a pleasant one. Poirot was his best and most sparkling self. He told anecdotes, he made jokes, he paid graceful compliments to Zia Papopolous, and he told many interesting incidents of his career. The menu was a carefully selected one, and the wine was excellent. At the close of dinner M. Papopolous inquired politely: ""And the tip I gave you? You have had your little flutter on the horse?""

""No,"" said Poirot; ""it is what our friends, the English, call a dark horse."" ""Ah!"" said M. Papopolous thoughtfully. ""Now we must step across to the Casino and have our little flutter at the roulette table,"" cried Poirot gaily. At the Casino the party separated, Poirot devoting himself solely to Zia, whilst Papopolous himself drifted away. Poirot was not fortunate, but Zia had a run of good luck, and had soon won a few thousand francs. ""It would be as well,"" she observed drily to Poirot, ""if I stopped now."" Poirot's eyes twinkled. ""Superb!"" he exclaimed. ""You are the daughter of your father, Mademoiselle Zia. To know when to stop. Ah! that is the art."" He looked round the rooms. ""I cannot see your father anywhere about,"" he remarked carelessly. ""I will fetch your cloak for you, Mademoiselle, and we will go out in the gardens."" He did not, however, go straight to the cloak-room. His sharp eyes had seen but a little while before the departure of M. Papopolous. He was anxious to know what had become of the wily Greek. He ran him to earth unexpectedly in the big entrance hall. He was standing by one of the pillars, talking to a lady who had just arrived. The lady was Mirelle. Poirot sidled unostentatiously round the room. He arrived at the other side of the pillar, and unnoticed by the two who were talking together in an animated fashion--or rather, that is to say, the dancer was talking, Papopolous contributing an occasional monosyllable and a good many expressive gestures.

""Only a very little while,"" pleaded the other. ""Ah! but you must! A week--ten days--that is all I ask. You can be sure of your affair. The money will be forthcoming."" Papopolous shifted a little and looked round him uneasily--to find Poirot almost at his elbow with a beaming innocent face. ""_Ah! vous voilà_, M. Papopolous. I have been looking for you. It is permitted that I take Mademoiselle Zia for a little turn in the gardens? Good evening, Mademoiselle."" He bowed very low to Mirelle. ""A thousand pardons that I did not see you immediately."" The dancer accepted his greetings rather impatiently. She was clearly annoyed at the interruption of her _tête-à-tête_. Poirot was quick to take the hint. Papopolous had already murmured: ""Certainly--but certainly,"" and Poirot withdrew forthwith. He fetched Zia's cloak, and together they strolled out into the gardens. ""This is where the suicides take place,"" said Zia. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""So it is said. Men are foolish, are they not, Mademoiselle? To eat, to drink, to breathe the good air, it is a very pleasant thing, Mademoiselle. One is foolish to leave all that simply because one has no money--or because the heart aches. _L'amour_, it causes many fatalities, does it not?"" Zia laughed.

A Letter From Home,1,"""_Dear Katherine--Living among grand friends as you are doing now, I don't suppose you will care to hear any of our news; but as I always thought you were a sensible girl, perhaps you are a trifle less swollen-headed than I suppose. Everything goes on much the same here. There was great trouble about the new curate, who is scandalously high. In my view, he is neither more nor less than a Roman. Everybody has spoken to the Vicar about it, but you know what the Vicar is--all Christian charity and no proper spirit. I have had a lot of trouble with maids lately. That girl Annie was no good--skirts up to her knees and wouldn't wear sensible woollen stockings. Not one of them can bear being spoken to. I have had a lot of pain with my rheumatism one way and another, and Dr. Harris persuaded me to go and see a London specialist--a waste of three guineas and a railway fare, as I told him; but by waiting until Wednesday I managed to get a cheap return. The London doctor pulled a long face and talked all round about and never straight out, until I said to him, 'I'm a plain woman, Doctor, and I like things to be plainly stated. Is it cancer, or is it not?' And then, of course, he had to say it was. They say a year with care, and not too much pain, though I am sure I can bear pain as well as any other Christian woman. Life seems rather lonely at times, with most of my friends dead or gone before.

However, if things should go ill with you--and that is always possible. I have heard no end of tales of bogus noblemen marrying girls and getting hold of their money and then leaving them at the church door. I dare say you are too sensible for anything of the kind to happen to you, but one never knows; and never having had much attention of any kind it might easily go to your head now.

She felt a curious lump in her throat. A sudden wave of longing for St. Mary Mead swept over her. So full of familiar, everyday, stupid little things--and yet--home. She felt very inclined to lay her head down on her arms and indulge in a real good cry.

""Nothing,"" said Katherine, grabbing up Miss Viner's letter and thrusting it into her handbag. ""You looked rather queer,"" said Lenox. ""I say--I hope you don't mind--I rang up your detective friend, M. Poirot, and asked him to lunch with us in Nice. I said you wanted to see him, as I thought he might not come for me."" ""Did you want to see him then?"" asked Katherine. ""Yes,"" said Lenox. ""I have rather lost my heart to him. I never met a man before whose eyes were really green like a cat's."" ""All right,"" said Katherine. She spoke listlessly. The last few days had been trying. Derek Kettering's arrest had been the topic of the hour, and the Blue Train Mystery had been thrashed out from every conceivable standpoint. ""I have ordered the car,"" said Lenox, ""and I have told Mother some lie or other--unfortunately I can't remember exactly what; but it won't matter, as she never remembers. If she knew where we were going, she would want to come too, to pump M. Poirot."" The two girls arrived at the Negresco to find Poirot waiting. He was full of Gallic politeness, and showered so many compliments upon the two girls that they were soon helpless with laughter; yet for all that the meal was not a gay one. Katherine was dreamy and distracted, and Lenox made bursts of conversation, interspersed by silences. As they were sitting on the terrace sipping their coffee she suddenly attacked Poirot bluntly.

""You are young, Mademoiselle, but there are three things that cannot be hurried--_le bon Dieu_, Nature, and old people."" ""Nonsense!"" said Lenox. ""You are not old."" ""Ah, it is pretty what you say there."" ""Here is Major Knighton,"" said Lenox. Katherine looked round quickly and then turned back again. ""He is with Mr. Van Aldin,"" continued Lenox. ""There is something I want to ask Major Knighton about. I won't be a minute."" Left alone together, Poirot bent forward and murmured to Katherine: ""You are _distraite_, Mademoiselle; your thoughts, they are far away, are they not?"" ""Just as far as England, no farther."" Guided by a sudden impulse, she took the letter she had received that morning and handed it across to him to read. ""That is the first word that has come to me from my old life; somehow or other--it hurts."" He read it through and then handed it back to her. ""So you are going back to St. Mary Mead?"" he said slowly. ""No, I am not,"" said Katherine; ""why should I?"" ""Ah,"" said Poirot, ""it is my mistake. You will excuse me one little minute."" He strolled across to where Lenox Tamplin was talking to Van Aldin and Knighton. The American looked old and haggard. He greeted Poirot with a curt nod but without any other sign of animation. As he turned to reply to some observation made by Lenox, Poirot drew Knighton aside. ""M. Van Aldin looks ill,"" he said. ""Do you wonder?"" asked Knighton.

""I wish,"" he murmured, ""that you could tell Miss Grey that."" ""Tell her what?"" ""That you--I mean that M. Van Aldin is returning to England."" Knighton looked a little puzzled, but he readily crossed the terrace and joined Katherine. Poirot saw him go with a satisfied nod of the head, and then joined Lenox and the American. After a minute or two they joined the others. Conversation was general for a few minutes, then the millionaire and his secretary departed. Poirot also prepared to take his departure. ""A thousand thanks for your hospitality, Mesdemoiselles,"" he cried; ""it has been a most charming luncheon. _Ma foi_, I needed it!"" He swelled out his chest and thumped it.

The Comte de la Roche himself had gone to Monte Carlo for the day. Chancing to look out of the window, Hippolyte espied a visitor walking briskly up to the hall door, a visitor of so uncommon a type that Hippolyte, experienced as he was, had some difficulty in placing him. Calling to his wife, Marie, who was busy in the kitchen, he drew her attention to what he called _ce type là_. ""It is not the police again?"" said Marie anxiously. ""Look for yourself,"" said Hippolyte. Marie looked. ""Certainly not the police,"" she declared. ""I am glad."" ""They have not really worried us much,"" said Hippolyte. ""In fact, but for Monsieur le Comte's warning, I should never have guessed that stranger at the wine-shop to be what he was.""

Facing him was a relieved but very puzzled man. Poirot leant back in his chair, lit one of his tiny cigarettes, and stared reflectively at the ceiling. ""Yes, I will give you explanations. It began with the one point that puzzled me. You know what that point was? _The disfigured face._ It is not an uncommon thing to find when investigating a crime and it rouses an immediate question, the question of identity. That naturally was the first thing that occurred to me. Was the dead woman really Mrs. Kettering? But that line led me nowhere, for Miss Grey's evidence was positive and very reliable, so I put that idea aside. The dead woman _was_ Ruth Kettering."" ""When did you first begin to suspect the maid?"" ""Not for some time, but one peculiar little point drew my attention to her. The cigarette case found in the railway carriage and which she told us was one which Mrs. Kettering had given to her husband. Now that was, on the face of it, most improbable, seeing the terms that they were on. It awakened a doubt in my mind as to the general veracity of Ada Mason's statements. There was the rather suspicious fact to be taken into consideration, that she had only been with her mistress for two months. Certainly it did not seem as if she could have had anything to do with the crime since she had been left behind in Paris and Mrs. Kettering had been seen alive by several people afterwards, but--"" Poirot leant forward.

8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,2,"I am told. I say to myself: how do we know that Ada Mason was left behind in Paris? And at first the answer to that question seemed completely satisfactory. There was the evidence of your secretary, Major Knighton, a complete outsider whose testimony might be supposed to be entirely impartial, and there was the dead woman's own words to the conductor on the train. But I put the latter point aside for the moment, because a very curious idea--an idea perhaps fantastic and impossible--was growing up in my mind. If by any outside chance it happened to be true, that particular piece of testimony was worthless. ""I concentrated on the chief stumbling-block to my theory, Major Knighton's statement that he saw Ada Mason at the Ritz after the Blue Train had left Paris. That seemed conclusive enough, but yet, on examining the facts carefully, I noted two things. First, that by a curious coincidence he, too, had been exactly two months in your service. Secondly, his initial letter was the same--'K.' Supposing--just supposing--that it was _his_ cigarette case which had been found in the carriage. Then, if Ada Mason and he were working together, and she recognized it when we showed it to her, would she not act precisely as she had done? At first, taken aback, she quickly evolved a plausible theory that would agree with Mr. Kettering's guilt. _Bien entendu_, that was not the original idea. The Comte de la Roche was to be the scapegoat, though Ada Mason would not make her recognition of him too certain, in case he should be able to prove an alibi. Now, if you will cast your mind back to that time, you will remember a significant thing that happened. I suggested to Ada Mason that the man she had seen was not the Comte de la Roche, but Derek Kettering.

""No, no, Monsieur Van Aldin; not impossible. _Les femmes_, they look so much alike nowadays that one identifies them more by their clothing than by their faces. Ada Mason was the same height as your daughter. Dressed in that very sumptuous fur coat and the little red lacquer hat jammed down over her eyes, with just a bunch of auburn curls showing over each ear, it was no wonder that the conductor was deceived. He had not previously spoken to Mrs. Kettering, you remember. True, he had seen the maid just for a moment when she handed him the tickets, but his impression had been merely that of a gaunt, black-clad female. If he had been an unusually intelligent man, he might have gone so far as to say that mistress and maid were not unlike, but it is extremely unlikely that he would even think that. And remember, Ada Mason, or Kitty Kidd, was an actress, able to change her appearance and tone of voice at a moment's notice. No, no; there was no danger of his recognizing the maid in the mistress's clothing, but there _was_ the danger that when he came to discover the body he might realize it was not the woman he had talked to the night before.

""But who killed Ruth--and when?"" ""First, bear it in mind that the crime was planned and undertaken by the two of them--Knighton and Ada Mason, working together. Knighton was in Paris that day on your business. He boarded the train somewhere on its way round the _ceinture_. Mrs. Kettering would be surprised, but she would be quite unsuspicious. Perhaps he draws her attention to something out the window, and as she turns to look he slips the cord round her neck--and the whole thing is over in a second or two. The door of the compartment is locked, and he and Ada Mason set to work. They strip off the dead woman's outer clothes. Mason and Knighton roll the body up in a rug and put it on the seat in the adjoining compartment amongst the bags and suit-cases. Knighton drops off the train, taking the jewel-case containing the rubies with him. Since the crime is not supposed to have been committed until nearly twelve hours later he is perfectly safe, and his evidence and the supposed Mrs. Kettering's words to the conductor will provide a perfect alibi for his accomplice. ""At the Gare de Lyon Ada Mason gets a dinner basket, and shutting herself into the toilet compartment she quickly changes into her mistress's clothes, adjusts two false bunches of auburn curls, and generally makes up to resemble her as closely as possible. When the conductor comes to make up the bed, she tells him the prepared story about having left her maid behind in Paris; and whilst he is making up the berth, she stands looking out of the window, so that her back is towards the corridor and people passing along there.

""Before getting to Lyons, Ada Mason arranged her mistress's body in the bunk, folded up the dead woman's clothes neatly on the end of it, and herself changed into a man's clothes and prepared to leave the train. When Derek Kettering entered his wife's compartment, and, as he thought, saw her asleep in her berth, the scene had been set, and Ada Mason was hidden in the next compartment waiting for the moment to leave the train unobserved. As soon as the conductor had swung himself down on to the platform at Lyons, she follows, slouching along as though just taking a breath of air. At a moment when she is unobserved, she hurriedly crosses to the other platform, and takes the first train back to Paris and the Ritz Hotel. Her name has been registered there as taking a room the night before by one of Knighton's female accomplices. She has nothing to do but wait there placidly for your arrival. The jewels are not, and never have been, in her possession. No suspicion attaches to him, and, as your secretary, he brings them to Nice without the least fear of discovery. Their delivery there to Monsieur Papopolous is already arranged for and they are entrusted to Mason at the last moment to hand over to the Greek. Altogether a very neatly planned coup, as one would expect from a master of the game such as the Marquis.""

""Yes, yes; that was part of the game. As Richard Knighton his life was quite free from reproach. He was well born, well connected, did honourable service in the War, and seemed altogether above suspicion; but when I came to glean information about the mysterious Marquis, I found many points of similarity. Knighton spoke French like a Frenchman, he had been in America, France, and England at much the same time as the Marquis was operating. The Marquis was last heard of as engineering various jewel robberies in Switzerland, and it was in Switzerland that you had come across Major Knighton; and it was at precisely that time that the first rumours were going round of your being in treaty for the famous rubies.""

This plan was, so he thought, completely safe. No possible suspicion could attach to Richard Knighton. But like all great men--and the Marquis was a great man--he had his weaknesses. He fell genuinely in love with Miss Grey, and suspecting her liking for Derek Kettering, he could not resist the temptation to saddle him with the crime when the opportunity presented itself. And now, Monsieur Van Aldin, I am going to tell you something very curious. Miss Grey is not a fanciful woman by any means, yet she firmly believes that she felt your daughter's presence beside her one day in the Casino Gardens at Monte Carlo, just after she had been having a long talk with Knighton. She was convinced, she says, that the dead woman was urgently trying to tell her something, and it suddenly came to her that what the dead woman was trying to say was that Knighton was her murderer! The idea seemed so fantastic at the time that Miss Grey spoke of it to no one. But she was so convinced of its truth that she acted on it--wild as it seemed. She did not discourage Knighton's advances, and she pretended to him that she was convinced of Derek Kettering's guilt."" ""Extraordinary,"" said Van Aldin. ""Yes, it is very strange.

When I was in London I went to the surgeon in question, and I got several technical details from him which confirmed me in that belief. I mentioned the name of that surgeon in Knighton's hearing the day before yesterday. The natural thing would have been for Knighton to mention that he had been attended by him during the War, but he said nothing--and that little point, if nothing else, gave me the last final assurance that my theory of the crime was correct. Miss Grey, too, provided me with a cutting, showing that there had been a robbery at Lady Tamplin's hospital during the time that Knighton had been there.
