2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,1,"It was about three o’clock when we arrived at the little station of Elmer’s Dale. From there a five-mile drive brought us to a small gray stone building in the midst of the rugged moors. “A lonely place,” I observed. Havering nodded. “I shall try and get rid of it. I could never live here again.” We unlatched the gate and were walking up"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,2,"the narrow path to the oak door when a familiar figure emerged and came to meet us. “Japp!” I ejaculated. The Scotland Yard Inspector grinned at me in a friendly fashion before addressing my companion. “Mr. Havering, I think? I’ve been sent down from London to take charge of this case, and I’d like a word with you, if I may, sir.” “My wife——”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,3,"“I’ve seen your good lady, sir—and the housekeeper. I wont keep you a moment, but I’m anxious to get back to the village now that I’ve seen all there is to see here.” “I know nothing as yet as to what—” “Ex-actly,” said Japp soothingly. “But there are just one or two little points I’d like your opinion about all the same. Captain Hastings,"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,4,"here, he knows me, and he’ll go on up to the house and tell them you’re coming.” I went on to the house. I rang the bell, as Japp had closed the door behind him. After some moments it was opened to me by a middle-aged woman in black. “Mr. Havering will be here in a moment,” I explained. “He has been detained by"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,5,"the Inspector. I have come down with him from London to look into the case. Perhaps you can tell me briefly what occurred last night?” “Come inside, sir.” She closed the door behind me, and we stood in the dimly lighted hall. “It was after dinner last night, sir, that the man came. He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and seeing that he"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,6,"spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s, and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give no name, which of course was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. “I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled, like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,7,"me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarreling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,8,"silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked, and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.” “What became of the man?” “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.” “And then?” “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,9,"miles to walk, it was. They came back with me; and the constable, he stayed all night; and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.” “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?” The housekeeper reflected. “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,1,*       *       *       *       *,10,"American, I didn’t notice much about him.” “I see. Now, I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?” “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?” “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.” “Very good, sir.”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,1,"I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels. Mrs. Havering did not keep me"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,2,"waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming toward me. She wore a flame-colored jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,3,"dark head was a little hat of flame-colored leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality. I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension. “Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, M. Poirot."
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,4,"You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now, will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,5,"this dreadful affair?” “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now, what time was it that this man arrived?” “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.” “Your husband had already left for London?”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,6,"“Yes, he went up by the six-fifteen.” “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?” “Our own car isn’t down here. One came out from the garage in Elmer’s Dale to fetch him in time for the train.”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,7,"“Was Mr. Pace quite his usual self?” “Absolutely—most normal in every way.” “Now, can you describe this visitor at all?” “I’m afraid not. I didn’t see him. Mrs. Middleton showed him straight into the gun-room and then came to tell my uncle.”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,8,"“What did your uncle say?” “He seemed rather annoyed, but went off at once. It was about five minutes later that I heard the sound of raised voices. I ran out into the hall, and almost collided with Mrs. Middleton. Then we"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,9,"heard the shot. The gun-room door was locked on the inside, and we had to go round the house to the window. Of course that took some time, and the murderer had been able to get well away. My poor uncle”—her voice"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,2,*       *       *       *       *,10,"faltered—“had been shot through the head. I saw at once that he was dead, and I sent Mrs. Middleton for the police straight away. I was careful to touch nothing in the room but to leave it exactly as I found it.”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,1,"I nodded approval. “Now, as to the weapon?” “Well, I can make a guess at it, Captain Hastings. A pair of revolvers of my husband’s were mounted"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,2,"upon the wall. One of them is missing. I pointed this out to the police, and they took the other one away with them. When they have"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,3,"extracted the bullet, I suppose they will know for certain.” “May I go to the gun-room?” “Certainly. The police have finished with it. But the body"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,4,"has been removed.” She accompanied me to the scene of the crime. At that moment Havering entered the hall, and with a quick apology, his wife"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,5,"ran to him. I was left to undertake my investigations alone. I may as well confess at once that they were rather disappointing. In detective-novels, clues"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,6,"abound, but here I could find nothing that struck me as out of the ordinary except a large bloodstain on the carpet where I judged the"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,7,"dead man had fallen. I examined everything with painstaking care and took a couple of pictures of the room with my little camera, which I had"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,8,"brought with me. I also examined the ground outside the window, but it appeared to have been so heavily trampled that I judged it was useless"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,9,to waste time over it. Now I had seen all that Hunter’s Lodge had to show me. I must go back to Elmer’s Dale and get
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,3,*       *       *       *       *,10,"into touch with Japp. Accordingly I took leave of the Haverings, and was driven off in the car that had brought us up from the station."
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,1,"Japp I found at the Matlock Arms, and he took me forthwith to see the body. Harrington Pace was a small, spare, cleanshaven man, typically American in appearance. He had been shot through the back of the"

2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,3,"fully loaded, and I suppose the other one was also. Curious what darn fool things people do. Fancy keeping two loaded revolvers hanging up on your wall!” “What do you think of the case?” I asked as"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,4,"we left the gruesome chamber behind us. “Well, I’d got my eye on Havering to begin with.... Oh, yes,”—noting my exclamation of astonishment,—“Havering has one or two shady incidents in his past. When he was a boy"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,5,"at Oxford, there was some funny business about the signature on one of his father’s checks. All hushed up, of course. Then he’s pretty heavily in debt now, and they’re the kind of debts he wouldn’t like"

2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,7,"saw his wife; but their statements dovetail all right, and I’ve been to the station, and there’s no doubt whatever that he left by the six-fifteen. That gets up to London about ten-thirty. He went straight to"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,8,"his club, he says, and if that’s confirmed all right—why, he couldn’t have been shooting his uncle here at nine o’clock in a black beard!” “Ah, yes—I was going to ask you what you thought about"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,9,"that beard?” Japp winked. “I think it grew pretty fast—grew in the five miles from Elmer’s Dale to Hunter’s Lodge. Americans that I’ve met are mostly clean shaven. I questioned the housekeeper first, and then her"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,4,*       *       *       *       *,10,"mistress, and their stories agree all right; but I’m sorry Mrs. Havering didn’t get a look at the fellow. She’s a smart woman, and she might have noticed something that would set us on the track.”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,1,I sat down and wrote a minute and lengthy account to Poirot. I was able to add various further items of information before I posted the letter. The bullet had been extracted and was proved to have been fired from a revolver identical
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,2,"in size to the one held by the police. Furthermore, Mr. Havering’s movements on the night in question had been checked and verified, and it was proved beyond doubt that he had actually arrived in London by the train in question. And thirdly,"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,3,"a sensational development had occurred. A city gentleman, living at Ealing, on crossing Haven Green to get to the District Railway station that morning, had observed a brown paper parcel stuck between the railings. Opening it, he found that it contained a revolver."
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,4,"He handed the parcel over to the local police station, and before night it was proved to be the one we were in search of, the fellow to that given us by Mrs. Havering. One bullet had been fired from it. All this"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,5,I added to my report. A wire from Poirot arrived while I was at breakfast the following morning: Of course black-bearded man was not Havering. Only you or Japp would have such an idea. Wire me description of housekeeper and what clothes she
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,6,wore this morning. Same of Mrs. Havering. Do not waste time taking photographs of interiors. They are underexposed and not in the least artistic. It seemed to me that Poirot’s style was unnecessarily facetious. I also fancied he was a shade jealous of
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,7,"my position on the spot, with full facilities for handling the case. His request for a description of the clothes worn by the two women appeared to me to be simply ridiculous, but I complied as well as I, a mere man, was"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,8,"able to. At eleven a reply wire came from Poirot: Advise Japp arrest housekeeper before it is too late. Dumfounded, I took the wire to Japp. He swore softly under his breath. “He’s the goods, M. Poirot! If he says so, there’s something"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,9,"in it. And I hardly noticed the woman! I don’t know that I can go so far as arresting her, but I’ll have her watched. We’ll go up right away and take another look at her.” But it was too late. Mrs. Middleton,"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,5,*       *       *       *       *,10,"that quiet, middle-aged woman, who had appeared so normal and respectable, had vanished into thin air. Her box had been left behind. It contained only ordinary wearing apparel. There was no clue in it to her identity, or as to her whereabouts."
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,1,"From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could. “I engaged her about three weeks ago, when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left. She came to me from Mrs. Selboume’s Agency in Mount St.—a very well-known place. I get all my servants from there. They sent several women to see me, but this Mrs. Middleton seemed much the nicest, and had splendid references. I engaged her on the spot, and notified the Agency of the fact. I can’t believe that there was anything wrong with her. She was such a nice, quiet woman.” The thing was certainly a mystery. While it was clear that the woman herself could not have committed the crime, since at the moment the"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,2,"shot was fired Mrs. Havering was with her in the hall, nevertheless she must have some connection with the murder, or why should she suddenly take to her heels and bolt? I wired the latest development to Poirot, and suggested returning to London and making inquiries at Selbourne’s Agency. Poirot’s reply was prompt: Useless to inquire at Agency. They will never have heard of her. Find out what vehicle took her up to Hunter’s Lodge when she first arrived there. Though mystified, I was obedient. The means of transport in Elmer’s Dale were limited. The local garage had two cars, and there were two station flies. None of these had been requisitioned on the date in question. I may"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,3,"also mention that inquiries at the Agency in London bore out Poirot’s prognostication. No such woman as “Mrs. Middleton” had ever been on their books. They had received the Hon. Mrs. Havering’s application for a housekeeper, and had sent her various applicants for the post. When she sent them the engagement fee, she omitted to mention which woman she had selected. [It is suggested that the reader pause in his perusal of the story at this point, make his own solution of the mystery—and then see how close he comes to that of the author—The Editors.] Somewhat crestfallen, I returned to London. I found Poirot established in an armchair by the fire. He greeted me with much affection. “_Mon"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,4,"ami Hastings!_ But how glad I am to see you! Veritably I have for you a great affection! And you have enjoyed yourself? You have run to and fro with the good Japp? You have interrogated and investigated to your heart’s content?” “Poirot,” I cried, “the thing’s a dark mystery! It will never be solved.” “It is true that we are not likely to cover ourselves with glory over it.” “No, indeed. It’s a hard nut to crack.” “Oh, as far as that goes, me, I am very good at cracking the nuts! A veritable squirrel! It is not that which embarrasses me. I know well enough who killed Mr. Harrington Pace.” “You know? How did you find out?”"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,5,"“Your illuminating answers to my wires supplied me with the truth..... See here, Hastings, let us examine the facts methodically and in order. Mr. Harrington Pace is a man with a considerable fortune which at his death will doubtless pass to his nephew—point number one. His nephew is known to be desperately hard up—point number two. His nephew is also known to be—shall we say a man of loose moral fiber? Point number three!” “But Roger Havering is proved to have journeyed straight up to London.” “_Précisément!_ And therefore, as Mr. Havering left Elmer’s Dale at six-fifteen, and since Mr. Pace cannot have been killed before he left (or the doctor would have spotted the time of the crime"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,6,"as being given wrongly when he examined the body), we conclude, quite rightly, that Mr. Havering did _not_ shoot his uncle. But there is a Mrs. Havering, Hastings.” “Impossible! The housekeeper was with her when the shot was fired.” “Ah, yes, the housekeeper. But she has disappeared.” “She will be found.” “I think not. There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper—don’t you think so? It struck me at once.” “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.” “And what was her part?” “Well—I presume to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.” “Oh, no, that was not her part. Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,7,"Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, _mon ami_, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.” “It was Dickens,” I murmured, smiling. “But what do you mean, Poirot?” “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim, middle-aged figure in black with a faint, subdued voice, and finally that neither you, nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was a child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On"

A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed; a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice.” “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?” “No, that was Roger Havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once; he would not carry it up"
2,The Hunter's Lodge Case,6,*       *       *       *       *,9,"to London with him. No, the motive was clear; the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire; they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course, the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the District Railway, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature his wife, quietly shoots Mr."

She reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.” “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated. “And yet—” “And yet it is true. _Bien sûr_, my friend, it is true! But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can—I have written him fully; but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate—or _le bon Dieu_—whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him. “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, _croyez moi_!”"

3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,1,"Nadina, the Russian dancer who had taken Paris by storm, swayed to the sound of the applause, bowed and bowed again. Her narrow black eyes narrowed themselves still more, the long line of her scarlet mouth curved faintly upwards. Enthusiastic Frenchmen continued to beat the ground appreciatively as the curtain fell with a swish, hiding the reds and blues and magentas of the bizarre _décors._ In a swirl of blue and orange draperies the dancer left the stage. A bearded gentleman received her enthusiastically in his arms. It was the Manager. “Magnificent, _petite,_ magnificent,” he cried. “To-night you have surpassed yourself.” He kissed her gallantly on both cheeks in a somewhat matter-of-fact manner. Madame Nadina accepted the tribute with the ease of long habit and passed on to her dressing-room, where bouquets were heaped carelessly everywhere, marvellous garments of futuristic design hung on pegs, and the air was hot and sweet with the scent of the massed blossoms and with more sophisticated perfumes and essences. Jeanne,"

Jeanne went to answer it, and returned with a card in her hand. “Madame will receive?” “Let me see.” The dancer stretched out a languid hand, but at the sight of the name on the card, “Count Sergius Paulovitch,” a sudden flicker of interest came into her eyes. “I will see him. The maize _peignoir,_ Jeanne, and quickly. And when the Count comes you may go.” _“Bien, Madame.”_ Jeanne brought the _peignoir,_ an exquisite wisp of corn-coloured chiffon and ermine. Nadina slipped into it, and sat smiling to herself, whilst one long white hand beat a slow tattoo on the glass of the dressing-table. The Count was prompt to avail himself of the privilege accorded to him—a man of medium height, very slim, very elegant, very pale, extraordinarily weary. In feature, little to take hold of, a man difficult to recognize again"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,3,"if one left his mannerisms out of account. He bowed over the dancer’s hand with exaggerated courtliness. “Madame, this is a pleasure indeed.” So much Jeanne heard before she went out closing the door behind her. Alone with her visitor, a subtle change came over Nadina’s smile. “Compatriots though we are, we will not speak Russian, I think,” she observed. “Since we neither of us know a word of the language, it might be as well,” agreed her guest. By common consent, they dropped into English, and nobody, now that the Count’s mannerisms had dropped from him, could doubt that it was his native language. He had, indeed, started life as a quick-change music-hall artiste in London. “You had a great success to-night,” he remarked. “I congratulate you.” “All the same,” said the woman, “I am disturbed. My position is not what it was. The suspicions aroused during the War have never died down. I am continually watched and spied upon.” “But no charge of espionage"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,4,"was ever brought against you?” “Our chief lays his plans too carefully for that.” “Long life to the ‘Colonel,’” said the Count, smiling. “Amazing news, is it not, that he means to retire? To retire! Just like a doctor, or a butcher, or a plumber——” “Or any other business man,” finished Nadina. “It should not surprise us. That is what the ‘Colonel’ has always been—an excellent man of business. He has organized crime as another man might organize a boot factory. Without committing himself, he has planned and directed a series of stupendous _coups,_ embracing every branch of what we might call his ‘profession.’ Jewel robberies, forgery, espionage (the latter very profitable in war-time), sabotage, discreet assassination, there is hardly anything he has not touched. Wisest of all, he knows when to stop. The game begins to be dangerous?—he retires gracefully—with an enormous fortune!” “H’m!” said the Count doubtfully. “It is rather—upsetting for all of us. We are at a loose end, as it were.” “But"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,5,"we are being paid off—on a most generous scale!” Something, some undercurrent of mockery in her tone, made the man look at her sharply. She was smiling to herself, and the quality of her smile aroused his curiosity. But he proceeded diplomatically: “Yes, the ‘Colonel’ has always been a generous paymaster. I attribute much of his success to that—and to his invariable plan of providing a suitable scapegoat. A great brain, undoubtedly a great brain! And an apostle of the maxim, ‘If you want a thing done safely, do not do it yourself!’ Here are we, every one of us incriminated up to the hilt and absolutely in his power, and not one of us has anything on him.” He paused, almost as though he were expecting her to disagree with him, but she remained silent, smiling to herself as before. “Not one of us,” he mused. “Still, you know, he is superstitious, the old man. Years ago, I believe, he went to one of these"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,6,"fortune-telling people. She prophesied a lifetime of success, but declared that his downfall would be brought about through a woman.” He had interested her now. She looked up eagerly. “That is strange, very strange! Through a woman, you say?” He smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “Doubtless, now that he has—retired, he will marry. Some young society beauty, who will disperse his millions faster than he acquired them.” Nadina shook her head. “No, no, that is not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London.” “But your contract here?” “I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have left France. And why do you think that I go?” “Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?” “Exactly.” She rose and stood in front of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. “You said just now that none"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,7,"of us had anything on the chief. You were wrong. I have. I, a woman, have had the wit and, yes, the courage—for it needs courage—to double-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamonds?” “Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war broke out? I had nothing to do with it, and I never heard the details, the case was hushed up for some reason, was it not? A fine haul too.” “A hundred thousand pounds worth of stones. Two of us worked it—under the ‘Colonel’s’ orders, of course. And it was then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan was to substitute some of the De Beer diamonds for some sample diamonds brought from South America by two young prospectors who happened to be in Kimberley at the time. Suspicion was then bound to fall on them.” “Very clever,” interpolated the Count approvingly. “The ‘Colonel’ is always clever. Well, I did my part—but I also did one thing which the ‘Colonel’"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,8,"had not foreseen. I kept back some of the South American stones—one or two are unique and could easily be proved never to have passed through De Beer’s hands. With these diamonds in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteemed chief. Once the two young men are cleared, his part in the matter is bound to be suspected. I have said nothing all these years, I have been content to know that I had this weapon in reserve, but now matters are different. I want my price—and it will be a big, I might almost say a staggering price.” “Extraordinary,” said the Count. “And doubtless you carry these diamonds about with you everywhere?” His eyes roamed gently round the disordered room. Nadina laughed softly. “You need suppose nothing of the sort. I am not a fool. The diamonds are in a safe place where no one will dream of looking for them.” “I never thought you a fool, my dear lady, but may"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,9,"I venture to suggest that you are somewhat foolhardy? The ‘Colonel’ is not the type of man to take kindly to being blackmailed, you know.” “I am not afraid of him,” she laughed. “There is only one man I have ever feared—and he is dead.” The man looked at her curiously. “Let us hope that he will not come to life again, then,” he remarked lightly. “What do you mean?” cried the dancer sharply. The Count looked slightly surprised. “I only meant that a resurrection would be awkward for you,” he explained. “A foolish joke.” She gave a sigh of relief. “Oh, no, he is dead all right. Killed in the war. He was a man who once—loved me.” “In South Africa?” asked the Count negligently. “Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa.” “That is your native country, is it not?” She nodded. Her visitor rose and reached for his hat. “Well,” he remarked, “you know your own business best, but, if I were"
3,The Missing Will,1,PROLOGUE,10,"you, I should fear the ‘Colonel’ far more than any disillusioned lover. He is a man whom it is particularly easy to—underestimate.” She laughed scornfully. “As if I did not know him after all these years!” “I wonder if you do?” he said softly. “I very much wonder if you do.” “Oh, I am not a fool! And I am not alone in this. The South African mail-boat docks at Southampton to-morrow, and on board her is a man who has come specially from Africa at my request and who has carried out certain orders of mine. The ‘Colonel’ will have not one of us to deal with, but two.” “Is that wise?” “It is necessary.” “You are sure of this man?” A rather peculiar smile played over the dancer’s face. “I am quite sure of him. He is inefficient, but perfectly trustworthy.” She paused, and then added in an indifferent tone of voice: “As a matter of fact, he happens to be my husband.”"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,1,"Everybody has been at me, right and left, to write this story from the great (represented by Lord Nasby) to the small (represented by our late maid of all work, Emily, whom I saw when I was last in England. “Lor’, miss, what a beyewtiful book you might make out of it all—just like the pictures!”). I’ll admit that I’ve certain qualifications for the task. I was mixed up in the affair from the very beginning, I was in the thick of it all through, and I was triumphantly “in at the death.” Very fortunately, too, the gaps that I cannot supply from my own knowledge are amply covered by Sir Eustace Pedler’s diary, of which he has kindly begged me to make use. So here goes. Anne Beddingfeld starts to narrate her adventures. I’d always longed for adventures. You see, my life had such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, was one of England’s greatest living authorities on Primitive Man. He really was a genius—every one admits that. His"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,2,"mind dwelt in Palaeolithic times, and the inconvenience of life for him was that his body inhabited the modern world. Papa did not care for modern man—even Neolithic Man he despised as a mere herder of cattle, and he did not rise to enthusiasm until he reached the Mousterian period. Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One is forced to have some kind of truck with butchers and bakers and milkmen and greengrocers. Therefore, Papa being immersed in the past, Mamma having died when I was a baby, it fell to me to undertake the practical side of living. Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I typed and revised most of Papa’s _Neanderthal Man and his Ancestors,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathing, and I always reflect what a fortunate circumstance it was that they became extinct in remote ages. I do not know whether Papa guessed my feelings on the subject, probably not, and in any case he"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,3,"would not have been interested. The opinion of other people never interested him in the slightest degree. I think it was really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he lived quite detached from the necessities of daily life. He ate what was put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seemed mildly pained when the question of paying for it arose. We never seemed to have any money. His celebrity was not of the kind that brought in a cash return. Although he was a fellow of almost every important society, and had rows of letters after his name, the general public scarcely knew of his existence, and his long learned books, though adding signally to the sum-total of human knowledge, had no attraction for the masses. Only on one occasion did he leap into the public gaze. He had read a paper before some society on the subject of the young of the chimpanzee. The young of the human race show some anthropoid features, whereas the young"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,4,"of the chimpanzee approach more nearly to the human than the adult chimpanzee does. That seems to show that whereas our ancestors were more Simian than we are, the chimpanzee’s were of a higher type than the present species—in other words, the chimpanzee is a degenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ being hard up for something spicy, immediately brought itself out with large headlines. “We are not descended from monkeys, but are monkeys descended from _us?_ Eminent Professor says chimpanzees are decadent humans.” Shortly afterwards a reporter called to see Papa, and endeavoured to induce him to write a series of popular articles on the theory. I have seldom seen Papa so angry. He turned the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, as we were particularly short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditated running after the young man and informing him that my father had changed his mind and would send the articles in question. I could"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,5,"easily have written them myself, and the probabilities were that Papa would never have learnt of the transaction, not being a reader of the _Daily Budget._ However, I rejected this course as being too risky, so I merely put on my best hat and went sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer. The reporter from the _Daily Budget_ was the only young man who ever came to our house. There were times when I envied Emily, our little servant, who “walked out” whenever occasion offered with a large sailor to whom she was affianced. In between times, to “keep her hand in” as she expressed it, she walked out with the greengrocer’s young man, and the chemist’s assistant. I reflected sadly that I had no one to “keep my hand in” with. All Papa’s friends were aged Professors—usually with long beards. It is true that Professor Peterson once clasped me affectionately and said I had a “neat little waist” and then tried to kiss me. The phrase alone"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,6,"dated him hopelessly. No self-respecting female has had a “neat little waist” since I was in my cradle. I yearned for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seemed condemned to an existence of drab utility. The village possessed a lending library, full of tattered works of fiction, and I enjoyed perils and love-making at second hand, and went to sleep dreaming of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always “felled their opponent with a single blow.” There was no one in the village who even looked as though he could “fell” an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There was the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of “The Perils of Pamela.” Pamela was a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunted her. She fell out of aeroplanes, adventured in submarines, climbed skyscrapers and crept about in the Underworld without turning a hair. She was not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld caught her each time, but as he seemed loath to knock her on the"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,7,"head in a simple way, and always doomed her to death in a sewer-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous means, the hero was always able to rescue her at the beginning of the following week’s episode. I used to come out with my head in a delirious whirl—and then I would get home and find a notice from the Gas Company threatening to cut us off if the outstanding account was not paid! And yet, though I did not suspect it, every moment was bringing adventure nearer to me. It is possible that there are many people in the world who have never heard of the finding of an antique skull at the Broken Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I came down one morning to find Papa excited to the point of apoplexy. He poured out the whole story to me. “You understand, Anne? There are undoubtedly certain resemblances to the Java skull, but superficial—superficial only. No, here we have what I have always maintained—the ancestral form of"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,8,"the Neanderthal race. You grant that the Gibraltar skull is the most primitive of the Neanderthal skulls found? Why? The cradle of the race was in Africa. They passed to Europe——” “Not marmalade on kippers, papa,” I said hastily, arresting my parent’s absent-minded hand. “Yes, you were saying?” “They passed to Europe on——” Here he broke down with a bad fit of choking, the result of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bones. “But we must start at once,” he declared, as he rose to his feet at the conclusion of the meal. “There is no time to be lost. We must be on the spot—there are doubtless incalculable finds to be found in the neighbourhood. I shall be interested to note whether the implements are typical of the Mousterian period—there will be the remains of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be starting soon. We must get ahead of them. You will write to Cook’s to-day, Anne?” “What about"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,9,"money, papa?” I hinted delicately. He turned a reproachful eye upon me. “Your point of view always depresses me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid.” “I feel Cook’s might be sordid, papa.” Papa looked pained. “My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money.” “I haven’t got any ready money.” Papa looked thoroughly exasperated. “My child, I really cannot be bothered with these vulgar money details. The bank—I had something from the Manager yesterday, saying I had twenty-seven pounds.” “That’s your overdraft, I fancy.” “Ah, I have it! Write to my publishers.” I acquiesced doubtfully, Papa’s books bringing in more glory than money. I liked the idea of going to Rhodesia immensely. “Stern silent men,” I murmured to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent’s appearance struck me as unusual. “You have odd boots on, papa,” I said. “Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don’t forget your"
3,The Missing Will,2,CHAPTER I,10,"muffler. It’s a very cold day.” In a few minutes Papa stalked off, correctly booted and well mufflered. He returned late that evening, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat were missing. “Dear me, Anne, you are quite right. I took them off to go into the cavern. One gets so dirty there.” I nodded feelingly, remembering an occasion when Papa had returned literally plastered from head to foot with rich Pleiocene clay. Our principal reason for settling in Little Hampsly had been the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a buried cave rich in deposits of the Aurignacian culture. We had a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spent most of their days messing about underground and bringing to light portions of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa coughed badly all the evening, and the following morning I saw he had a temperature and sent for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never had a chance. It was double pneumonia. He died four days later."
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,1,"Every one was very kind to me. Dazed as I was, I appreciated that. I felt no overwhelming grief. Papa had never loved me, I knew that well enough. If he had, I might have loved him in return. No, there had not been love between us, but we had belonged together, and I had looked after him, and had secretly admired his learning and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have died just when the interest of life was at its height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have buried him in a cave, with paintings of reindeer and flint implements, but the force of public opinion constrained a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar’s consolations, though well meant, did not console me in the least. It took some time to dawn upon me that the thing I had always longed for—freedom—was at last mine. I was an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I realized the extraordinary kindness of all these good people."
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,2,"The vicar did his best to persuade me that his wife was in urgent need of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly made up its mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor called upon me, and after making various ridiculous excuses for failing to send in a proper bill, he hummed and hawed a good deal and suddenly suggested that I should marry him. I was very much astonished. The doctor was nearer forty than thirty, and a round, tubby little man. He was not at all like the hero of “The Perils of Pamela,” and even less like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflected a minute and then asked him why he wanted to marry me. That seemed to fluster him a good deal, and he murmured that a wife was a great help to a General Practitioner. The position seemed even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urged towards its acceptance. Safety, that was what I was being offered. Safety—and a Comfortable Home. Thinking it over now, I believe I did the little man an"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,3,"injustice. He was honestly in love with me, but a mistaken delicacy prevented him from pressing his suit on those lines. Anyway, my love of romance rebelled. “It’s extremely kind of you,” I said. “But it’s impossible. I could never marry a man unless I loved him madly.” “You don’t think——?” “No, I don’t,” I said firmly. He sighed. “But, my dear child, what do you propose to do?” “Have adventures and see the world,” I replied, without the least hesitation. “Miss Anne, you are very much of a child still. You don’t understand——” “The practical difficulties? Yes, I do, doctor. I’m not a sentimental schoolgirl—I’m a hard-headed mercenary shrew! You’d know it if you married me!” “I wish you would reconsider——” “I can’t.” He sighed again. “I have another proposal to make. An aunt of mine who lives in Wales is in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?” “No, doctor, I’m going to London. If things happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eyes open and you’ll see, something will turn up! You’ll"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,4,"hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo.” My next visitor was Mr. Flemming, Papa’s London solicitor. He came down specially from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he was a great admirer of Papa’s works. He was a tall, spare man with a thin face and grey hair. He rose to meet me as I entered the room and, taking both my hands in his, patted them affectionately. “My poor child,” he said. “My poor, poor child.” Without conscious hypocrisy, I found myself assuming the demeanour of a bereaved orphan. He hypnotized me into it. He was benignant, kind and fatherly—and without the least doubt he regarded me as a perfect fool of a girl left adrift to face an unkind world. From the first I felt that it was quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary. As things turned out, perhaps it was just as well I didn’t. “My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few things clear to you?” “Oh, yes.” “Your father, as you know,"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,5,"was a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he was not a good man of business.” I knew that quite as well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrained myself from saying so. He continued: “I do not suppose you understand much of these matters. I will try to explain as clearly as I can.” He explained at unnecessary length. The upshot seemed to be that I was left to face life with the sum of £87, 17s. 4d. It seemed a strangely unsatisfying amount. I waited in some trepidation for what was coming next. I feared that Mr. Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who was in want of a bright young companion. Apparently, however, he hadn’t. “The question is,” he went on, “the future. I understand you have no living relatives?” “I’m alone in the world,” I said, and was struck anew by my likeness to a film heroine. “You have friends?” “Every one has been very kind to me,” I said gratefully. “Who would not be kind to one so young and charming?”"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,6,"said Mr. Flemming gallantly. “Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be done.” He hesitated a minute, and then said: “Supposing—how would it be if you came to us for a time?” I jumped at the chance. London! The place for things to happen. “It’s awfully kind of you,” I said. “Might I really? Just while I’m looking round. I must start out to earn my living, you know?” “Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite understand. We will look round for something—suitable.” I felt instinctively that Mr. Flemming’s ideas of “something suitable” and mine were likely to be widely divergent, but it was certainly not the moment to air my views. “That is settled then. Why not return with me to-day?” “Oh, thank you, but will Mrs. Flemming——” “My wife will be delighted to welcome you.” I wonder if husbands know as much about their wives as they think they do. If I had a husband, I should hate him to bring home orphans without consulting me first. “We will send her a wire from the station,” continued the lawyer. My"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,7,"few personal belongings were soon packed. I contemplated my hat sadly before putting it on. It had originally been what I call a “Mary” hat, meaning by that the kind of hat a housemaid ought to wear on her day out—but doesn’t! A limp thing of black straw with a suitably depressed brim. With the inspiration of genius, I had kicked it once, punched it twice, dented in the crown and affixed to it a thing like a cubist’s dream of a jazz carrot. The result had been distinctly chic. The carrot I had already removed, of course, and now I proceeded to undo the rest of my handiwork. The “Mary” hat resumed its former status with an additional battered appearance which made it even more depressing than formerly. I might as well look as much like the popular conception of an orphan as possible. I was just a shade nervous of Mrs. Flemming’s reception, but hoped my appearance might have a sufficiently disarming effect. Mr. Flemming was nervous too. I realized that as we went up the stairs of the tall house in"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,8,"a quiet Kensington Square. Mrs. Flemming greeted me pleasantly enough. She was a stout, placid woman of the “good wife and mother” type. She took me up to a spotless chintz-hung bedroom, hoped I had everything I wanted, informed me that tea would be ready in about a quarter of an hour, and left me to my own devices. I heard her voice, slightly raised, as she entered the drawing-room below on the first floor. “Well, Henry, why on earth——” I lost the rest, but the acerbity of the tone was evident. And a few minutes later another phrase floated up to me, in an even more acid voice: “I agree with you! She is certainly _very_ good-looking.” It is really a very hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are. With a deep sigh I proceeded to do things to my hair. I have nice hair. It is black—a real black, not dark brown, and it grows well back from my forehead and down over the"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,9,"ears. With a ruthless hand I dragged it upwards. As ears, my ears are quite all right, but there is no doubt about it, ears are _démodé_ nowadays. They are like the “Queen of Spain’s legs” in Professor Peterson’s young day. When I had finished I looked almost unbelievably like the kind of orphan that walks out in a queue with a little bonnet and a red cloak. I noticed when I went down that Mrs. Flemming’s eyes rested on my exposed ears with quite a kindly glance. Mr. Flemming seemed puzzled. I had no doubt that he was saying to himself, “What _has_ the child done to herself?” On the whole the rest of the day passed off well. It was settled that I was to start at once to look for something to do. When I went to bed, I stared earnestly at my face in the glass. Was I really good-looking? Honestly, I couldn’t say I thought so! I hadn’t got a straight Grecian nose, or a rosebud mouth, or any of the things you ought to have. It is true"
3,The Missing Will,3,CHAPTER II,10,"that a curate once told me that my eyes were like “imprisoned sunshine in a dark, dark wood”—but curates always know so many quotations, and fire them off at random. I’d much prefer to have Irish blue eyes than dark green ones with yellow flecks! Still, green is a good colour for adventuresses. I wound a black garment tightly round me, leaving my arms and shoulders bare. Then I brushed back my hair and pulled it well down over my ears again. I put a lot of powder on my face, so that the skin seemed even whiter than usual. I fished about until I found some old lip-salve, and I put oceans of it on my lips. Then I did under my eyes with burnt cork. Finally, I draped a red ribbon over my bare shoulder, stuck a scarlet feather in my hair, and placed a cigarette in one corner of my mouth. The whole effect pleased me very much. “Anna the Adventuress,” I said aloud, nodding at my reflection. “Anna the Adventuress. Episode I, ‘The House in Kensington’!” Girls are foolish things."
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,1,"In the succeeding weeks I was a good deal bored. Mrs. Flemming and her friends seemed to me to be supremely uninteresting. They talked for hours of themselves and their children and of the difficulties of getting good milk for the children and of what they said to the Dairy when the milk wasn’t good. Then they would go on to servants, and the difficulties of getting good servants and of what they had said to the woman at the Registry Office and of what the woman at the Registry Office had said to them. They never seemed to read the papers or to care about what went on in the world. They disliked travelling—everything was so different to England. The Riviera was all right, of course, because one met all one’s friends there. I listened and contained myself with difficulty. Most of these women were rich. The whole wide beautiful world was theirs to wander in and they deliberately stayed in dirty dull London and talked about milkmen and servants! I think now, looking back, that"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,2,"I was perhaps a shade intolerant. But they _were_ stupid—stupid even at their chosen job: most of them kept the most extraordinarily inadequate and muddled housekeeping accounts. My affairs did not progress very fast. The house and furniture had been sold, and the amount realized had just covered our debts. As yet, I had not been successful in finding a post. Not that I really wanted one! I had the firm conviction that, if I went about looking for adventure, adventure would meet me halfway. It is a theory of mine that one always gets what one wants. My theory was about to be proved in practice. It was early in January—the 8th, to be exact. I was returning from an unsuccessful interview with a lady who said she wanted a secretary-companion, but really seemed to require a strong charwoman who would work twelve hours a day for £25 a year. Having parted with mutual veiled impolitenesses, I walked down Edgware Road (the interview had taken place in a house in St. John’s Wood) and across Hyde"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,3,"Park to St. George’s Hospital. There I entered Hyde Park Corner Tube Station and took a ticket to Gloucester Road. Once on the platform I walked to the extreme end of it. My inquiring mind wished to satisfy itself as to whether there really _were_ points and an opening between the two tunnels just beyond the station in the direction of Down Street. I was foolishly pleased to find I was right. There were not many people on the platform, and at the extreme end there was only myself and one man. As I passed him, I sniffed dubiously. If there is one smell I cannot bear it is that of moth balls! This man’s heavy overcoat simply reeked of them. And yet most men begin to wear their winter overcoats before January, and consequently by this time the smell ought to have worn off. The man was beyond me, standing close to the edge of the tunnel. He seemed lost in thought, and I was able to stare at him without rudeness. He was a small"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,4,"thin man, very brown of face, with light blue eyes and a small dark beard. “Just come from abroad,” I deduced. “That’s why his overcoat smells so. He’s come from India. Not an officer, or he wouldn’t have a beard. Perhaps a tea-planter.” At this moment the man turned as though to retrace his steps along the platform. He glanced at me and then his eyes went on to something behind me, and his face changed. It was distorted by fear—almost panic. He stood a step backwards as though involuntarily recoiling from some danger, forgetting that he was standing on the extreme edge of the platform, and went down and over. There was a vivid flash from the rails and a crackling sound. I shrieked. People came running up. Two station officials seemed to materialize from nowhere and took command. I remained where I was, rooted to the spot by a sort of horrible fascination. Part of me was appalled at the sudden disaster, and another part of me was coolly and dispassionately interested in the methods"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,5,"employed for lifting the man off the live rail and back onto the platform. “Let me pass, please. I am a medical man.” A tall man with a brown beard pressed past me and bent over the motionless body. As he examined it, a curious sense of unreality seemed to possess me. The thing wasn’t real—couldn’t be. Finally, the doctor stood upright and shook his head. “Dead as a door-nail. Nothing to be done.” We had all crowded nearer, and an aggrieved porter raised his voice. “Now then, stand back there, will you? What’s the sense in crowding round.” A sudden nausea seized me, and I turned blindly and ran up the stairs again towards the lift. I felt that it was too horrible. I must get out into the open air. The doctor who had examined the body was just ahead of me. The lift was just about to go up, another having descended, and he broke into a run. As he did so, he dropped a piece of paper. I stopped, picked it up, and"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,6,"ran after him. But the lift gates clanged in my face, and I was left holding the paper in my hand. By the time the second lift reached the street level, there was no sign of my quarry. I hoped it was nothing important that he had lost, and for the first time I examined it. It was a plain half-sheet of notepaper with some figures and words scrawled upon it in pencil. This is a facsimile of it: [Indistinct cursive script which appears to say something like: ""1 7 . 1 2 2 Kilmorden Castle""] On the face of it, it certainly did not appear to be of any importance. Still, I hesitated to throw it away. As I stood there holding it, I involuntarily wrinkled my nose in displeasure. Moth balls again! I held the paper gingerly to my nose. Yes, it smelt strongly of them. But, then—— I folded up the paper carefully and put it in my bag. I walked home slowly and did a good deal of thinking. I explained to Mrs."
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,7,"Flemming that I had witnessed a nasty accident in the Tube and that I was rather upset and would go to my room and lie down. The kind woman insisted on my having a cup of tea. After that I was left to my own devices, and I proceeded to carry out a plan I had formed coming home. I wanted to know what it was that had produced that curious feeling of unreality whilst I was watching the doctor examine the body. First I lay down on the floor in the attitude of the corpse, then I laid a bolster down in my stead, and proceeded to duplicate, so far as I could remember, every motion and gesture of the doctor. When I had finished I had got what I wanted. I sat back on my heels and frowned at the opposite walls. There was a brief notice in the evening papers that a man had been killed in the Tube, and a doubt was expressed whether it was suicide or accident. That seemed to me"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,8,"to make my duty clear, and when Mr. Flemming heard my story he quite agreed with me. “Undoubtedly you will be wanted at the inquest. You say no one else was near enough to see what happened?” “I had the feeling some one was coming up behind me, but I can’t be sure—and, anyway, they wouldn’t be as near as I was.” The inquest was held. Mr. Flemming made all the arrangements and took me there with him. He seemed to fear that it would be a great ordeal to me, and I had to conceal from him my complete composure. The deceased had been identified as L. B. Carton. Nothing had been found in his pockets except a house-agent’s order to view a house on the river near Marlow. It was in the name of L. B. Carton, Russell Hotel. The bureau clerk from the hotel identified the man as having arrived the day before and booked a room under that name. He had registered as L. B. Carton, Kimberley, S. Africa. He had evidently come"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,9,"straight off the steamer. I was the only person who had seen anything of the affair. “You think it was an accident?” the coroner asked me. “I am positive of it. Something alarmed him, and he stepped backwards blindly without thinking what he was doing.” “But what could have alarmed him?” “That I don’t know. But there was something. He looked panic-stricken.” A stolid juryman suggested that some men were terrified of cats. The man might have seen a cat. I didn’t think his suggestion a very brilliant one, but it seemed to pass muster with the jury, who were obviously impatient to get home and only too pleased at being able to give a verdict of accident as opposed to suicide. “It is extraordinary to me,” said the coroner, “that the doctor who first examined the body has not come forward. His name and address should have been taken at the time. It was most irregular not to do so.” I smiled to myself. I had my own theory in regard to the doctor. In"
3,The Missing Will,4,CHAPTER III,10,"pursuance of it, I determined to make a call upon Scotland Yard at an early date. But the next morning brought a surprise. The Flemmings took in the _Daily Budget,_ and the _Daily Budget_ was having a day after its own heart. EXTRAORDINARY SEQUEL TO TUBE ACCIDENT. WOMAN FOUND STABBED IN LONELY HOUSE. I read eagerly. “A sensational discovery was made yesterday at the Mill House, Marlow. The Mill House, which is the property of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P., is to be let unfurnished, and an order to view this property was found in the pocket of the man who was at first thought to have committed suicide by throwing himself on the live rail at Hyde Park Corner Tube Station. In an upper room of the Mill House the body of a beautiful young woman was discovered yesterday, strangled. She is thought to be a foreigner, but so far has not been identified. The police are reported to have a clue. Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, is wintering on the Riviera.”"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,1,"Nobody came forward to identify the dead woman. The inquest elicited the following facts. Shortly after one o’clock on January 8th, a well-dressed woman with a slight foreign accent had entered the offices of Messrs. Butler and Park, house-agents, in Knightsbridge. She explained that she wanted to rent or purchase a house on the Thames within easy reach of London. The particulars of several were given to her, including those of the Mill House. She gave the name of Mrs. de Castina and her address as the Ritz, but there proved to be no one of that name staying there, and the hotel people failed to identify the body. Mrs. James, the wife of Sir Eustace Pedler’s gardener, who acted as caretaker to the Mill House and inhabited the small lodge opening on the main road, gave evidence. About three o’clock that afternoon, a lady came to see over the house. She produced an order from the house-agents, and, as"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,2,"was the usual custom, Mrs. James gave her the keys of the house. It was situated at some distance from the lodge, and she was not in the habit of accompanying prospective tenants. A few minutes later a young man arrived. Mrs. James described him as tall and broad-shouldered, with a bronzed face and light grey eyes. He was clean-shaven and was wearing a brown suit. He explained to Mrs. James that he was a friend of the lady who had come to look over the house, but had stopped at the post office to send a telegram. She directed him to the house, and thought no more about the matter. Five minutes later he reappeared, handed her back the keys and explained that he feared the house would not suit them. Mrs. James did not see the lady, but thought that she had gone on ahead. What she did notice was that the young man seemed very much upset"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,3,"about something. “He looked like a man who’d seen a ghost. I thought he was taken ill.” On the following day another lady and gentleman came to see the property and discovered the body lying on the floor in one of the upstairs rooms. Mrs. James identified it as that of the lady who had come the day before. The house-agents also recognized it as that of “Mrs. de Castina.” The police surgeon gave it as his opinion that the woman had been dead about twenty-four hours. The _Daily Budget_ had jumped to the conclusion that the man in the Tube had murdered the woman and afterwards committed suicide. However, as the Tube victim was dead at two o’clock, and the woman was alive and well at three o’clock, the only logical conclusion to come to was that the two occurrences had nothing to do with each other, and that the order to view the house at Marlow found in"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,4,"the dead man’s pocket was merely one of those coincidences which so often occur in this life. A verdict of “Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown” was returned, and the police (and the _Daily Budget_) were left to look for “the man in the brown suit.” Since Mrs. James was positive that there was no one in the house when the lady entered it, and that nobody except the young man in question entered it until the following afternoon, it seemed only logical to conclude that he was the murderer of the unfortunate Mrs. de Castina. She had been strangled with a piece of stout black cord, and had evidently been caught unawares with no time to cry out. The black silk handbag which she carried contained a well-filled notecase and some loose change, a fine lace handkerchief, unmarked, and the return half of a first-class ticket to London. Nothing much there to go upon. Such were the"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,5,"details published broadcast by the _Daily Budget,_ and “Find the Man in the Brown Suit” was their daily war-cry. On an average about five hundred people wrote daily to announce their success in the quest, and tall young men with well-tanned faces cursed the day when their tailors had persuaded them to a brown suit. The accident in the Tube, dismissed as a coincidence, faded out of the public mind. Was it a coincidence? I was not so sure. No doubt I was prejudiced—the Tube incident was my own pet mystery—but there certainly seemed to me to be a connection of some kind between the two fatalities. In each there was a man with a tanned face—evidently an Englishman living abroad, and there were other things. It was the consideration of these other things that finally impelled me to what I considered a dashing step. I presented myself at Scotland Yard and demanded to see whoever was in charge of"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,6,"the Mill House case. My request took some time to understand, as I had inadvertently selected the department for lost umbrellas, but eventually I was ushered into a small room and presented to Detective Inspector Meadows. Inspector Meadows was a small man with a ginger head and what I considered a peculiarly irritating manner. A satellite, also in plain clothes, sat unobtrusively in a corner. “Good morning,” I said nervously. “Good morning. Will you take a seat? I understand you’ve something to tell me that you think may be of use to us.” His tone seemed to indicate that such a thing was unlikely in the extreme. I felt my temper stirred. “Of course you know about the man who was killed in the Tube? The man who had an order to view this same house at Marlow in his pocket.” “Ah!” said the inspector. “You are the Miss Beddingfeld who gave evidence at the inquest. Certainly the man had"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,7,"an order in his pocket. A lot of other people may have had too—only they didn’t happen to be killed.” I rallied my forces. “You don’t think it odd that this man had no ticket in his pocket?” “Easiest thing in the world to drop your ticket. Done it myself.” “And no money.” “He had some loose change in his trousers pocket.” “But no notecase.” “Some men don’t carry a pocket-book or notecase of any kind.” I tried another tack. “You don’t think it’s odd that the doctor never came forward afterwards?” “A busy medical man very often doesn’t read the papers. He probably forgot all about the accident.” “In fact, inspector, you are determined to find nothing odd,” I said sweetly. “Well, I’m inclined to think you’re a little too fond of the word, Miss Beddingfeld. Young ladies are romantic, I know—fond of mysteries and such-like. But as I’m a busy man——” I took the hint and rose. The"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,8,"man in the corner raised a meek voice. “Perhaps the young lady would tell us briefly what her ideas really are on the subject, inspector?” The inspector fell in with the suggestion readily enough. “Yes, come now, Miss Beddingfeld, don’t be offended. You’ve asked questions and hinted things. Just say straight out what it is you’ve got in your head.” I wavered between injured dignity and the overwhelming desire to express my theories. Injured dignity went to the wall. “You said at the inquest you were positive it wasn’t suicide?” “Yes, I’m quite certain of that. The man was frightened. What frightened him? It wasn’t me. But some one might have been walking up the platform towards us—some one he recognized.” “You didn’t see any one?” “No,” I admitted. “I didn’t turn my head. Then, as soon as the body was recovered from the line, a man pushed forward to examine it, saying he was a doctor.” “Nothing unusual in"
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,9,"that,” said the inspector dryly. “But he wasn’t a doctor.” “What?” “He wasn’t a doctor,” I repeated. “How do you know that, Miss Beddingfeld?” “It’s difficult to say, exactly. I’ve worked in Hospital during the war, and I’ve seen doctors handle bodies. There’s a sort of deft professional callousness that this man hadn’t got. Besides, a doctor doesn’t usually feel for the heart on the right side of the body.” “He did that?” “Yes, I didn’t notice it specially at the time—except that I felt there was something wrong. But I worked it out when I got home, and then I saw why the whole thing had looked so unhandy to me at the time.” “H’m,” said the inspector. He was reaching slowly for pen and paper. “In running his hands over the upper part of the man’s body he would have ample opportunity to take anything he wanted from the pockets.” “Doesn’t sound likely to me,” said the inspector."
3,The Missing Will,5,CHAPTER IV,10,"“But—well, can you describe him at all?” “He was tall and broad-shouldered, wore a dark overcoat and black boots, a bowler hat. He had a dark pointed beard and gold-rimmed eyeglasses.” “Take away the overcoat, the beard and the eyeglasses, and there wouldn’t be much to know him by,” grumbled the inspector. “He could alter his appearance easy enough in five minutes if he wanted to—which he would do if he’s the swell pickpocket you suggest.” I had not intended to suggest anything of the kind. But from this moment I gave the inspector up as hopeless. “Nothing more you can tell us about him?” he demanded, as I rose to depart. “Yes,” I said. I seized my opportunity to fire a parting shot. “His head was markedly brachycephalic. He will not find it so easy to alter that.” I observed with pleasure that Inspector Meadow’s pen wavered. It was clear that he did not know how to spell brachycephalic."
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,1,"In the first heat of indignation I found my next step unexpectedly easy to tackle. I had had a half-formed plan in my head when I went into Scotland Yard. One to be carried out if my interview there was unsatisfactory (it had been profoundly unsatisfactory). That is, if I had the nerve to go through with it. Things that one would shrink from attempting normally are easily tackled in a flush of anger. Without giving myself time to reflect, I walked straight to the house of Lord Nasby. Lord Nasby was the millionaire owner of the _Daily"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,2,"Budget._ He owned other papers—several of them, but the _Daily Budget_ was his special child. It was as the owner of the _Daily Budget_ that he was known to every householder in the United Kingdom. Owing to the fact that an itinerary of the great man’s daily proceedings had just been published, I knew exactly where to find him at this moment. It was his hour for dictating to his secretary in his own house. I did not, of course, suppose that any young woman who chose to come and ask for him would be at once admitted"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,3,"to the august presence. But I had attended to that side of the matter. In the card-tray in the hall of the Flemmings’ house I had observed the card of the Marquis of Loamsley, England’s most famous sporting peer. I had removed the card, cleaned it carefully with bread-crumbs, and pencilled upon it the words: “Please give Miss Beddingfeld a few moments of your time.” Adventuresses must not be too scrupulous in their methods. The thing worked. A powdered footman received the card and bore it away. Presently a pale secretary appeared. I fenced with him successfully. He"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,4,"retired defeated. He again reappeared and begged me to follow him. I did so. I entered a large room, a frightened-looking shorthand-typist fled past me like a visitant from the spirit-world. Then the door shut and I was face to face with Lord Nasby. A big man. Big head. Big face. Big moustache. Big stomach. I pulled myself together. I had not come here to comment on Lord Nasby’s stomach. He was already roaring at me. “Well, what is it? What does Loamsley want? You his secretary? What’s it all about?” “To begin with,” I said with as"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,5,"great an appearance of coolness as I could manage, “I don’t know Lord Loamsley, and he certainly knows nothing about me. I took his card from the tray in the house of the people I’m staying with, and I wrote those words on it myself. It was important that I should see you.” For a moment it appeared to be a toss up as to whether Lord Nasby had apoplexy or not. In the end, he swallowed twice and got over it. “I admire your coolness, young woman. Well, you see me! If you interest me, you will"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,6,"continue to see me for exactly two minutes longer.” “That will be ample,” I replied. “And I shall interest you. It’s the Mill House Mystery.” “If you’ve found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ write to the Editor,” he interrupted hastily. “If you will interrupt, I shall be more than two minutes,” I said sternly. “I haven’t found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ but I’m quite likely to do so.” In as few words as possible I put the facts of the Tube accident and the conclusions I had drawn from them before him. When I had"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,7,"finished he said unexpectedly: “What do you know of brachycephalic heads?” I mentioned Papa. “The Monkey man? Eh? Well, you seem to have a head of some kind upon your own shoulders, young woman. But it’s all pretty thin, you know. Not much to go upon. And no use to us—as it stands.” “I’m perfectly aware of that.” “What d’you want, then?” “I want a job on your paper to investigate this matter.” “Can’t do that. We’ve got our own special man on it.” “And I’ve got my own special knowledge.” “What you’ve just told me, eh?” “Oh,"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,8,"no, Lord Nasby. I’ve still got something up my sleeve.” “Oh, you have, have you? You seem a bright sort of girl. Well, what is it?” “When this so-called doctor got into the lift, he dropped a piece of paper. I picked it up. It smelt of moth balls. So did the dead man. The doctor didn’t. So I saw at once that the doctor must have taken it off the body. It had two words written on it and some figures.” “Let’s see it.” Lord Nasby stretched out a careless hand. “I think not,” I said, smiling."
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,9,"“It’s my find, you see.” “I’m right. You _are_ a bright girl. Quite right to hang on to it. No scruples about not handing it over to the police?” “I went there to do so this morning. They persisted in regarding the whole thing as having nothing to do with the Marlow affair, so I thought that in the circumstances I was justified in retaining the paper. Besides, the inspector put my back up.” “Short-sighted man. Well, my dear girl, here’s all I can do for you. Go on working on this line of yours. If you"
3,The Missing Will,6,CHAPTER V,10,"get anything—anything that’s publishable—send it along and you shall have your chance. There’s always room for real talent on the _Daily Budget._ But you’ve got to make good first. See?” I thanked him, and apologized for my methods. “Don’t mention it. I rather like cheek—from a pretty girl. By the way, you said two minutes and you’ve been three, allowing for interruptions. For a woman, that’s quite remarkable! Must be your scientific training.” I was in the street again, breathing hard as though I had been running. I found Lord Nasby rather wearing as a new acquaintance."
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,1,"I went home with a feeling of exultation. My scheme had succeeded far better than I could possibly have hoped. Lord Nasby had been positively genial. It only now remained for me to “Make good,” as he expressed it. Once locked in my own room, I took out my precious piece of paper and studied it attentively. Here was the clue to the mystery. To begin with, what did the figures represent? There were five of them, and a dot after the first two. “Seventeen—one hundred and twenty-two,” I murmured. That did not seem to lead to anything. Next I added them up. That is often done in works of fiction and leads to surprising deductions. “One and seven make eight and one is nine and two are eleven and two are thirteen.” Thirteen! Fateful number! Was this a warning to me to leave the whole thing alone? Very possibly. Anyway, except as a warning, it seemed to be singularly useless. I declined to believe that any conspirator would take that way of writing thirteen in real life. If he meant thirteen, he would write thirteen. “13”—like that. There was"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,2,"a space between the one and the two. I accordingly subtracted twenty-two from a hundred and seventy-one. The result was a hundred and fifty-nine. I did it again and made it a hundred and forty-nine. These arithmetical exercises were doubtless excellent practice, but as regarded the solution of the mystery, they seemed totally ineffectual. I left arithmetic alone, not attempting fancy division or multiplication, and went on to the words. Kilmorden Castle. That was something definite. A place. Probably the cradle of an aristocratic family. (Missing heir? Claimant to title?) Or possibly a picturesque ruin. (Buried treasure?) Yes, on the whole I inclined to the theory of buried treasure. Figures always go with buried treasure. One pace to the right, seven paces to the left, dig one foot, descend twenty-two steps. That sort of idea. I could work out that later. The thing was to get to Kilmorden Castle as quickly as possible. I made a strategic sally from my room and returned laden with books of reference. _Who’s Who_, Whitaker, a Gazetteer, a History of Scotch Ancestral Homes, and Somebody or other’s British Isles. Time passed. I searched diligently,"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,3,"but with growing annoyance. Finally, I shut the last book with a bang. There appeared to be no such place as Kilmorden Castle. Here was an unexpected check. There _must_ be such a place. Why should any one invent a name like that and write it down on a piece of paper? Absurd! Another idea occurred to me. Possibly it was a castellated abomination in the suburbs with a high-sounding name invented by its owner. But if so, it was going to be extraordinarily hard to find. I sat back gloomily on my heels (I always sit on the floor to do anything really important) and wondered how on earth I was to set about it. Was there any other line I could follow? I reflected earnestly and then sprang to my feet delightedly. Of course! I must visit the “scene of the crime.” Always done by the best sleuths! And no matter how long afterwards it may be, they always find something that the police have overlooked. My course was clear. I must go to Marlow. But how was I to get into the house? I discarded several adventurous"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,4,"methods, and plumped for stern simplicity. The house had been to let—presumably was still to let. I would be a prospective tenant. I also decided on attacking the local house-agents, as having fewer houses on their books. Here, however, I reckoned without my host. A pleasant clerk produced particulars of about half a dozen desirable properties. It took all my ingenuity to find objections to them. In the end I feared I had drawn a blank. “And you’ve really nothing else?” I asked, gazing pathetically into the clerk’s eyes. “Something right on the river, and with a fair amount of garden and a small lodge,” I added, summing up the main points of the Mill House, as I had gathered them from the papers. “Well, of course there’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s place,” said the man doubtfully. “The Mill House, you know.” “Not—not where——” I faltered. (Really, faltering is getting to be my strong point.) “That’s it! Where the murder took place. But perhaps you wouldn’t like——” “Oh, I don’t think I should mind,” I said with an appearance of rallying. I felt my _bona fides_ was now quite established. “And"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,5,"perhaps I might get it cheap—in the circumstances.” A master touch that, I thought. “Well, it’s possible. There’s no pretending that it will be easy to let now—servants and all that, you know. If you like the place after you’ve seen it, I should advise you to make an offer. Shall I write you out an order?” “If you please.” A quarter of an hour later I was at the lodge of the Mill House. In answer to my knock, the door flew open and a tall middle-aged woman literally bounced out. “Nobody can go into the house, do you hear that? Fairly sick of you reporters, I am. Sir Eustace’s orders are——” “I understood the house was to let,” I said freezingly, holding out my order. “Of course, if it’s already taken——” “Oh, I’m sure I beg your pardon, miss. I’ve been fairly pestered with these newspaper people. Not a minute’s peace. No, the house isn’t let—nor likely to be now.” “Are the drains wrong?” I asked in an anxious whisper. “Oh, Lord, miss, the _drains_ is all right! But surely you’ve heard about that foreign lady as was"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,6,"done to death here?” “I believe I did read something about it in the papers,” I said carelessly. My indifference piqued the good woman. If I had betrayed any interest, she would probably have closed up like an oyster. As it was, she positively bridled. “I should say you did, miss! It’s been in all the newspapers. The _Daily Budget’s_ out still to catch the man who did it. It seems, according to them, as our police are no good at all. Well, I hope they’ll get him—although a nice-looking young fellow he was and no mistake. A kind of soldierly look about him—ah, well, I dare say he’d been wounded in the war, and sometimes they go a bit queer afterwards, my sister’s boy did. Perhaps she’d used him bad—they’re a bad lot, those foreigners. Though she was a fine-looking woman. Stood there where you’re standing now.” “Was she dark or fair?” I ventured. “You can’t tell from these newspaper portraits.” “Dark hair, and a very white face—too white for nature, I thought, and her lips reddened something cruel. I don’t like to see it—a little powder now"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,7,"and then is quite another thing.” We were conversing like old friends now. I put another question. “Did she seem nervous or upset at all?” “Not a bit. She was smiling to herself, quiet like, as though she was amused at something. That’s why you could have knocked me down with a feather when, the next afternoon, those people came running out calling for the police and saying there’d been murder done. I shall never get over it, and as for setting foot in that house after dark I wouldn’t do it, not if it was ever so. Why, I wouldn’t even stay here at the lodge, if Sir Eustace hadn’t been down on his bended knees to me.” “I thought Sir Eustace Pedler was at Cannes?” “So he was, miss. He come back to England when he heard the news, and, as to the bended knees, that was a figure of speech, his secretary, Mr. Pagett, having offered us double pay to stay on, and, as my John says, money is money nowadays.” I concurred heartily with John’s by no means original remarks. “The young man now,” said"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,8,"Mrs. James, reverting suddenly to a former point in the conversation. “He was upset. His eyes, light eyes, they were, I noticed them particular, was all shining. Excited, _I_ thought. But I never dreamt of anything being wrong. Not even when he came out again looking all queer.” “How long was he in the house?” “Oh, not long, a matter of five minutes maybe.” “How tall was he, do you think? About six foot?” “I should say so maybe.” “He was clean-shaven, you say?” “Yes, miss—not even one of these toothbrush moustaches.” “Was his chin at all shiny?” I asked on a sudden impulse. Mrs. James stared at me with awe. “Well, now you come to mention it, miss, it _was._ However did you know?” “It’s a curious thing, but murderers often have shiny chins,” I explained wildly. Mrs. James accepted the statement in all good faith. “Really, now, miss. I never heard that before.” “You didn’t notice what kind of a head he had, I suppose?” “Just the ordinary kind, miss. I’ll fetch you the keys, shall I?” I accepted them, and went on my way to the"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,9,"Mill House. My reconstructions so far I considered good. All along I had realized that the differences between the man Mrs. James had described and my Tube “doctor” were those of non-essentials. An overcoat, a beard, gold-rimmed eyeglasses. The “doctor” had appeared middle-aged, but I remembered that he had stooped over the body like a comparatively young man. There had been a suppleness which told of young joints. The victim of the accident (the Moth Ball man, as I called him to myself) and the foreign woman, Mrs. de Castina, or whatever her real name was, had had an assignation to meet at the Mill House. That was how I pieced the thing together. Either because they feared they were being watched or for some other reason, they chose the rather ingenious method of both getting an order to view the same house. Thus their meeting there might have the appearance of pure chance. That the Moth Ball man had suddenly caught sight of the “doctor,” and that the meeting was totally unexpected and alarming to him, was another fact of which I was fairly sure. What had happened"
3,The Missing Will,7,CHAPTER VI,10,"next? The “doctor” had removed his disguise and followed the woman to Marlow. But it was possible that had he removed it rather hastily traces of spirit-gum might still linger on his chin. Hence my question to Mrs. James. Whilst occupied with my thoughts I had arrived at the low old-fashioned door of the Mill House. Unlocking it with the key, I passed inside. The hall was low and dark, the place smelt forlorn and mildewy. In spite of myself, I shivered. Did the woman who had come here “smiling to herself” a few days ago feel no chill of premonition as she entered this house? I wondered. Did the smile fade from her lips, and did a nameless dread close round her heart? Or had she gone upstairs, smiling still, unconscious of the doom that was so soon to overtake her? My heart beat a little faster. Was the house really empty? Was doom waiting for me in it also? For the first time, I understood the meaning of the much-used word, “atmosphere.” There was an atmosphere in this house, an atmosphere of cruelty, of menace, of evil."
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,1,"Shaking off the feelings that oppressed me, I went quickly upstairs. I had no difficulty in finding the room of the tragedy. On the day the body was discovered it had rained heavily, and large muddy boots had trampled the uncarpeted floor in every direction. I wondered if the murderer had left any footmarks the previous day. It was likely that the police would be reticent on the subject if he had, but on consideration I decided it was unlikely. The weather had been fine and dry. There was nothing of interest about the room. It was almost square with two big bay windows, plain white walls and a bare floor, the boards being stained round the edges where the carpet had ceased. I searched it carefully,"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,2,"but there was not so much as a pin lying about. The gifted young detective did not seem likely to discover a neglected clue. I had brought with me a pencil and notebook. There did not seem much to note, but I duly dotted down a brief sketch of the room to cover my disappointment at the failure of my quest. As I was in the act of returning the pencil to my bag, it slipped from my fingers and rolled along the floor. The Mill House was really old, and the floors were very uneven. The pencil rolled steadily, with increasing momentum, until it came to rest under one of the windows. In the recess of each window there was a broad window-seat, underneath which there"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,3,"was a cupboard. My pencil was lying right against the cupboard door. The cupboard was shut, but it suddenly occurred to me that if it had been open my pencil would have rolled inside. I opened the door, and my pencil immediately rolled in and sheltered modestly in the farthest corner. I retrieved it, noting as I did so that owing to the lack of light and the peculiar formation of the cupboard one could not see it, but had to feel for it. Apart from my pencil the cupboard was empty, but being thorough by nature I tried the one under the opposite window. At first sight, it looked as though that also was empty, but I grubbed about perseveringly, and was rewarded by feeling my"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,4,"hand close on a hard paper cylinder which lay in a sort of trough, or depression, in the far corner of the cupboard. As soon as I had it in my hand, I knew what it was. A roll of Kodak films. Here was a find! I realized, of course, that these films might very well be an old roll belonging to Sir Eustace Pedler which had rolled in here and had not been found when the cupboard was emptied. But I did not think so. The red paper was far too fresh-looking. It was just as dusty as it would have been had it laid there for two or three days—that is to say, since the murder. Had it been there for any length of time,"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,5,"it would have been thickly coated. Who had dropped it? The woman or the man? I remembered that the contents of her handbag had appeared to be intact. If it had been jerked open in the struggle and the roll of films had fallen out, surely some of the loose money would have been scattered about also? No, it was not the woman who had dropped the films. I sniffed suddenly and suspiciously. Was the smell of moth balls becoming an obsession with me? I could swear that the roll of films smelt of it also? I held them under my nose. They had, as usual, a strong smell of their own, but apart from that I could clearly detect the odour I disliked so much. I"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,6,"soon found the cause. A minute shred of cloth had caught on a rough edge of the centre wood, and that shred was strongly impregnated with moth balls. At some time or another the films had been carried in the overcoat pocket of the man who was killed in the Tube. Was it he who had dropped them here? Hardly. His movements were all accounted for. No, it was the other man, the “doctor.” He had taken the films when he had taken the paper. It was he who had dropped them here during his struggle with the woman. I had got my clue! I would have the roll developed, and then I would have further developments to work upon. Very elated, I left the house, returned"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,7,"the keys to Mrs. James and made my way as quickly as possible to the station. On the way back to town, I took out my paper and studied it afresh. Suddenly the figures took on a new significance. Suppose they were a date? 17 1 22. The 17th of January, 1922. Surely that must be it! Idiot that I was not to have thought of it before. But in that case I _must_ find out the whereabouts of Kilmorden Castle, for to-day was actually the 14th. Three days. Little enough—almost hopeless when one had no idea of where to look! It was too late to hand in my roll to-day. I had to hurry home to Kensington so as not to be late for dinner. It"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,8,"occurred to me that there was an easy way of verifying whether some of my conclusions were correct. I asked Mr. Flemming whether there had been a camera amongst the dead man’s belongings. I knew that he had taken an interest in the case and was conversant with all the details. To my surprise and annoyance he replied that there had been no camera. All Carton’s effects had been gone over very carefully in the hopes of finding something that might throw light upon his state of mind. He was positive that there had been no photographic apparatus of any kind. That was rather a set-back to my theory. If he had no camera, why should he be carrying a roll of films? I set out early"
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,9,"next morning to take my precious roll to be developed. I was so fussy that I went all the way to Regent Street to the big Kodak place. I handed it in and asked for a print of each film. The man finished stacking together a heap of films packed in yellow tin cylinders for the tropics, and picked up my roll. He looked at me. “You’ve made a mistake, I think,” he said, smiling. “Oh, no,” I said. “I’m sure I haven’t.” “You’ve given me the wrong roll. This is an _unexposed_ one.” I walked out with what dignity I could muster. I dare say it is good for one now and again to realize what an idiot one can be! But nobody relishes the process."
3,The Missing Will,8,CHAPTER VII,10,"And then, just as I was passing one of the big shipping offices, I came to a sudden halt. In the window was a beautiful model of one of the company’s boats, and it was labelled “Kenilworth Castle.” A wild idea shot through my brain. I pushed the door open and went in. I went up to the counter and in faltering voice (genuine this time!) I murmured: “Kilmorden Castle?” “On the 17th from Southampton. Cape Town? First or second class?” “How much is it?” “First class, eighty-seven pounds——” I interrupted him. The coincidence was too much for me. Exactly the amount of my legacy! I would put all my eggs in one basket. “First class,” I said. I was now definitely committed to the adventure."
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,1,"_(Extracts from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler, M.P.)_ It is an extraordinary thing that I never seem to get any peace. I am a man who likes a quiet life. I like my Club, my rubber of Bridge, a well-cooked meal, a sound wine. I like England in the summer, and the Riviera in the winter. I have no desire to participate in sensational happenings. Sometimes, in front of a good fire, I do not object to reading about them in the newspaper. But that is as far as I am willing to go. My object in life is to be thoroughly comfortable. I have devoted a certain amount of thought, and a considerable amount of money, to further that end. But I cannot say that I always succeed. If things do not actually happen to me, they happen round me, and frequently, in spite of myself, I become involved. I hate being involved. All this because Guy Pagett came into my bedroom this morning with a telegram in his hand and a face as long as a mute at a funeral. Guy Pagett is my secretary, a zealous, painstaking, hard-working fellow, admirable in every respect. I know no"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,2,"one who annoys me more. For a long time I have been racking my brains as to how to get rid of him. But you cannot very well dismiss a secretary because he prefers work to play, likes getting up early in the morning, and has positively no vices. The only amusing thing about the fellow is his face. He has the face of a fourteenth-century poisoner—the sort of man the Borgias got to do their odd jobs for them. I wouldn’t mind so much if Pagett didn’t make me work too. My idea of work is something that should be undertaken lightly and airily—trifled with, in fact! I doubt if Guy Pagett has ever trifled with anything in his life. He takes everything seriously. That is what makes him so difficult to live with. Last week I had the brilliant idea of sending him off to Florence. He talked about Florence and how much he wanted to go there. “My dear fellow,” I cried, “you shall go to-morrow. I will pay all your expenses.” January isn’t the usual time for going to Florence, but it would be all one to Pagett. I could imagine him going about, guide-book in"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,3,"hand, religiously doing all the picture galleries. And a week’s freedom was cheap to me at the price. It has been a delightful week. I have done everything I wanted to, and nothing that I did not want to do. But when I blinked my eyes open, and perceived Pagett standing between me and the light at the unearthly hour of 9 a.m. this morning, I realized that freedom was over. “My dear fellow,” I said, “has the funeral already taken place, or is it for later in the morning?” Pagett does not appreciate dry humour. He merely stared. “So you know, Sir Eustace?” “Know what?” I said crossly. “From the expression of your face I inferred that one of your near and dear relatives was to be interred this morning.” Pagett ignored the sally as far as possible. “I thought you couldn’t know about this.” He tapped the telegram. “I know you dislike being aroused early—but it _is_ nine o’clock”—Pagett insists on regarding 9 a.m. as practically the middle of the day—“and I thought that under the circumstances——” He tapped the telegram again. “What is that thing?” I asked. “It’s a telegram from the police at Marlow. A woman"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,4,"has been murdered in your house.” That aroused me in earnest. “What colossal cheek,” I exclaimed. “Why in _my_ house? Who murdered her?” “They don’t say. I suppose we shall go back to England at once, Sir Eustace?” “You need suppose nothing of the kind. Why should we go back?” “The police——” “What on earth have I to do with the police?” “Well, it was your house.” “That,” I said, “appears to be more my misfortune than my fault.” Guy Pagett shook his head gloomily. “It will have a very unfortunate effect upon the constituency,” he remarked lugubriously. I don’t see why it should have—and yet I have a feeling that in such matters Pagett’s instincts are always right. On the face of it, a Member of Parliament will be none the less efficient because a stray young woman comes and gets herself murdered in an empty house that belongs to him—but there is no accounting for the view the respectable British public takes of a matter. “She’s a foreigner too, and that makes it worse,” continued Pagett gloomily. Again I believe he is right. If it is disreputable to have a woman murdered in your house, it becomes more"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,5,"disreputable if the woman is a foreigner. Another idea struck me. “Good heavens,” I exclaimed, “I hope this won’t upset Caroline.” Caroline is the lady who cooks for me. Incidentally she is the wife of my gardener. What kind of a wife she makes I do not know, but she is an excellent cook. James, on the other hand, is not a good gardener—but I support him in idleness and give him the lodge to live in solely on account of Caroline’s cooking. “I don’t suppose she’ll stay after this,” said Pagett. “You always were a cheerful fellow,” I said. I expect I shall have to go back to England. Pagett clearly intends that I shall. And there is Caroline to pacify. _Three days later._ It is incredible to me that any one who can get away from England in winter does not do so! It is an abominable climate. All this trouble is very annoying. The house-agents say it will be next to impossible to let the Mill House after all the publicity. Caroline has been pacified—with double pay. We could have sent her a cable to that effect from Cannes. In fact, as I have said all along,"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,6,"there was no earthly purpose to serve by our coming over. I shall go back to-morrow. _One day later._ Several very surprising things have occurred. To begin with, I met Augustus Milray, the most perfect example of an old ass the present Government has produced. His manner oozed diplomatic secrecy as he drew me aside in the Club into a quiet corner. He talked a good deal. About South Africa and the industrial situation there. About the growing rumours of a strike on the Rand. Of the secret causes actuating that strike. I listened as patiently as I could. Finally, he dropped his voice to a whisper and explained that certain documents had come to light which ought to be placed in the hands of General Smuts. “I’ve no doubt you’re quite right,” I said, stifling a yawn. “But how are we to get them to him? Our position in the matter is delicate—very delicate.” “What’s wrong with the post?” I said cheerfully. “Put a two-penny stamp on and drop ’em in the nearest letter-box.” He seemed quite shocked at the suggestion. “My dear Pedler! The common post!” It has always been a mystery to me why Governments employ Kings’"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,7,"Messengers and draw such attention to their confidential documents. “If you don’t like the post, send one of your young Foreign Office fellows. He’ll enjoy the trip.” “Impossible,” said Milray, wagging his head in a senile fashion. “There are reasons, my dear Pedler—I assure you there are reasons.” “Well,” I said, rising, “all this is very interesting, but I must be off——” “One minute, my dear Pedler, one minute, I beg of you. Now tell me, in confidence, is it not true that you intend visiting South Africa shortly yourself? You have large interests in Rhodesia, I know, and the question of Rhodesia joining in the Union is one in which you have a vital interest.” “Well, I had thought of going out in about a month’s time.” “You couldn’t possibly make it sooner? This month? This week, in fact?” “I could,” I said, eyeing him with some interest. “But I don’t know that I particularly want to.” “You would be doing the Government a great service—a very great service. You would not find them—er—ungrateful.” “Meaning, you want me to be the postman?” “Exactly. Your position is an unofficial one, your journey is _bona fide._ Everything would be eminently"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,8,"satisfactory.” “Well,” I said slowly, “I don’t mind if I do. The one thing I am anxious to do is to get out of England again as soon as possible.” “You will find the climate of South Africa delightful—quite delightful.” “My dear fellow, I know all about the climate. I was out there shortly before the war.” “I am really much obliged to you, Pedler. I will send you round the package by messenger. To be placed in General Smuts’s own hands, you understand? The _Kilmorden Castle_ sails on Saturday—quite a good boat.” I accompanied him a short way along Pall Mall before we parted. He shook me warmly by the hand, and thanked me again effusively. I walked home reflecting on the curious by-ways of Governmental policy. It was the following evening that Jarvis, my butler, informed me that a gentleman wished to see me on private business, but declined to give his name. I have always a lively apprehension of insurance touts, so told Jarvis to say I could not see him. Guy Pagett, unfortunately, when he might for once have been of real use, was laid up with a bilious attack. These earnest, hard-working young men"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,9,"with weak stomachs are always liable to bilious attacks. Jarvis returned. “The gentleman asked me to tell you, Sir Eustace, that he comes to you from Mr. Milray.” That altered the complexion of things. A few minutes later I was confronting my visitor in the library. He was a well-built young fellow with a deeply tanned face. A scar ran diagonally from the corner of his eye to the jaw, disfiguring what would otherwise have been a handsome though somewhat reckless countenance. “Well,” I said, “what’s the matter?” “Mr. Milray sent me to you, Sir Eustace. I am to accompany you to South Africa as your secretary.” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I’ve got a secretary already. I don’t want another.” “I think you do, Sir Eustace. Where is your secretary now?” “He’s down with a bilious attack,” I explained. “You are sure it’s only a bilious attack?” “Of course it is. He’s subject to them.” My visitor smiled. “It may or may not be a bilious attack. Time will show. But I can tell you this, Sir Eustace, Mr. Milray would not be surprised if an attempt were made to get your secretary out of the way. Oh,"
3,The Missing Will,9,CHAPTER VIII,10,"you need have no fear for yourself”—I suppose a momentary alarm had flickered across my face—“you are not threatened. Your secretary out of the way, access to you would be easier. In any case, Mr. Milray wishes me to accompany you. The passage-money will be our affair, of course, but you will take the necessary steps about the passport, as though you had decided that you needed the services of a second secretary.” He seemed a determined young man. We stared at each other and he stared me down. “Very well,” I said feebly. “You will say nothing to any one as to my accompanying you.” “Very well,” I said again. After all, perhaps it was better to have this fellow with me, but I had a premonition that I was getting into deep waters. Just when I thought I had attained peace! I stopped my visitor as he was turning to depart. “It might be just as well if I knew my new secretary’s name,” I observed sarcastically. He considered for a minute. “Harry Rayburn seems quite a suitable name,” he observed. It was a curious way of putting it. “Very well,” I said for the third time."
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ It is most undignified for a heroine to be sea-sick. In books the more it rolls and tosses, the better she likes it. When everybody else is ill, she alone staggers along the deck, braving the elements and positively rejoicing in the storm. I regret to say that at the first roll the _Kilmorden_ gave, I turned pale and hastened below. A sympathetic stewardess received me. She suggested dry toast and ginger ale. I remained groaning in my cabin for three days. Forgotten was my quest. I had no longer any interest in solving mysteries. I was a totally different Anne to the one who had rushed back to the South Kensington square so jubilantly from the shipping office. I smile now as I remember my abrupt entry into the drawing-room. Mrs. Flemming was alone there. She turned her head as I entered. “Is that you, Anne, my dear? There is something I want to talk over with you.” “Yes?” I said, curbing my impatience. “Miss Emery is leaving me.” Miss Emery was the governness. “As you have not yet succeeded in finding anything, I wondered if you would care—it would be so nice if you remained with us altogether?” I was touched. She didn’t want me, I knew. It was sheer Christian charity that prompted the offer. I felt remorseful for my secret criticism of her. Getting up, I ran impulsively across the room and flung my arms round her neck. “You’re a dear,” I said. “A dear, a dear, a dear! And thank you ever so much. But it’s all right, I’m off to South Africa on Saturday.” My abrupt onslaught had startled the good lady. She was not used to sudden demonstrations of affection. My words startled her still more. “To South Africa? My dear Anne. We would have to look into anything of that kind very carefully.”"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,2,"That was the last thing I wanted. I explained that I had already taken my passage, and that upon arrival I proposed to take up the duties of a parlourmaid. It was the only thing I could think of on the spur of the moment. There was, I said, a great demand for parlourmaids in South Africa. I assured her that I was equal to taking care of myself, and in the end, with a sigh of relief at getting me off her hands, she accepted the project without further query. At parting, she slipped an envelope into my hand. Inside it I found five new crisp five-pound notes and the words: “I hope you will not be offended and will accept this with my love.” She was a very good, kind woman. I could not have continued to live in the same house with her, but I did recognize her intrinsic worth. So here I was, with twenty-five pounds in my pocket, facing the world and pursuing my adventure. It was on the fourth day that the stewardess finally urged me up on deck. Under the impression that I should die quicker below, I had steadfastly refused to leave my bunk. She now tempted me with the advent of Madeira. Hope rose in my breast. I could leave the boat and go ashore and be a parlourmaid there. Anything for dry land. Muffled in coats and rugs, and weak as a kitten on my legs, I was hauled up and deposited, an inert mass, on a deck-chair. I lay there with my eyes closed, hating life. The purser, a fair-haired young man, with a round boyish face, came and sat down beside me. “Hullo! Feeling rather sorry for yourself, eh?” “Yes,” I replied, hating him. “Ah, you won’t know yourself in another day or two. We’ve had rather a nasty dusting in the"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,3,"Bay, but there’s smooth weather ahead. I’ll be taking you on at quoits to-morrow.” I did not reply. “Think you’ll never recover, eh? But I’ve seen people much worse than you, and two days later they were the life and soul of the ship. You’ll be the same.” I did not feel sufficiently pugnacious to tell him outright that he was a liar. I endeavoured to convey it by a glance. He chatted pleasantly for a few minutes more, then he mercifully departed. People passed and repassed, brisk couples “exercising,” curveting children, laughing young people. A few other pallid sufferers lay, like myself, in deck-chairs. The air was pleasant, crisp, not too cold, and the sun was shining brightly. Insensibly, I felt a little cheered. I began to watch the people. One woman in particular attracted me. She was about thirty, of medium height and very fair with a round dimpled face and very blue eyes. Her clothes, though perfectly plain, had that indefinable air of “cut” about them which spoke of Paris. Also, in a pleasant but self-possessed way, she seemed to own the ship! Deck stewards ran to and fro obeying her commands. She had a special deck-chair, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of cushions. She changed her mind three times as to where she would like it placed. Throughout everything she remained attractive and charming. She appeared to be one of those rare people in the world who know what they want, see that they get it, and manage to do so without being offensive. I decided that if I ever recovered—but of course I shouldn’t—it would amuse me to talk to her. We reached Madeira about midday. I was still too inert to move, but I enjoyed the picturesque-looking merchants who came on board and spread their merchandise about the decks. There were flowers too. I buried my nose in"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,4,"an enormous bunch of sweet wet violets and felt distinctly better. In fact, I thought I might just possibly last out the end of the voyage. When my stewardess spoke of the attractions of a little chicken broth, I only protested feebly. When it came I enjoyed it. My attractive woman had been ashore. She came back escorted by a tall, soldierly-looking man with dark hair and a bronzed face whom I had noticed striding up and down the deck earlier in the day. I put him down at once as one of the strong, silent men of Rhodesia. He was about forty, with a touch of greying hair at either temple, and was easily the best-looking man on board. When the stewardess brought me up an extra rug I asked her if she knew who my attractive woman was. “That’s a well-known society lady, the Hon. Mrs. Clarence Blair. You must have read about her in the papers.” I nodded, looking at her with renewed interest. Mrs. Blair was very well known indeed as one of the smartest women of the day. I observed, with some amusement, that she was the centre of a good deal of attention. Several people essayed to scrape acquaintance with the pleasant informality that a boat allows. I admired the polite way that Mrs. Blair snubbed them. She appeared to have adopted the strong, silent man as her special cavalier, and he seemed duly sensible of the privilege accorded him. The following morning, to my surprise, after taking a few turns round the deck with her attentive companion, Mrs. Blair came to a halt by my chair. “Feeling better this morning?” I thanked her, and said I felt slightly more like a human being. “You did look ill yesterday. Colonel Race and I decided that we should have the excitement of a funeral at sea—but you’ve disappointed"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,5,"us.” I laughed. “Being up in the air has done me good.” “Nothing like fresh air,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “Being shut up in those stuffy cabins would kill any one,” declared Mrs. Blair, dropping into a seat by my side and dismissing her companion with a little nod. “You’ve got an outside one, I hope?” I shook my head. “My dear girl! Why don’t you change? There’s plenty of room. A lot of people got off at Madeira, and the boat’s very empty. Talk to the purser about it. He’s a nice little boy—he changed me into a beautiful cabin because I didn’t care for the one I’d got. You talk to him at lunch-time when you go down.” I shuddered. “I couldn’t move.” “Don’t be silly. Come and take a walk now with me.” She dimpled at me encouragingly. I felt very weak on my legs at first, but as we walked briskly up and down I began to feel a brighter and better being. After a turn or two, Colonel Race joined us again. “You can see the Grand Peak of Tenerife from the other side.” “Can we? Can I get a photograph of it, do you think?” “No—but that won’t deter you from snapping off at it.” Mrs. Blair laughed. “You are unkind. Some of my photographs are very good.” “About three per cent effective, I should say.” We all went round to the other side of the deck. There glimmering white and snowy, enveloped in a delicate rose-coloured mist, rose the glistening pinnacle. I uttered an exclamation of delight. Mrs. Blair ran for her camera. Undeterred by Colonel Race’s sardonic comments, she snapped vigorously: “There, that’s the end of the roll. Oh,” her tone changed to one of chagrin, “I’ve had the thing at ‘bulb’ all the time.” “I always like to see a child with a new"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,6,"toy,” murmured the Colonel. “How horrid you are—but I’ve got another roll.” She produced it in triumph from the pocket of her sweater. A sudden roll of the boat upset her balance, and as she caught at the rail to steady herself the roll of films flashed over the side. “Oh!” cried Mrs. Blair, comically dismayed. She leaned over. “Do you think they have gone overboard?” “No, you may have been fortunate enough to brain an unlucky steward in the deck below.” A small boy who had arrived unobserved a few paces to our rear blew a deafening blast on a bugle. “Lunch,” declared Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “I’ve had nothing to eat since breakfast, except two cups of beef-tea. Lunch, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Well,” I said waveringly. “Yes, I _do_ feel rather hungry.” “Splendid. You’re sitting at the purser’s table, I know. Tackle him about the cabin.” I found my way down to the saloon, began to eat gingerly, and finished by consuming an enormous meal. My friend of yesterday congratulated me on my recovery. Every one was changing cabins to-day, he told me, and he promised that my things should be moved to an outside one without delay. There were only four at our table, myself, a couple of elderly ladies, and a missionary who talked a lot about “our poor black brothers.” I looked round at the other tables. Mrs. Blair was sitting at the Captain’s table, Colonel Race next to her. On the other side of the Captain was a distinguished-looking, grey-haired man. A good many people I had already noticed on deck, but there was one man who had not previously appeared. Had he done so, he could hardly have escaped my notice. He was tall and dark, and had such a peculiarly sinister type of countenance that I was quite startled. I asked the purser, with some curiosity, who"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,7,"he was. “That man? Oh, that’s Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary. Been very sea-sick, poor chap, and not appeared before. Sir Eustace has got two secretaries with him, and the sea’s been too much for both of them. The other fellow hasn’t turned up yet. This man’s name is Pagett.” So Sir Eustace Pedler, the owner of the Mill House, was on board. Probably only a coincidence, and yet—— “That’s Sir Eustace,” my informant continued, “sitting next to the Captain. Pompous old ass.” The more I studied the secretary’s face, the less I liked it. Its even pallor, the secretive, heavy-lidded eyes, the curiously flattened head—it all gave me a feeling of distaste, of apprehension. Leaving the saloon at the same time as he did, I was close behind him as he went up on deck. He was speaking to Sir Eustace, and I overheard a fragment or two. “I’ll see about the cabin at once then, shall I? It’s impossible to work in yours, with all your trunks.” “My dear fellow,” Sir Eustace replied. “My cabin is intended (a) for me to sleep in, and (b) to attempt to dress in. I never had any intentions of allowing you to sprawl about the place making an infernal clicking with that typewriter of yours.” “That’s just what I say, Sir Eustace, we must have somewhere to work——” Here I parted company from them, and went below to see if my removal was in progress. I found my steward busy at the task. “Very nice cabin, miss. On D deck. No. 13.” “Oh, no!” I cried. “_Not_ 13.” Thirteen is the one thing I am superstitious about. It was a nice cabin too. I inspected it, wavered, but a foolish superstition prevailed. I appealed almost tearfully to the steward. “Isn’t there any other cabin I can have?” The steward reflected. “Well, there’s 17, just along"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,8,"on the starboard side. That was empty this morning, but I rather fancy it’s been allotted to some one. Still, as the gentleman’s things aren’t in yet, and as gentlemen aren’t anything like so superstitious as ladies, I dare say he wouldn’t mind changing.” I hailed the proposition gratefully, and the steward departed to obtain permission from the purser. He returned grinning. “That’s all right, miss. We can go along.” He led the way to 17. It was not quite as large as No. 13, but I found it eminently satisfactory. “I’ll fetch your things right away, miss,” said the steward. But at that moment, the man with the sinister face (as I had nicknamed him) appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me,” he said, “but this cabin is reserved for the use of Sir Eustace Pedler.” “That’s all right, sir,” explained the steward. “We’re fitting up No. 13 instead.” “No, it was No. 17 I was to have.” “No. 13 is a better cabin, sir—larger.” “I specially selected No. 17, and the purser said I could have it.” “I’m sorry,” I said coldly. “But No. 17 has been allotted to me.” “I can’t agree to that.” The steward put in his oar. “The other cabin’s just the same, only better.” “I want No. 17.” “What’s all this?” demanded a new voice. “Steward, put my things in here. This is my cabin.” It was my neighbor at lunch, the Rev. Edward Chichester. “I beg your pardon,” I said. “It’s my cabin.” “It is allotted to Sir Eustace Pedler,” said Mr. Pagett. We were all getting rather heated. “I’m sorry to have to dispute the matter,” said Chichester with a meek smile which failed to mask his determination to get his own way. Meek men are always obstinate, I have noticed. He edged himself sideways into the doorway. “You’re to have No. 28 on the"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,9,"port side,” said the steward. “A very good cabin, sir.” “I am afraid that I must insist. No. 17 was the cabin promised to me.” We had come to an impasse. Each one of us was determined not to give way. Strictly speaking, I, at any rate, might have retired from the contest and eased matters by offering to accept Cabin 28. So long as I did not have 13 it was immaterial to me what other cabin I had. But my blood was up. I had not the least intention of being the first to give way. And I disliked Chichester. He had false teeth which clicked when he ate. Many men have been hated for less. We all said the same things over again. The steward assured us, even more strongly, that both the other cabins were better cabins. None of us paid any attention to him. Pagett began to lose his temper. Chichester kept his serenely. With an effort I also kept mine. And still none of us would give way an inch. A wink and a whispered word from the steward gave me my cue. I faded unobtrusively from the scene. I was lucky enough to encounter the purser almost immediately. “Oh, please,” I said, “you did say I could have Cabin 17? And the others won’t go away. Mr. Chichester and Mr. Pagett. You _will_ let me have it, won’t you?” I always say that there are no people like sailors for being nice to women. My little purser came to the scratch splendidly. He strode to the scene, informed the disputants that No. 17 was my cabin, they could have Nos. 13 and 28 respectively or stay where they were—whichever they chose. I permitted my eyes to tell him what a hero he was and then installed myself in my new domain. The encounter had done me"
3,The Missing Will,10,CHAPTER IX,10,"worlds of good. The sea was smooth, the weather growing daily warmer. Sea-sickness was a thing of the past! I went up on deck and was initiated into the mysteries of deck-quoits. I entered my name for various sports. Tea was served on deck, and I ate heartily. After tea, I played shovel-board with some pleasant young men. They were extraordinarily nice to me. I felt that life was satisfactory and delightful. The dressing bugle came as a surprise and I hurried to my new cabin. The stewardess was awaiting me with a troubled face. “There’s a terrible smell in your cabin, miss. What it is, I’m sure I can’t think, but I doubt if you’ll be able to sleep here. There’s a deck cabin up on C deck, I believe. You might move into that—just for the night, anyway.” The smell really was pretty bad—quite nauseating. I told the stewardess I would think over the question of moving whilst I dressed. I hurried over my toilet, sniffing distastefully as I did so. What _was_ the smell? Dead rat? No, worse than that—and quite different. Yet I knew it! It was something I had smelt before. Something——Ah! I had got it. Asafœtida! I had worked in a Hospital dispensary during the war for a short time and had become acquainted with various nauseous drugs. Asafœtida, that was it. But how—— I sank down on the sofa, suddenly realizing the thing. Somebody had put a pinch of asafœtida in my cabin. Why? So that I should vacate it? Why were they so anxious to get me out? I thought of the scene this afternoon from a rather different point of view. What was there about Cabin 17 that made so many people anxious to get hold of it? The other two cabins were better cabins, why had both men insisted on sticking to 17?"

3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,1,"I was violently excited. I was sure that I had hit on the right trail at last. One thing was clear, I must not move out of the cabin. The asafœtida had got to be borne. I examined my facts again. To-morrow was the 22nd, and at 1 a.m. or 1 p.m. something would happen. I plumped for 1 a.m. It was now seven o’clock. In six hours I should know. I don’t know how I got through the evening. I retired to my cabin fairly early. I had told the stewardess that I had a cold in the head and didn’t mind smells. She still seemed distressed, but I was firm. The evening seemed interminable. I duly retired to bed, but in view of emergencies I swathed myself in a thick flannel dressing-gown, and encased my feet in slippers. Thus attired"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,2,"I felt that I could spring up and take an active part in anything that happened. What did I expect to happen? I hardly knew. Vague fancies, most of them wildly improbable, flitted through my brain. But one thing I was firmly convinced of, at one o’clock _something_ would happen. At various times, I heard my fellow-passengers coming to bed. Fragments of conversation, laughing good-nights, floated in through the open transom. Then, silence. Most of the lights went out. There was still one in the passage outside, and there was therefore a certain amount of light in my cabin. I heard eight bells go. The hour that followed seemed the longest I had ever known. I consulted my watch surreptitiously to be sure I had not overshot the time. If my deductions were wrong, if nothing happened at one o’clock, I"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,3,"should have made a fool of myself, and spent all the money I had in the world on a mare’s-nest. My heart beat painfully. Two bells went overhead. One o’clock! And nothing. Wait—what was that? I heard the quick light patter of feet running—running along the passage. Then with the suddenness of a bombshell my cabin door burst open and a man almost fell inside. “Save me,” he said hoarsely. “They’re after me.” It was not a moment for argument or explanation. I could hear footsteps outside. I had about forty seconds in which to act. I had sprung to my feet and was standing facing the stranger in the middle of the cabin. A cabin does not abound in hiding-places for a six-foot man. With one arm I pulled out my cabin trunk. He slipped down behind it under the"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,4,"bunk. I raised the lid. At the same time, with the other hand I pulled down the wash-basin. A deft movement and my hair was screwed into a tiny knot on the top of my head. From the point of view of appearance it was inartistic, from another standpoint it was supremely artistic. A lady, with her hair screwed into an unbecoming knob and in the act of removing a piece of soap from her trunk with which, apparently to wash her neck, could hardly be suspected of harbouring a fugitive. There was a knock at the door, and without waiting for me to say, “Come in,” it was pushed open. I don’t know what I expected to see. I think I had vague ideas of Mr. Pagett brandishing a revolver. Or my missionary friend with a sandbag, or some other"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,5,"lethal weapon. But certainly I did not expect to see a night stewardess, with an inquiring face and looking the essence of respectability. “I beg your pardon, miss, I thought you called out.” “No,” I said, “I didn’t.” “I’m sorry for interrupting you.” “That’s all right,” I said. “I couldn’t sleep. I thought a wash would do me good.” It sounded rather as though it were a thing I never had as a general rule. “I’m so sorry, miss,” said the stewardess again. “But there’s a gentleman about who’s rather drunk, and we are afraid he might get into one of the ladies’ cabins and frighten them.” “How dreadful,” I said, looking alarmed. “He won’t come in here, will he?” “Oh, I don’t think so, miss. Ring the bell if he does. Good night.” “Good night.” I opened the door and"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,6,"peeped down the corridor. Except for the retreating form of the stewardess, there was nobody in sight. Drunk! So that was the explanation of it. My histrionic talents had been wasted. I pulled the cabin trunk out a little farther and said: “Come out at once, please,” in an acid voice. There was no answer. I peered under the bunk. My visitor lay immovable. He seemed to be asleep. I tugged at his shoulder. He did not move. “Dead drunk,” I thought vexedly. “What _am_ I to do?” Then I saw something that made me catch my breath, a small scarlet spot on the floor. Using all my strength, I succeeded in dragging the man out into the middle of the cabin. The dead whiteness of his face showed that he had fainted. I found the cause of his fainting easily"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,7,"enough. He had been stabbed under the left shoulder-blade—a nasty deep wound. I got his coat off and set to work to attend to it. At the sting of the cold water he stirred, then sat up. “Keep still, please,” I said. He was the kind of young man who recovers his faculties very quickly. He pulled himself to his feet and stood there swaying a little. “Thank you, I don’t need anything done for me.” His manner was defiant, almost aggressive. Not a word of thanks—of even common gratitude! “That is a nasty wound. You must let me dress it.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” He flung the words in my face as though I had been begging a favour of him. My temper, never placid, rose. “I cannot congratulate you upon your manners,” I said coldly. “I"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,8,"can at least relieve you of my presence.” He started for the door, but reeled as he did so. With an abrupt movement I pushed him down upon the sofa. “Don’t be a fool,” I said unceremoniously. “You don’t want to go bleeding all over the ship, do you?” He seemed to see the sense of that, for he sat quietly whilst I bandaged up the wound as best I could. “There,” I said, bestowing a pat on my handiwork, “that will have to do for the present. Are you better tempered now and do you feel inclined to tell me what it’s all about?” “I’m sorry that I can’t satisfy your very natural curiosity.” “Why not?” I said, chagrined. He smiled nastily. “If you want a thing broadcasted, tell a woman. Otherwise keep your mouth shut.” “Don’t you think I"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,9,"could keep a secret?” “I don’t think—I know.” He rose to his feet. “At any rate,” I said spitefully, “I shall be able to do a little broadcasting about the events of this evening.” “I’ve no doubt you will too,” he said indifferently. “How dare you?” I cried angrily. We were facing each other, glaring at each other with the ferocity of bitter enemies. For the first time, I took in the details of his appearance, the close-cropped dark head, the lean jaw, the scar on the brown cheek, the curious light grey eyes that looked into mine with a sort of reckless mockery hard to describe. There was something dangerous about him. “You haven’t thanked me yet for saving your life?” I said with false sweetness. I hit him there. I saw him flinch distinctly. Intuitively I knew that he"
3,The Missing Will,12,CHAPTER X,10,"hated above all to be reminded that he owed his life to me. I didn’t care. I wanted to hurt him. I had never wanted to hurt any one so much. “I wish to God you hadn’t!” he said explosively. “I’d be better dead and out of it.” “I’m glad you acknowledge the debt. You can’t get out of it. I saved your life and I’m waiting for you to say ‘Thank you.’” If looks could have killed, I think he would have liked to kill me then. He pushed roughly past me. At the door he turned back, and spoke over his shoulder. “I shall not thank you—now or at any other time. But I acknowledge the debt. Some day I will pay it.” He was gone, leaving me with clenched hands, and my heart beating like a mill race."
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,1,"There were no further excitements that night. I had breakfast in bed and got up late the next morning. Mrs. Blair hailed me as I came on deck. “Good-morning, Gipsy girl, sit down here by me. You look as though you hadn’t slept well.” “Why do you call me that?” I asked, as I sat down obediently. “Do you mind? It suits you somehow. I’ve called you that in my own mind from the beginning. It’s the gipsy element in you that makes you so different from any one else. I decided in my own mind that you and Colonel Race were the only two people on board who wouldn’t bore me to death to talk to.” “That’s funny,” I said, “I thought the same about you—only it’s more understandable in your case. You’re—you’re such an exquisitely finished product.” “Not badly put,” said Mrs. Blair, nodding her head. “Tell me all about yourself, Gipsy girl. Why are you going to South Africa?” I told her something about Papa’s life work. “So you’re Charles Beddingfeld’s daughter? I thought you weren’t a mere provincial Miss! Are you going to Broken Hill to grub up more skulls?” “I may,” I said cautiously. “I’ve got other plans as well.” “What a mysterious minx you are. But you do look tired this"
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,2,"morning. Didn’t you sleep well? I can’t keep awake on board a boat. Ten hours’ sleep for a fool, they say! I could do with twenty!” She yawned, looking like a sleepy kitten. “An idiot of a steward woke me up in the middle of the night to return me that roll of films I dropped yesterday. He did it in the most melodramatic manner, stuck his arm through the ventilator and dropped them nearly in the middle of my tummy. I thought it was a bomb for a moment!” “Here’s your Colonel,” I said, as the tall soldierly figure of Colonel Race appeared on the deck. “He’s not my Colonel particularly. In fact he admires _you_ very much, Gipsy girl. So don’t run away.” “I want to tie something round my head. It will be more comfortable than a hat.” I slipped quickly away. For some reason or other I was uncomfortable with Colonel Race. He was one of the few people who were capable of making me feel shy. I went down to my cabin and began looking for a broad band of ribbon, or a motor-veil, with which I could restrain my rebellious locks. Now I am a tidy person, I like my things always arranged in a certain way and I keep them"
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,3,"so. I had no sooner opened my drawer than I realized that somebody had been disarranging my things. Everything had been turned over and scattered. I looked in the other drawers and the small hanging cupboard. They told me the same tale. It was as though some one had been making a hurried and ineffectual search for something. I sat down on the edge of the bunk with a grave face. Who had been searching my cabin and what had they been looking for? Was it the half-sheet of paper with scribbled figures and words? I shook my head, dissatisfied. Surely that was past history now. But what else could there be? I wanted to think. The events of last night, though exciting, had not really done anything to elucidate matters. Who was the young man who had burst into my cabin so abruptly? I had not seen him on board previously, either on deck or in the saloon. Was he one of the ship’s company or was he a passenger? Who had stabbed him? Why had they stabbed him? And why, in the name of goodness, should Cabin No. 17 figure so prominently? It was all a mystery, but there was no doubt that some very peculiar occurrences were taking place on the _Kilmorden Castle._ I"
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,4,"counted off on my fingers the people on whom it behoved me to keep a watch. Setting aside my visitor of the night before, but promising myself that I would discover him on board before another day had passed, I selected the following persons as worthy of my notice. (1) Sir Eustace Pedler. He was the owner of the Mill House and his presence on the _Kilmorden Castle_ seemed something of a coincidence. (2) Mr. Pagett, the sinister-looking secretary, whose eagerness to obtain Cabin 17 had been so very marked. N.B. Find out whether he had accompanied Sir Eustace to Cannes. (3) The Rev. Edward Chichester. All I had against him was his obstinacy over Cabin 17, and that might be entirely due to his own peculiar temperament. Obstinacy can be an amazing thing. But a little conversation with Mr. Chichester would not come amiss, I decided. Hastily tying a handkerchief round my rebellious locks, I went up on deck again, full of purpose. I was in luck. My quarry was leaning against the rail, drinking beef tea. I went up to him. “I hope you’ve forgiven me over Cabin 17,” I said, with my best smile. “I consider it unchristian to bear a grudge,” said Mr. Chichester coldly. “But the purser had distinctly promised me that"
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,5,"cabin.” “Pursers are such busy men, aren’t they?” I said vaguely. “I suppose they’re bound to forget sometimes.” Mr. Chichester did not reply. “Is this your first visit to Africa?” I inquired conversationally. “To South Africa, yes. But I have worked for the last two years amongst the cannibal tribes in the interior of East Africa.” “How thrilling! Have you had many narrow escapes?” “Escapes?” “Of being eaten, I mean?” “You should not treat sacred subjects with levity, Miss Beddingfeld.” “I didn’t know that cannibalism was a sacred subject,” I retorted, stung. As the words left my lips, another idea struck me. If Mr. Chichester had indeed spent the last two years in the interior of Africa, how was it that he was not more sunburnt? His skin was as pink and white as a baby’s. Surely there was something fishy there? Yet his manner and voice were so absolutely _it._ Too much so perhaps. Was he—or was he not—just a little like a _stage_ clergyman? I cast my mind back to the curates I had known at Little Hampsly. Some of them I had liked, some of them I had not, but certainly none of them had been quite like Mr. Chichester. They had been human—he was a glorified type. I was debating all this when"
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,6,"Sir Eustace Pedler passed down the deck. Just as he was abreast of Mr. Chichester, he stooped and picked up a piece of paper which he handed to him, remarking “You’ve dropped something.” He passed on without stopping, and so probably did not notice Mr. Chichester’s agitation. I did. Whatever it was he had dropped, its recovery agitated him considerably. He turned a sickly green, and crumpled up the sheet of paper into a ball. My suspicions were accentuated a hundred-fold. He caught my eye, and hurried into explanations. “A—a—fragment of a sermon I was composing,” he said with a sickly smile. “Indeed?” I rejoined politely. A fragment of a sermon, indeed! No, Mr. Chichester—too weak for words! He soon left me with a muttered excuse. I wished, oh, how I wished, that I had been the one to pick up that paper and not Sir Eustace Pedler! One thing was clear, Mr. Chichester could not be exempted from my list of suspects. I was inclined to put him top of the three. After lunch, when I came up to the lounge for coffee, I noticed Sir Eustace and Pagett sitting with Mrs. Blair and Colonel Race. Mrs. Blair welcomed me with a smile, so I went over and joined them. They were talking about Italy."
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,7,"“But it _is_ misleading,” Mrs. Blair insisted. _“Aqua calda_ certainly _ought_ to be cold water—not hot.” “You’re not a Latin scholar,” said Sir Eustace, smiling. “Men are so superior about their Latin,” said Mrs. Blair. “But all the same I notice that when you ask them to translate inscriptions in old churches they can never do it! They hem and haw, and get out of it somehow.” “Quite right,” said Colonel Race. “I always do.” “But I love the Italians,” continued Mrs. Blair. “They’re so obliging—though even that has its embarrassing side. You ask them the way somewhere, and instead of saying ‘first to the right, second to the left’ or something that one could follow, they pour out a flood of well-meaning directions, and when you look bewildered they take you kindly by the arm and walk all the way there with you.” “Is that your experience in Florence, Pagett?” asked Sir Eustace, turning with a smile to his secretary. For some reason the question seemed to disconcert Mr. Pagett. He stammered and flushed. “Oh, quite so, yes—er quite so.” Then with a murmured excuse, he rose and left the table. “I am beginning to suspect Guy Pagett of having committed some dark deed in Florence,” remarked Sir Eustace, gazing after his secretary’s retreating figure."
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,8,"“Whenever Florence or Italy is mentioned, he changes the subject, or bolts precipitately.” “Perhaps he murdered some one there,” said Mrs. Blair hopefully. “He looks—I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, Sir Eustace—but he does look as though he might murder some one.” “Yes, pure Cinquecento! It amuses me sometimes—especially when one knows as well as I do how essentially law-abiding and respectable the poor fellow really is.” “He’s been with you some time, hasn’t he, Sir Eustace?” asked Colonel Race. “Six years,” said Sir Eustace, with a deep sigh. “He must be quite invaluable to you,” said Mrs. Blair. “Oh, invaluable! Yes, quite invaluable.” The poor man sounded even more depressed, as though the invaluableness of Mr. Pagett was a secret grief to him. Then he added more briskly: “But his face should really inspire you with confidence, my dear lady. No self-respecting murderer would ever consent to look like one. Crippen, now, I believe, was one of the pleasantest fellows imaginable.” “He was caught on a liner, wasn’t he?” murmured Mrs. Blair. There was a slight rattle behind us. I turned quickly. Mr. Chichester had dropped his coffee-cup. Our party soon broke up; Mrs. Blair went below to sleep and I went out on deck. Colonel Race followed me. “You’re very elusive, Miss Beddingfeld."
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,9,"I looked for you everywhere last night at the dance.” “I went to bed early,” I explained. “Are you going to run away to-night too? Or are you going to dance with me?” “I shall be very pleased to dance with you,” I murmured shyly. “But Mrs. Blair——” “Our friend, Mrs. Blair, doesn’t care for dancing.” “And you do?” “I care for dancing with you.” “Oh!” I said nervously. I was a little afraid of Colonel Race. Nevertheless I was enjoying myself. This was better than discussing fossilized skulls with stuffy old professors! Colonel Race was really just my ideal of a stern silent Rhodesian. Possibly I might marry him! I hadn’t been asked, it is true, but, as the Boy Scouts say, Be Prepared! And all women, without in the least meaning it, consider every man they meet as a possible husband for themselves or for their best friend. I danced several times with him that evening. He danced well. When the dancing was over, and I was thinking of going to bed, he suggested a turn round the deck. We walked round three times and finally subsided into two deck-chairs. There was nobody else in sight. We made desultory conversation for some time. “Do you know, Miss Beddingfeld, I think that I once met"
3,The Missing Will,13,CHAPTER XI,10,"your father? A very interesting man—on his own subject, and it’s a subject that has a special fascination for me. In my humble way, I’ve done a bit in that line myself. Why, when I was in the Dordogne region——” Our talk became technical. Colonel Race’s boast was not an idle one. He knew a great deal. At the same time, he made one or two curious mistakes—slips of the tongue, I might almost have thought them. But he was quick to take his cue from me and to cover them up. Once he spoke of the Mousterian period as succeeding the Aurignacian—an absurd mistake for one who knew anything of the subject. It was twelve o’clock when I went to my cabin. I was still puzzling over those queer discrepancies. Was it possible that he had “got the whole subject up” for the occasion—that really he knew nothing of archaeology? I shook my head, vaguely dissatisfied with that solution. Just as I was dropping off to sleep, I sat up with a sudden start as another idea flashed into my head. Had _he_ been pumping _me?_ Were those slight inaccuracies just tests—to see whether I really knew what I was talking about? In other words, he suspected me of not being genuinely Anne Beddingfeld. Why?"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,1,"_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_ There is something to be said for life on board ship. It is peaceful. My grey hairs fortunately exempt me from the indignities of bobbing for apples, running up and down the deck with potatoes and eggs, and the more painful sports of “Brother Bill” and Bolster Bar. What amusement people can find in these painful proceedings has always been a mystery to me. But there are many fools in the world. One praises God for their existence and keeps out of their way. Fortunately I am an excellent sailor. Pagett, poor fellow, is not. He began turning green as soon as we were out of the Solent. I presume my other so-called secretary is also sea-sick. At any rate he has not yet made his appearance. But perhaps it is not sea-sickness, but high diplomacy. The great thing is that I have not been worried by him. On the whole, the people on board are a mangy lot. Only two decent Bridge players and one decent-looking woman—Mrs. Clarence Blair. I’ve met her in town of course. She is"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,2,"one of the only women I know who can lay claim to a sense of humour. I enjoy talking to her, and should enjoy it more if it were not for a long-legged taciturn ass who has attached himself to her like a limpet. I cannot think that this Colonel Race really amuses her. He’s good-looking in his way, but dull as ditch water. One of these strong silent men that lady novelists and young girls always rave over. Guy Pagett struggled up on deck after we left Madeira and began babbling in a hollow voice about work. What the devil does any one want to work for on board ship? It is true that I promised my publishers my “Reminiscences” early in the summer, but what of it? Who really reads reminiscences? Old ladies in the suburbs. And what do my reminiscences amount to? I’ve knocked against a certain number of so-called famous people in my lifetime. With the assistance of Pagett, I invent insipid anecdotes about them. And, the truth of the matter is, Pagett is too honest for the job. He won’t let me"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,3,"invent anecdotes about the people I might have met but haven’t. I tried kindness with him. “You look a perfect wreck still, my dear chap,” I said easily. “What you need is a deck-chair in the sun. No—not another word. The work must wait.” The next thing I knew he was worrying about an extra cabin. “There’s no room to work in your cabin, Sir Eustace. It’s full of trunks.” From his tone, you might have thought that trunks were blackbeetles, something that had no business to be there. I explained to him that, though he might not be aware of the fact, it was usual to take a change of clothing with one when travelling. He gave the wan smile with which he always greets my attempts at humour, and then reverted to the business in hand. “And we could hardly work in my little hole.” I know Pagett’s “little holes”—he usually has the best cabin on the ship. “I’m sorry the Captain didn’t turn out for you this time,” I said sarcastically. “Perhaps you’d like to dump some of your extra luggage in my cabin?”"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,4,"Sarcasm is dangerous with a man like Pagett. He brightened up at once. “Well, if I could get rid of the typewriter and the stationery trunk——” The stationery trunk weighs several solid tons. It causes endless unpleasantness with the porters, and it is the aim of Pagett’s life to foist it on me. It is a perpetual struggle between us. He seems to regard it as my special personal property. I, on the other hand, regard the charge of it as the only thing where a secretary is really useful. “We’ll get an extra cabin,” I said hastily. The thing seemed simple enough, but Pagett is a person who loves to make mysteries. He came to me the next day with a face like a Renaissance conspirator. “You know you told me to get Cabin 17 for an office?” “Well, what of it? Has the stationery trunk jammed in the doorway?” “The doorways are the same size in all the cabins,” replied Pagett seriously. “But I tell you, Sir Eustace, there’s something very queer about that cabin.” Memories of reading _The Upper Berth_ floated through my mind."
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,5,"“If you mean that it’s haunted,” I said, “we’re not going to sleep there, so I don’t see that it matters. Ghosts don’t affect typewriters.” Pagett said that it wasn’t a ghost, and that, after all, he hadn’t got Cabin 17. He told me a long, garbled story. Apparently he, and a Mr. Chichester, and a girl called Beddingfeld, had almost come to blows over the cabin. Needless to say, the girl had won, and Pagett was apparently feeling sore over the matter. “Both 13 and 28 are better cabins,” he reiterated. “But they wouldn’t look at them.” “Well,” I said, stifling a yawn, “for that matter, no more would you, my dear Pagett.” He gave me a reproachful look. “You _told_ me to get Cabin 17.” There is a touch of the “boy upon the burning deck” about Pagett. “My dear fellow,” I said testily, “I mentioned No. 17 because I happened to observe that it was vacant. But I didn’t mean you to make a stand to the death about it—13 or 28 would have done us equally well.” He looked hurt. “There’s something more,"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,6,"though,” he insisted. “Miss Beddingfeld got the cabin, but this morning I saw Chichester coming out of it in a furtive sort of way.” I looked at him severely. “If you’re trying to get up a nasty scandal about Chichester, who is a missionary—though a perfectly poisonous person—and that attractive child, Anne Beddingfeld, I don’t believe a word of it,” I said coldly. “Anne Beddingfeld is an extremely nice girl—with particularly good legs. I should say she had far and away the best legs on board.” Pagett did not like my reference to Anne Beddingfeld’s legs. He is the sort of man who never notices legs himself—or, if he does, would die sooner than say so. Also he thinks my appreciation of such things frivolous. I like annoying Pagett, so I continued maliciously: “As you’ve made her acquaintance, you might ask her to dine at our table to-morrow night. It’s the Fancy Dress dance. By the way, you’d better go down to the barber and select a fancy costume for me.” “Surely you will not go in fancy dress?” said Pagett, in tones of horror. I could"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,7,"see that it was quite incompatible with his idea of my dignity. He looked shocked and pained. I had really had no intention of donning fancy dress, but the complete discomfiture of Pagett was too tempting to be forborne. “What do you mean?” I said. “Of course I shall wear fancy dress. So will you.” Pagett shuddered. “So go down to the barber’s and see about it,” I finished. “I don’t think he’ll have any out sizes,” murmured Pagett, measuring my figure with his eye. Without meaning it, Pagett can occasionally be extremely offensive. “And order a table for six in the saloon,” I said. “We’ll have the Captain, the girl with the nice legs, Mrs. Blair——” “You won’t get Mrs. Blair without Colonel Race,” Pagett interposed. “He’s asked her to dine with him, I know.” Pagett always knows everything. I was justifiably annoyed. “Who _is_ Race?” I demanded, exasperated. As I said before, Pagett always knows everything—or thinks he does. He looked mysterious again. “They say he’s a Secret Service chap, Sir Eustace. Rather a great gun too. But of course I don’t know for certain.”"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,8,"“Isn’t that like the Government?” I exclaimed. “Here’s a man on board whose business it is to carry about secret documents, and they go giving them to a peaceful outsider, who only asks to be let alone.” Pagett looked even more mysterious. He came a pace nearer and dropped his voice. “If you ask me, the whole thing is very queer, Sir Eustace. Look at that illness of mine before we started——” “My dear fellow,” I interrupted brutally, “that was a bilious attack. You’re always having bilious attacks.” Pagett winced slightly. “It wasn’t the usual sort of bilious attack. This time—— “For God’s sake, don’t go into the details of your condition, Pagett. I don’t want to hear them.” “Very well, Sir Eustace. But my belief is that I was deliberately _poisoned!”_ “Ah!” I said. “You’ve been talking to Rayburn.” He did not deny it. “At any rate, Sir Eustace, _he_ thinks so—and he should be in a position to know.” “By the way, where is the chap?” I asked. “I’ve not set eyes on him since we came on board.” “He gives out that he’s ill,"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,9,"and stays in his cabin, Sir Eustace.” Pagett’s voice dropped again. “But that’s _camouflage,_ I’m sure. So that he can watch better.” “Watch?” “Over your safety, Sir Eustace. In case an attack should be made upon you.” “You’re such a cheerful fellow, Pagett,” I said. “I trust that your imagination runs away with you. If I were you I should go to the dance as a death’s head or an executioner. It will suit your mournful style of beauty.” That shut him up for the time being. I went on deck. The Beddingfeld girl was deep in conversation with the missionary parson, Chichester. Women always flutter round parsons. A man of my figure hates stooping, but I had the courtesy to pick up a bit of paper that was fluttering round the parson’s feet. I got no word of thanks for my pains. As a matter of fact, I couldn’t help seeing what was written on the sheet of paper. There was just one sentence: “Don’t try to play a lone hand or it will be the worse for you.” That’s a nice thing for a"
3,The Missing Will,14,CHAPTER XII,10,"parson to have. Who is this fellow Chichester, I wonder? He _looks_ mild as milk. But looks are deceptive. I shall ask Pagett about him. Pagett always knows everything. I sank gracefully into my deck-chair by the side of Mrs. Blair, thereby interrupting her _tête-à-tête_ with Race, and remarked that I didn’t know what the clergy were coming to nowadays. Then I asked her to dine with me on the night of the Fancy Dress dance. Somehow or other Race managed to get included in the invitation. After lunch the Beddingfeld girl came and sat with us for coffee. I was right about her legs. They _are_ the best on the ship. I shall certainly ask her to dinner as well. I would very much like to know what mischief Pagett was up to in Florence. Whenever Italy is mentioned, he goes to pieces. If I did not know how intensely respectable he is—I should suspect him of some disreputable _amour_ . . . I wonder now! Even the most respectable men——It would cheer me up enormously if it was so. Pagett—with a guilty secret! Splendid!"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,1,"It has been a curious evening. The only costume that fitted me in the barber’s emporium was that of a Teddy Bear. I don’t mind playing bears with some nice young girls on a winter’s evening in England—but it’s hardly an ideal costume for the equator. However, I created a good deal of merriment, and won first prize for “brought on board”—an absurd term for a costume hired for the evening. Still as nobody seemed to have the least idea whether they were made or brought, it didn’t matter. Mrs. Blair refused to dress up. Apparently she is at one with Pagett on the matter. Colonel Race followed her example. Anne Beddingfeld had concocted a gipsy costume for herself, and looked extraordinarily well. Pagett said he had a headache and didn’t appear. To replace him I asked a quaint little fellow called Reeves. He’s a prominent member of the South African Labour party. Horrible little man, but I want to keep in with him, as he gives me information that I need. I want to understand this Rand business from both sides. Dancing was a hot affair. I danced twice"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,2,"with Anne Beddingfeld and she had to pretend she liked it. I danced once with Mrs. Blair, who didn’t trouble to pretend, and I victimized various other damsels whose appearance struck me favourably. Then we went down to supper. I had ordered champagne; the steward suggested Clicquot 1911 as being the best they had on the boat and I fell in with his suggestion. I seemed to have hit on the one thing that would loosen Colonel Race’s tongue. Far from being taciturn, the man became actually talkative. For a while this amused me, then it occurred to me that Colonel Race, and not myself, was becoming the life and soul of the party. He chaffed me at length about keeping a diary. “It will reveal all your indiscretions one of these days, Pedler.” “My dear Race,” I said, “I venture to suggest that I am not quite the fool you think me. I may commit indiscretions, but I don’t write them down in black and white. After my death, my executors will know my opinion of a great many people, but I doubt if they will find anything to"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,3,"add or detract from their opinion of _me._ A diary is useful for recording the idiosyncrasies of other people—but not one’s own.” “There is such a thing as unconscious self-revelation, though.” “In the eyes of the psycho-analyst, all things are vile,” I replied sententiously. “You must have had a very interesting life, Colonel Race?” said Miss Beddingfeld, gazing at him with wide, starry eyes. That’s how they do it, these girls! Othello charmed Desdemona by telling her stories, but, oh, didn’t Desdemona charm Othello by the way she listened? Anyway, the girl set Race off all right. He began to tell lion stories. A man who has shot lions in large quantities has an unfair advantage over other men. It seemed to me that it was time I, too, told a lion story. One of a more sprightly character. “By the way,” I remarked, “that reminds me of a rather exciting tale I heard. A friend of mine was out on a shooting trip somewhere in East Africa. One night he came out of his tent for some reason, and was startled by a low growl. He turned sharply and"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,4,"saw a lion crouching to spring. He had left his rifle in the tent. Quick as thought, he ducked, and the lion sprang right over his head. Annoyed at having missed him, the animal growled and prepared to spring again. Again he ducked, and again the lion sprang right over him. This happened a third time, but by now he was close to the entrance of the tent, and he darted in and seized his rifle. When he emerged, rifle in hand, the lion had disappeared. That puzzled him greatly. He crept round the back of the tent, where there was a little clearing. There, sure enough, was the lion, busily practising low jumps.” This was received with a roar of applause. I drank some champagne. “On another occasion,” I remarked, “this friend of mine had a second curious experience. He was trekking across country, and being anxious to arrive at his destination before the heat of the day he ordered his boys to inspan whilst it was still dark. They had some trouble in doing so, as the mules were very restive, but at last they managed it, and"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,5,"a start was made. The mules raced along like the wind, and when daylight came they saw why. In the darkness, the boys had inspanned a lion as the near wheeler.” This, too, was well received, a ripple of merriment going round the table, but I am not sure that the greatest tribute did not come from my friend, the Labour Member, who remained pale and serious. “My God!” he said anxiously. “Who un’arnessed them?” “I must go to Rhodesia,” said Mrs. Blair. “After what you have told us, Colonel Race, I simply must. It’s a horrible journey though, five days in the train.” “You must join me on my private car,” I said gallantly. “Oh, Sir Eustace, how sweet of you, do you really mean it?” “Do I mean it!” I exclaimed reproachfully, and drank another glass of champagne. “Just about another week, and we shall be in South Africa,” sighed Mrs. Blair. “Ah, South Africa,” I said sentimentally, and began to quote from a recent speech of mine at the Colonial Institute. “What has South Africa to show the world? What indeed? Her fruit and her farms,"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,6,"her wool and her wattles, her herds and her hides, her gold and her diamonds——” I was hurrying on, because I knew that as soon as I paused Reeves would butt in and inform me that the hides were worthless because the animals hung themselves up on barbed wire or something of that sort, would crab everything else, and end up with the hardships of the miners on the Rand. And I was not in the mood to be abused as a Capitalist. However, the interruption came from another source at the magic word diamonds. “Diamonds!” said Mrs. Blair ecstatically. “Diamonds!” breathed Miss Beddingfeld. They both addressed Colonel Race. “I suppose you’ve been to Kimberley?” I had been to Kimberley too, but I didn’t manage to say so in time. Race was being inundated with questions. What were mines like? Was it true that the natives were kept shut up in compounds? And so on. Race answered their questions and showed a good knowledge of his subject. He described the methods of housing the natives, the searches instituted, and the various precautions that De Beers took. “Then it’s practically"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,7,"impossible to steal any diamonds?” asked Mrs. Blair with as keen an air of disappointment as though she had been journeying there for the express purpose. “Nothing’s impossible, Mrs. Blair. Thefts do occur—like the case I told you of where the Kafir hid the stone in his wound.” “Yes, but on a large scale?” “Once, in recent years. Just before the War in fact. You must remember the case, Pedler. You were in South Africa at the time?” I nodded. “Tell us,” cried Miss Beddingfeld. “Oh, do tell us!” Race smiled. “Very well, you shall have the story. I suppose most of you have heard of Sir Laurence Eardsley, the great South African mining magnate? His mines were gold mines, but he comes into the story through his son. You may remember that just before the War rumours were afield of a new potential Kimberley hidden somewhere in the rocky floor of the British Guiana jungles. Two young explorers, so it was reported, had returned from that part of South America bringing with them a remarkable collection of rough diamonds, some of them of considerable size. Diamonds of small"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,8,"size had been found before in the neighbourhood of the Essequibo and Mazaruni rivers, but these two young men, John Eardsley and his friend Lucas, claimed to have discovered beds of great carbon deposits at the common head of two streams. The diamonds were of every colour, pink, blue, yellow, green, black, and the purest white. Eardsley and Lucas came to Kimberley where they were to submit their gems to inspection. At the same time a sensational robbery was found to have taken place at De Beers. When sending diamonds to England they are made up into a packet. This remains in the big safe, of which the two keys are held by two different men whilst a third man knows the combination. They are handed to the Bank, and the Bank send them to England. Each package is worth, roughly, about £100,000. “On this occasion, the Bank were struck by something a little unusual about the sealing of the packet. It was opened, and found to contain knobs of sugar! “Exactly how suspicion came to fasten on John Eardsley I do not know. It was remembered that he"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,9,"had been very wild at Cambridge and that his father had paid his debts more than once. Anyhow, it soon got about that this story of South American diamond fields was all a fantasy. John Eardsley was arrested. In his possession was found a portion of the De Beer diamonds. “But the case never came to court. Sir Laurence Eardsley paid over a sum equal to the missing diamonds and De Beers did not prosecute. Exactly how the robbery was committed has never been known. But the knowledge that his son was a thief broke the old man’s heart. He had a stroke shortly afterwards. As for John, his Fate was in a way merciful. He enlisted, went to the War, fought there bravely, and was killed, thus wiping out the stain on his name. Sir Laurence himself had a third stroke and died about a month ago. He died intestate and his vast fortune passed to his next of kin, a man whom he hardly knew.” The Colonel paused. A babel of ejaculations and questions broke out. Something seemed to attract Miss Beddingfeld’s attention, and she turned in"
3,The Missing Will,15,CHAPTER XIII,10,"her chair. At the little gasp she gave, I, too, turned. My new secretary, Rayburn, was standing in the doorway. Under his tan, his face had the pallor of one who has seen a ghost. Evidently Race’s story had moved him profoundly. Suddenly conscious of our scrutiny, he turned abruptly and disappeared. “Do you know who that is?” asked Anne Beddingfeld abruptly. “That’s my other secretary,” I explained. “Mr. Rayburn. He’s been seedy up to now.” She toyed with the bread by her plate. “Has he been your secretary long?” “Not very long,” I said cautiously. But caution is useless with a woman, the more you hold back, the more she presses forward. Anne Beddingfeld made no bones about it. “How long?” she asked bluntly. “Well—er—I engaged him just before I sailed. Old friend of mine recommended him.” She said nothing more, but relapsed into a thoughtful silence. I turned to Race with the feeling that it was my turn to display an interest in his story. “Who is Sir Laurence’s next of kin, Race? Do you know?” “I should say so,” he replied, with a smile. “I am!”"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ It was on the night of the Fancy Dress dance that I decided that the time had come for me to confide in some one. So far I had played a lone hand and rather enjoyed it. Now suddenly everything was changed. I distrusted my own judgment and for the first time a feeling of loneliness and desolation crept over me. I sat on the edge of my bunk, still in my gipsy dress, and considered the situation. I thought first of Colonel Race. He had seemed to like me. He would be kind, I was sure. And he was no fool. Yet, as I thought it over, I wavered. He was a man of commanding personality. He would take the whole matter out of my hands. And it was _my_ mystery! There were other reasons, too, which I would hardly acknowledge to myself, but which made it inadvisable to confide in Colonel Race. Then I thought of Mrs. Blair. She, too, had been kind to me. I did not delude myself into the belief that that really meant anything. It was probably a mere whim of the moment. All the same, I had it in my power to interest her. She was a woman who had experienced most of the ordinary sensations of life. I proposed to supply her with an extraordinary one!"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,2,"And I liked her; liked her ease of manner, her lack of sentimentality, her freedom from any form of affectation. My mind was made up. I decided to seek her out then and there. She would hardly be in bed yet. Then I remembered that I did not know the number of her cabin. My friend, the night stewardess, would probably know. I rang the bell. After some delay it was answered by a man. He gave me the information I wanted. Mrs. Blair’s cabin was No. 71. He apologized for the delay in answering the bell, but explained that he had all the cabins to attend to. “Where is the stewardess, then?” I asked. “They all go off duty at ten o’clock.” “No—I mean the night stewardess.” “No stewardess on at night, miss.” “But—but a stewardess came the other night—about one o’clock.” “You must have been dreaming, miss. There’s no stewardess on duty after ten.” He withdrew and I was left to digest this morsel of information. Who was the woman who had come to my cabin on the night of the 22nd? My face grew graver as I realized the cunning and audacity of my unknown antagonists. Then, pulling myself together, I left my own cabin and sought that of Mrs. Blair. I knocked at the door. “Who’s that?” called her voice from within. “It’s"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,3,"me—Anne Beddingfeld.” “Oh, come in, Gipsy girl.” I entered. A good deal of scattered clothing lay about, and Mrs. Blair herself was draped in one of the loveliest kimonos I had ever seen. It was all orange and gold and black and made my mouth water to look at it. “Mrs. Blair,” I said abruptly, “I want to tell you the story of my life—that is, if it isn’t too late, and you won’t be bored.” “Not a bit. I always hate going to bed,” said Mrs. Blair, her face crinkling into smiles in the delightful way it had. “And I should love to hear the story of your life. You’re a most unusual creature, Gipsy girl. Nobody else would think of bursting in on me at 1 a.m. to tell me the story of their life. Especially after snubbing my natural curiosity for weeks as you have done! I’m not accustomed to being snubbed. It’s been quite a pleasing novelty. Sit down on the sofa and unburden your soul.” I told her the whole story. It took some time as I was conscientious over all the details. She gave a deep sigh when I had finished, but she did not say at all what I had expected her to say. Instead she looked at me, laughed a little and said: “Do you know, Anne, you’re a"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,4,"very unusual girl? Haven’t you ever had qualms?” “Qualms?” I asked, puzzled. “Yes, qualms, qualms, qualms! Starting off alone with practically no money. What will you do when you find yourself in a strange country with all your money gone?” “It’s no good bothering about that until it comes. I’ve got plenty of money still. The twenty-five pounds that Mrs. Flemming gave me is practically intact, and then I won the sweep yesterday. That’s another fifteen pounds. Why, I’ve got _lots_ of money. Forty pounds!” “Lots of money! My God!” murmured Mrs. Blair. _“I_ couldn’t do it, Anne, and I’ve plenty of pluck in my own way. I couldn’t start off gaily with a few pounds in my pocket and no idea as to what I was doing and where I was going.” “But that’s the fun of it,” I cried, thoroughly roused. “It gives one such a splendid feeling of adventure.” She looked at me, nodded once or twice, and then smiled. “Lucky Anne! There aren’t many people in the world who feel as you do.” “Well,” I said impatiently, “what do you think of it all, Mrs. Blair?” “I think it’s the most thrilling thing I ever heard! Now, to begin with, you will stop calling me Mrs. Blair. Suzanne will be ever so much better. Is that agreed?” “I should love it, Suzanne.” “Good"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,5,"girl. Now let’s get down to business. You say that in Sir Eustace’s secretary—not that long-faced Pagett, the other one—you recognized the man who was stabbed and came into your cabin for shelter?” I nodded. “That gives us two links connecting Sir Eustace with the tangle. The woman was murdered in _his_ house, and it’s _his_ secretary who gets stabbed at the mystic hour of one o’clock. I don’t suspect Sir Eustace himself, but it can’t be all coincidence. There’s a connection somewhere even if he himself is unaware of it.” “Then there’s the queer business of the stewardess,” she continued thoughtfully. “What was she like?” “I hardly noticed her. I was so excited and strung up—and a stewardess seemed such an anticlimax. But—yes—I did think her face was familiar. Of course it would be if I’d seen her about the ship.” “Her face seemed familiar to you,” said Suzanne. “Sure she wasn’t a man?” “She was very tall,” I admitted. “Hum. Hardly Sir Eustace, I should think, nor Mr. Pagett——Wait!” She caught up a scrap of paper and began drawing feverishly. She inspected the result with her head poised on one side. “A very good likeness of the Rev. Edward Chichester. Now for the etceteras.” She passed the paper over to me. “Is that your stewardess?” “Why, yes,” I cried. “Suzanne, how clever of you!” She"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,6,"disdained the compliment with a light gesture. “I’ve always had suspicions of that Chichester creature. Do you remember how he dropped his coffee-cup and turned a sickly green when we were discussing Crippen the other day?” “And he tried to get Cabin 17!” “Yes, it all fits in so far. But what does it all _mean?_ What was really meant to happen at one o’clock in Cabin 17? It can’t be the stabbing of the secretary. There would be no point in timing that for a special hour on a special day in a special place. No, it must have been some kind of appointment and he was on his way to keep it when they knifed him. But who was the appointment with? Certainly not with you. It might have been with Chichester. Or it might have been with Pagett.” “That seems unlikely,” I objected, “they can see each other any time.” We both sat silent for a minute or two, then Suzanne started off on another tack. “Could there have been anything hidden in the cabin?” “That seems more probable,” I agreed. “It would explain my things being ransacked the next morning. But there was nothing hidden there, I’m sure of it.” “The young man couldn’t have slipped something into a drawer the night before?” I shook my head. “I should have seen him.” “Could"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,7,"it have been your precious piece of paper they were looking for?” “It might have been, but it seems rather senseless. It was only a time and a date—and they were both past by then.” Suzanne nodded. “That’s so of course. No, it wasn’t the paper. By the way, have you got it with you? I’d rather like to see it.” I had brought the paper with me as Exhibit A, and I handed it over to her. She scrutinized it, frowning. “There’s a dot after the 17. Why isn’t there a dot after the 1 too?” “There’s a space,” I pointed out. “Yes, there’s a space, but——” Suddenly she rose and peered at the paper, holding it as close under the light as possible. There was a repressed excitement in her manner. “Anne, that isn’t a dot! That’s a flaw in the paper! A flaw in the paper, you see? So you’ve got to ignore it, and just go by the spaces—the spaces!” I had risen and was standing by her. I read out the figures as I now saw them. “1 71 22.” “You see,” said Suzanne, “it’s the same, but not quite. It’s one o’clock still, and the 22nd—but it’s Cabin 71! _My_ cabin, Anne!” We stood staring at each other, so pleased with our new discovery and so rapt with excitement that you"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,8,"might have thought we had solved the whole mystery. Then I fell to earth with a bump. “But, Suzanne, nothing happened here at one o’clock on the 22nd?” Her face fell also. “No—it didn’t.” Another idea struck me. “This isn’t your own cabin, is it, Suzanne? I mean not the one you originally booked?” “No, the purser changed me into it.” “I wonder if it was booked before sailing for some one—some one who didn’t turn up. I suppose we could find out.” “We don’t need to find out, Gipsy girl,” cried Suzanne. “I know! The purser was telling me about it. The cabin was booked in the name of Mrs. Grey—but it seems that Mrs. Grey was merely a pseudonym for the famous Madame Nadina. She’s a celebrated Russian dancer, you know. She’s never appeared in London, but Paris has been quite mad about her. She had a terrific success there all through the War. A thoroughly bad lot, I believe, but most attractive. The purser expressed his regrets that she wasn’t on board in a most heart-felt fashion when he gave me her cabin, and then Colonel Race told me a lot about her. It seems there were very queer stories afloat in Paris. She was suspected of espionage, but they couldn’t prove anything. I rather fancy Colonel Race was over there simply on"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,9,"that account. He’s told me some very interesting things. There was a regular organized gang, not German in origin at all. In fact the head of it, a man always referred to as ‘the Colonel’ was thought to be an Englishman, but they never got any clue as to his identity. But there is no doubt that he controlled a considerable organization of international crooks. Robberies, espionages, assaults, he undertook them all—and usually provided an innocent scapegoat to pay the penalty. Diabolically clever, he must have been! This woman was supposed to be one of his agents, but they couldn’t get hold of anything to go upon. Yes, Anne, we’re on the right tack. Nadina is just the woman to be mixed up in this business. The appointment on the morning of the 22nd was with her in this cabin. But where is she? Why didn’t she sail?” A light flashed upon me. “She meant to sail,” I said slowly. “Then why didn’t she?” _“Because she was dead._ Suzanne, Nadina was the woman murdered at Marlow!” My mind went back to the bare room in the empty house, and there swept over me again that indefinable sensation of menace and evil. With it came the memory of the falling pencil and the discovery of the roll of films. A roll of films—that struck a more recent"
3,The Missing Will,16,CHAPTER XIV,10,"note. Where had I heard of a roll of films? And why did I connect that thought with Mrs. Blair? Suddenly I flew at her and almost shook her in my excitement. “Your films! The ones that were passed to you through the ventilator? Wasn’t that on the 22nd?” “The ones I lost?” “How do you know they were the same? Why would any one return them to you that way—in the middle of the night? It’s a mad idea. No—they were a message, the films had been taken out of the yellow tin case, and something else put inside. Have you got it still?” “I may have used it. No, here it is. I remember I tossed it into the rack at the side of the bunk.” She held it out to me. It was an ordinary round tin cylinder, such as films are packed in for the tropics. I took it with trembling hand, but even as I did so my heart leapt. It was noticeably heavier than it should have been. With shaking fingers I peeled off the strip of adhesive plaster that kept it air-tight. I pulled off the lid, and a stream of dull glassy pebbles rolled onto the bed. “Pebbles,” I said, keenly disappointed. “Pebbles?” cried Suzanne. The ring in her voice excited me. “Pebbles? No, Anne, not pebbles! _Diamonds!_”"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,1,"Diamonds! I stared, fascinated, at the glassy heap on the bunk. I picked up one which, but for the weight, might have been a fragment of broken bottle. “Are you sure, Suzanne?” “Oh, yes, my dear. I’ve seen rough diamonds too often to have any doubts. They’re beauties too, Anne—and some of them are unique, I should say. There’s a history behind these.” “The history we heard to-night,” I cried. “You mean——?” “Colonel Race’s story. It can’t be a coincidence. He told it for a purpose.” “To see its effect, you mean?” I nodded. “Its effect on Sir Eustace?” “Yes.” But, even as I said it, a doubt assailed me. _Was_ it Sir Eustace who had been subjected to a test, or had the story been told for _my_ benefit? I remembered the impression I had received on that former night of having been deliberately “pumped.” For some reason or other, Colonel Race was suspicious. But where did he come in? What possible connection could he have"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,2,"with the affair? “Who _is_ Colonel Race?” I asked. “That’s rather a question,” said Suzanne. “He’s pretty well known as a big-game hunter, and, as you heard him say to-night, he was a distant cousin of Sir Laurence Eardsley. I’ve never actually met him until this trip. He journeys to and from Africa a good deal. There’s a general idea that he does Secret Service work. I don’t know whether it’s true or not. He’s certainly rather a mysterious creature.” “I suppose he came into a lot of money as Sir Laurence Eardsley’s heir?” “My dear Anne, he must be _rolling._ You know, he’d be a splendid match for you.” “I can’t have a good go at him with you aboard the ship,” I said, laughing. “Oh, these married women!” “We do have a pull,” murmured Suzanne complacently. “And everybody knows that I am absolutely devoted to Clarence—my husband, you know. It’s so safe and pleasant to make love to a devoted wife.” “It must be"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,3,"very nice for Clarence to be married to some one like you.” “Well, I’m wearing to live with! Still, he can always escape to the Foreign Office, where he fixes his eyeglass in his eye, and goes to sleep in a big arm-chair. We might cable him to tell us all he knows about Race. I love sending cables. And they annoy Clarence so. He always says a letter would have done as well. I don’t suppose he’d tell us anything, though. He is so frightfully discreet. That’s what makes him so hard to live with for long on end. But let us go on with our matchmaking. I’m sure Colonel Race is very attracted to you, Anne. Give him a couple of glances from those wicked eyes of yours, and the deed is done. Every one gets engaged on board ship. There’s nothing else to do.” “I don’t want to get married.” “Don’t you?” said Suzanne. “Why not? I love being married—even to Clarence!” I"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,4,"disdained her flippancy. “What I want to know is,” I said with determination, “what has Colonel Race got to do with this? He’s in it somewhere.” “You don’t think it was mere chance, his telling that story?” “No, I don’t,” I said decidedly. “He was watching us all narrowly. You remember, _some_ of the diamonds were recovered, not all. Perhaps these are the missing ones—or perhaps——” “Perhaps what?” I did not answer directly. “I should like to know,” I said, “what became of the other young man. Not Eardsley but—what was his name?—Lucas!” “We’re getting some light on the thing, anyway. It’s the diamonds all these people are after. It must have been to obtain possession of the diamonds that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ killed Nadina.” “He didn’t kill her,” I said sharply. “Of course he killed her. Who else could have done so?” “I don’t know. But I’m sure he didn’t kill her.” “He went into that house three minutes after her and"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,5,"came out as white as a sheet.” “Because he found her dead.” “But nobody else went in.” “Then the murderer was in the house already, or else he got in some other way. There’s no need for him to pass the lodge, he could have climbed over the wall.” Suzanne glanced at me sharply. “‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’” she mused. “Who was he, I wonder? Anyway, he was identical with the ‘doctor’ in the Tube. He would have had time to remove his make-up and follow the woman to Marlow. She and Carton were to have met there, they both had an order to view the same house, and if they took such elaborate precautions to make their meeting appear accidental they must have suspected they were being followed. All the same, Carton did _not_ know that his shadower was the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ When he recognized him, the shock was so great that he lost his head completely and stepped back"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,6,"onto the line. That all seems pretty clear, don’t you think so, Anne?” I did not reply. “Yes, that’s how it was. He took the paper from the dead man, and in his hurry to get away he dropped it. Then he followed the woman to Marlow. What did he do when he left there, when he had killed her—or, according to you, found her dead. Where did he go?” Still I said nothing. “I wonder, now,” said Suzanne musingly. “Is it possible that he induced Sir Eustace Pedler to bring him on board as his secretary? It would be a unique chance of getting safely out of England, and dodging the hue and cry. But how did he square Sir Eustace? It looks as though he had some hold over him.” “Or over Pagett,” I suggested in spite of myself. “You don’t seem to like Pagett, Anne. Sir Eustace says he’s a most capable and hard-working young man. And, really, he may be for all"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,7,"we know against him. Well, to continue my surmises. Rayburn is the ‘Man in the Brown Suit.’ He had read the paper he dropped. Therefore, misled by the dot as you were, he attempts to reach Cabin 17 at one o’clock on the 22nd, having previously tried to get possession of the cabin through Pagett. On the way there somebody knifes him——” “Who?” I interpolated. “Chichester. Yes, it all fits in. Cable to Lord Nasby that you have found ‘The Man in the Brown Suit,’ and your fortune’s made, Anne!” “There are several things you’ve overlooked.” “What things? Rayburn’s got a scar, I know—but a scar can be faked easily enough. He’s the right height and build. What’s the description of a head with which you pulverized them at Scotland Yard?” I trembled. Suzanne was a well-educated, well-read woman, but I prayed that she might not be conversant with technical terms of anthropology. “Dolichocephalic,” I said lightly. Suzanne looked doubtful. “Was that it?” “Yes. Long-headed, you"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,8,"know. A head whose width is less than 75 per cent. of its length,” I explained fluently. There was a pause. I was just beginning to breathe freely when Suzanne said suddenly: “What’s the opposite?” “What do you mean—the opposite?” “Well, there must be an opposite. What do you call the heads whose breadth is more than 75 per cent. of their length.” “Brachycephalic,” I murmured unwillingly. “That’s it. I thought that was what you said.” “Did I? It was a slip of the tongue. I meant dolichocephalic,” I said with all the assurance I could muster. Suzanne looked at me searchingly. Then she laughed. “You lie very well, Gipsy girl. But it will save time and trouble now if you tell me all about it.” “There’s nothing to tell,” I said unwillingly. “Isn’t there?” said Suzanne gently. “I suppose I shall have to tell you,” I said slowly. “I’m not ashamed of it. You can’t be ashamed of something that just—happens to you. That’s what"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,9,"he did. He was detestable—rude and ungrateful—but that I think I understand. It’s like a dog that’s been chained up—or badly treated—it’ll bite anybody. That’s what he was like—bitter and snarling. I don’t know why I care—but I do. I care horribly. Just seeing him has turned my whole life upside-down. I love him. I want him. I’ll walk all over Africa barefoot till I find him, and I’ll make him care for me. I’d die for him. I’d work for him, slave for him, steal for him, even beg or borrow for him! There—now you know!” Suzanne looked at me for a long time. “You’re very un-English, Gipsy girl,” she said at last. “There’s not a scrap of the sentimental about you. I’ve never met any one who was at once so practical and so passionate. I shall never care for any one like that—mercifully for me—and yet—and yet I envy you, Gipsy girl. It’s something to be able to care. Most people can’t. But"
3,The Missing Will,17,CHAPTER XV,10,"what a mercy for your little doctor man that you didn’t marry him. He doesn’t sound at all the sort of individual who would enjoy keeping high explosive in the house! So there’s to be no cabling to Lord Nasby?” I shook my head. “And yet you believe him to be innocent?” “I also believe that innocent people can be hanged.” “Hm! yes. But, Anne dear, you can face facts, face them now. In spite of all you say, he may have murdered this woman.” “No,” I said. “He didn’t.” “That’s sentiment.” “No, it isn’t. He might have killed her. He may even have followed her there with that idea in his mind. But he wouldn’t take a bit of black cord and strangle her with it. If he’d done it, he would have strangled her with his bare hands.” Suzanne gave a little shiver. Her eyes narrowed appreciatively. “Hm! Anne, I am beginning to see why you find this young man of yours so attractive!”"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,1,"I got an opportunity of tackling Colonel Race on the following morning. The auction of the sweep had just been concluded, and we walked up and down the deck together. “How’s the gipsy this morning? Longing for land and her caravan?” I shook my head. “Now that the sea is behaving so nicely, I feel I should like to stay on it for ever and ever.” “What enthusiasm!” “Well, isn’t it lovely this morning?” We leant together over the rail. It was a glassy calm. The sea looked as though it had been oiled. There were great patches of colour on it, blue, pale green, emerald, purple and deep orange, like a cubist picture. There was an occasional flash of silver that showed the flying fish. The air was moist and warm, almost sticky. Its breath was like a perfumed caress. “That was a very interesting story you told us last night,” I said, breaking the silence. “Which one?” “The one about the diamonds.” “I believe women are always interested in diamonds.” “Of course we are. By the way, what became of the other young man? You said there were two of them.” “Young Lucas? Well, of course, they couldn’t prosecute one without the other, so he went scot-free too.” “And what happened to him—eventually, I mean. Does any one know?” Colonel Race was looking straight ahead of him out to sea. His face was as devoid of expression as a mask, but I had an idea that he did not like my questions. Nevertheless, he replied readily enough: “He went to the War and acquitted himself bravely. He was reported Missing and Wounded—believed killed.” That told me what I wanted to know. I asked no more. But more"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,2,"than ever I wondered how much Colonel Race knew. The part he was playing in all this puzzled me. One other thing I did. That was to interview the night steward. With a little financial encouragement, I soon got him to talk. “The lady wasn’t frightened, was she, miss? It seemed a harmless sort of joke. A bet, or so I understood.” I got it all out of him, little by little. On the voyage from Cape Town to England one of the passengers had handed him a roll of films with instructions that they were to be dropped onto the bunk in Cabin 71 at 1 a.m. on January 22nd on the outward journey. A lady would be occupying the cabin, and the affair was described as a bet. I gathered that the steward had been liberally paid for his part in the transaction. The lady’s name had not been mentioned. Of course, as Mrs. Blair went straight into Cabin 71, interviewing the purser as soon as she got on board, it never occurred to the steward that she was not the lady in question. The name of the passenger who had arranged the transaction was Carton, and his description tallied exactly with that of the man killed on the Tube. So one mystery, at all events, was cleared up, and the diamonds were obviously the key to the whole situation. Those last days on the _Kilmorden_ seemed to pass very quickly. As we drew nearer and nearer to Cape Town, I was forced to consider carefully my future plans. There were so many people I wanted to keep an eye on. Mr. Chichester, Sir Eustace and his secretary, and—yes, Colonel Race! What was I to do about"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,3,"it? Naturally it was Chichester who had first claim on my attention. Indeed, I was on the point of reluctantly dismissing Sir Eustace and Mr. Pagett from their position of suspicious characters, when a chance conversation awakened fresh doubts in my mind. I had not forgotten Mr. Pagett’s incomprehensible emotion at the mention of Florence. On the last evening on board we were all sitting on deck and Sir Eustace addressed a perfectly innocent question to his secretary. I forget exactly what it was, something to do with railway delays in Italy, but at once I noticed that Mr. Pagett was displaying the same uneasiness which had caught my attention before. When Sir Eustace claimed Mrs. Blair for a dance, I quickly moved into the chair next to the secretary. I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. “I have always longed to go to Italy,” I said. “And especially to Florence. Didn’t you enjoy it very much there?” “Indeed I did, Miss Beddingfeld. If you will excuse me, there is some correspondence of Sir Eustace’s that——” I took hold of him firmly by his coat sleeve. “Oh, you mustn’t run away!” I cried with the skittish accent of an elderly dowager. “I’m sure Sir Eustace wouldn’t like you to leave me alone with no one to talk to. You never seem to want to talk about Florence. Oh, Mr. Pagett, I believe you have a guilty secret!” I still had my hand on his arm, and I could feel the sudden start he gave. “Not at all, Miss Beddingfeld, not at all,” he said earnestly. “I should be only too delighted to tell you all about it, but there really are some cables——” “Oh, Mr."
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,4,"Pagett, what a thin pretence. I shall tell Sir Eustace——” I got no further. He gave another jump. The man’s nerves seemed in a shocking state. “What is it you want to know?” The resigned martyrdom of his tone made me smile inwardly. “Oh, everything! The pictures, the olive trees——” I paused, rather at a loss myself. “I suppose you speak Italian?” I resumed. “Not a word, unfortunately. But of course, with hall porters and—er—guides.” “Exactly,” I hastened to reply. “And which was your favourite picture?” “Oh, er—the Madonna—er—Raphael, you know.” “Dear old Florence,” I murmured sentimentally. “So picturesque on the banks of the Arno. A beautiful river. And the Duomo, you remember the Duomo?” “Of course, of course.” “Another beautiful river, is it not?” I hazarded. “Almost more beautiful than the Arno?” “Decidedly so, I should say.” Emboldened by the success of my little trap, I proceeded further. But there was little room for doubt. Mr. Pagett delivered himself into my hands with every word he uttered. The man had never been in Florence in his life. But, if not in Florence, where had he been? In England? Actually in England at the time of the Mill House Mystery? I decided on a bold step. “The curious thing is,” I said, “that I fancied I had seen you before somewhere. But I must be mistaken—since you were in Florence at the time. And yet——” I studied him frankly. There was a hunted look in his eyes. He passed his tongue over his dry lips. “Where—er—where——” “—did I think I had seen you?” I finished for him. “At Marlow. You know Marlow? Why, of course, how stupid of me, Sir Eustace has a house there!” But with an incoherent"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,5,"muttered excuse, my victim rose and fled. That night I invaded Suzanne’s cabin, alight with excitement. “You see, Suzanne,” I urged, as I finished my tale, “he was in England, in Marlow, at the time of the murder. Are you so sure now that ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is guilty.” “I’m sure of one thing,” said Suzanne, twinkling unexpectedly. “What’s that?” “That ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’ is better looking than poor Mr. Pagett. No, Anne, don’t get cross. I was only teasing. Sit down here. Joking apart, I think you’ve made a very important discovery. Up till now, we’ve considered Pagett as having an alibi. Now we know he hasn’t.” “Exactly,” I said. “We must keep an eye on him.” “As well as everybody else,” she said ruefully. “Well, that’s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. That—and finance. No, don’t stick your nose in the air. I know you are absurdly proud and independent, but you’ve got to listen to horse sense over this. We’re partners—I wouldn’t offer you a penny because I liked you, or because you’re a friendless girl—what I want is a thrill, and I’m prepared to pay for it. We’re going into this together regardless of expense. To begin with you’ll come with me to the Mount Nelson Hotel at my expense, and we’ll plan out our campaign.” We argued the point. In the end I gave in. But I didn’t like it. I wanted to do the thing on my own. “That’s settled,” said Suzanne at last, getting up and stretching herself with a big yawn. “I’m exhausted with my own eloquence. Now then, let us discuss our victims. Mr. Chichester is going on to"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,6,"Durban. Sir Eustace is going to the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape Town and then up to Rhodesia. He’s going to have a private car on the railway, and in a moment of expansion, after his fourth glass of champagne the other night, he offered me a place in it. I dare say he didn’t really mean it, but, all the same, he can’t very well back out if I hold him to it.” “Good,” I approved. “You keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Pagett, and I take on Chichester. But what about Colonel Race?” Suzanne looked at me queerly. “Anne, you can’t possibly suspect——” “I do. I suspect everybody. I’m in the mood when one looks round for the most unlikely person.” “Colonel Race is going to Rhodesia too,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “If we could arrange for Sir Eustace to invite him also——” “You can manage it. You can manage anything.” “I love butter,” purred Suzanne. We parted on the understanding that Suzanne should employ her talents to the best advantage. I felt too excited to go to bed immediately. It was my last night on board. Early to-morrow morning we should be in Table Bay. I slipped up on deck. The breeze was fresh and cool. The boat was rolling a little in the choppy sea. The decks were dark and deserted. It was after midnight. I leaned over the rail, watching the phosphorescent trail of foam. Ahead of us lay Africa, we were rushing towards it through the dark water. I felt alone in a wonderful world. Wrapped in a strange peace, I stood there, taking no heed of time, lost in a dream. And suddenly I had a curious intimate premonition of danger. I"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,7,"had heard nothing, but I swung round instinctively. A shadowy form had crept up behind me. As I turned, it sprang. One hand gripped my throat, stifling any cry I might have uttered. I fought desperately, but I had no chance. I was half choking from the grip on my throat, but I bit and clung and scratched in the most approved feminine fashion. The man was handicapped by having to keep me from crying out. If he had succeeded in reaching me unawares it would have been easy enough for him to sling me overboard with a sudden heave. The sharks would have taken care of the rest. Struggle as I would, I felt myself weakening. My assailant felt it too. He put out all his strength. And then, running on swift noiseless feet, another shadow joined in. With one blow of his fist, he sent my opponent crashing headlong to the deck. Released, I fell back against the rail, sick and trembling. My rescuer turned to me with a quick movement. “You’re hurt!” There was something savage in his tone—a menace against the person who had dared to hurt me. Even before he spoke I had recognized him. It was my man—the man with the scar. But that one moment in which his attention had been diverted to me had been enough for the fallen enemy. Quick as a flash he had risen to his feet and taken to his heels down the deck. With an oath Rayburn sprang after him. I always hate being out of things. I joined the chase—a bad third. Round the deck we went to the starboard side of the ship. There by the saloon door lay the man in a crumpled"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,8,"heap. Rayburn was bending over him. “Did you hit him again?” I called breathlessly. “There was no need,” he replied grimly. “I found him collapsed by the door. Or else he couldn’t get it open and is shamming. We’ll soon see about that. And we’ll see who he is too.” With a beating heart I drew near. I had realized at once that my assailant was a bigger man than Chichester. Anyway, Chichester was a flabby creature who might use a knife at a pinch, but who would have little strength in his bare hands. Rayburn struck a match. We both uttered an ejaculation. The man was Guy Pagett. Rayburn appeared absolutely stupefied by the discovery. “Pagett,” he muttered. “My God, Pagett.” I felt a slight sense of superiority. “You seem surprised.” “I am,” he said heavily. “I never suspected——” He wheeled suddenly round on me. “And you? You’re not? You recognized him, I suppose, when he attacked you?” “No, I didn’t. All the same, I’m not so very surprised.” He stared at me suspiciously. “Where do you come in, I wonder? And how much do you know?” I smiled. “A good deal, Mr.—er—Lucas!” He caught my arm, the unconscious strength of his grip made me wince. “Where did you get that name?” he asked hoarsely. “Isn’t it yours?” I demanded sweetly. “Or do you prefer to be called ‘The Man in the Brown Suit’?” That did stagger him. He released my arm and fell back a pace or two. “Are you a girl or a witch?” he breathed. “I’m a friend.” I advanced a step towards him. “I offered you my help once—I offer it again. Will you have it?” The fierceness of his answer took me"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,9,"aback. “No. I’ll have no truck with you or with any woman. Do your damnedest.” As before, my own temper began to rise. “Perhaps,” I said, “you don’t realize how much in my power you are? A word from me to the Captain——” “Say it,” he sneered. Then advancing with a quick step: “And whilst we’re realizing things, my girl, do you realize that you’re in _my_ power this minute? I could take you by the throat like this.” With a swift gesture he suited the action to the word. I felt his two hands clasp my throat and press—ever so little. “Like this—and squeeze the life out of you! And then—like our unconscious friend here, but with more success—fling your dead body to the sharks. What do you say to that?” I said nothing. I laughed. And yet I knew that the danger was real. Just at that moment he hated me. But I knew that I loved the danger, loved the feeling of his hands on my throat. That I would not have exchanged that moment for any other moment in my life. . . . With a short laugh he released me. “What’s your name?” he asked abruptly. “Anne Beddingfeld.” “Does nothing frighten you, Anne Beddingfeld?” “Oh, yes,” I said, with an assumption of coolness I was far from feeling. “Wasps, sarcastic women, very young men, cockroaches, and superior shop assistants.” He gave the same short laugh as before. Then he stirred the unconscious form of Pagett with his feet. “What shall we do with this junk? Throw it overboard?” he asked carelessly. “If you like,” I answered with equal calm. “I admire your whole-hearted, blood-thirsty instincts, Miss Beddingfeld. But we will leave him to"
3,The Missing Will,18,CHAPTER XVI,10,"recover at his leisure. He is not seriously hurt.” “You shrink from a second murder, I see,” I said sweetly. “A second murder?” He looked genuinely puzzled. “The woman at Marlow,” I reminded him, watching the effect of my words closely. An ugly brooding expression settled down on his face. He seemed to have forgotten my presence. “I might have killed her,” he said. “Sometimes I believe that I meant to kill her. . . .” A wild rush of feeling, hatred of the dead woman, surged through me. _I_ could have killed her that moment, had she stood before me. . . . For he must have loved her once—he must—he must—to have felt like that! I regained control of myself and spoke in my normal voice: “We seem to have said all there is to be said—except good night.” “Good night and good-bye, Miss Beddingfeld.” “Au revoir, Mr. Lucas.” Again he flinched at the name. He came nearer. “Why do you say that—au revoir, I mean?” “Because I have a fancy that we shall meet again.” “Not if I can help it!” Emphatic as his tone was, it did not offend me. On the contrary I hugged myself with secret satisfaction. I am not quite a fool. “All the same,” I said gravely, “I think we shall.” “Why?” I shook my head, unable to explain the feeling that had actuated my words. “I never wish to see you again,” he said suddenly and violently. It was really a very rude thing to say, but I only laughed softly and slipped away into the darkness. I heard him start after me, and then pause, and a word floated down the deck. I think it was a “witch”!"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,1,"_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_ Mount Nelson Hotel, Cape Town. It is really the greatest relief to get off the _Kilmorden._ The whole time that I was on board I was conscious of being surrounded by a network of intrigue. To put the lid on everything, Guy Pagett must needs engage in a drunken brawl the last night. It is all very well to explain it away, but that is what it actually amounts to. What else would you think if a man comes to you with a lump the size of an egg on the side of his head and an eye coloured all the tints of the rainbow? Of course Pagett would insist on trying to be mysterious about the whole thing. According to him, you would think his black eye was the direct result of his devotion to my interests. His story was extraordinarily vague and rambling, and it was a long time before I could make head"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,2,"or tail of it. To begin with, it appears he caught sight of a man behaving suspiciously. Those are Pagett’s words. He has taken them straight from the pages of a German Spy Story. What he means by a man behaving suspiciously he doesn’t know himself. I said so to him. “He was slinking along in a very furtive manner, and it was the middle of the night, Sir Eustace.” “Well, what were you doing yourself? Why weren’t you in bed and asleep like a good Christian?” I demanded irritably. “I had been coding those cables of yours, Sir Eustace, and typing the diary up to date.” Trust Pagett to be always in the right and a martyr over it! “Well?” “I just thought I would have a look around before turning in, Sir Eustace. The man was coming down the passage from your cabin. I thought at once there was something wrong by the way he looked about him. He slunk up the"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,3,"stairs by the saloon. I followed him. “My dear Pagett,” I said, “why shouldn’t the poor chap go on deck without having his footsteps dogged? Lots of people even sleep on deck—very uncomfortable, I’ve always thought. The sailors wash you down with the rest of the deck at five in the morning.” I shuddered at the idea. “Anyway,” I continued, “if you went worrying some poor devil who was suffering from insomnia, I don’t wonder he landed you one.” Pagett looked patient. “If you would hear me out, Sir Eustace. I was convinced the man had been prowling about near your cabin where he had no business to be. The only two cabins down that passage are yours and Colonel Race’s.” “Race,” I said, lighting a cigar carefully, “can look after himself without your assistance, Pagett.” I added as an afterthought: “So can I.” Pagett came nearer and breathed heavily as he always does before imparting a secret. “You see, Sir Eustace, I fancied—and"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,4,"now indeed I am sure—it was Rayburn.” “Rayburn?” “Yes, Sir Eustace.” I shook my head. “Rayburn has far too much sense to attempt to wake me up in the middle of the night.” “Quite so, Sir Eustace. I think it was Colonel Race he went to see. A secret meeting—for orders!” “Don’t hiss at me, Pagett,” I said, drawing back a little, “and do control your breathing. Your idea is absurd. Why should they want to have a secret meeting in the middle of the night? If they’d anything to say to each other, they could hob-nob over beef-tea in a perfectly casual and natural manner.” I could see that Pagett was not in the least convinced. _“Something_ was going on last night, Sir Eustace,” he urged, “or why should Rayburn assault me so brutally.” “You’re quite sure it was Rayburn?” Pagett appeared to be perfectly convinced of that. It was the only part of the story that he wasn’t vague about. “There’s something"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,5,"very queer about all this,” he said. “To begin with, where _is_ Rayburn?” It’s perfectly true that we haven’t seen the fellow since we came on shore. He did not come up to the hotel with us. I decline to believe that he is afraid of Pagett, however. Altogether the whole thing is very annoying. One of my secretaries has vanished into the blue, and the other looks like a disreputable prize-fighter. I can’t take him about with me in his present condition. I shall be the laughing-stock of Cape Town. I have an appointment later in the day to deliver old Milray’s _billet-doux,_ but I shall not take Pagett with me. Confound the fellow and his prowling ways. Altogether I am decidedly out of temper. I had poisonous breakfast with poisonous people. Dutch waitresses with thick ankles who took half an hour to bring me a bad bit of fish. And this farce of getting up at 5 a.m. on arrival at the"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,6,"port to see a blinking doctor and hold your hands above your head simply makes me tired. _Later._ A very serious thing has occurred. I went to my appointment with the Prime Minister, taking Milray’s sealed letter. It didn’t look as though it had been tampered with, but inside was a blank sheet of paper! Now, I suppose, I’m in the devil of a mess. Why I ever let that bleating old fool Milray embroil me in the matter I can’t think. Pagett is a famous Job’s comforter. He displays a certain gloomy satisfaction that maddens me. Also, he has taken advantage of my perturbation to saddle me with the stationery trunk. Unless he is careful, the next funeral he attends will be his own. However, in the end I had to listen to him. “Supposing, Sir Eustace, that Rayburn had overheard a word or two of your conversation with Mr. Milray in the street? Remember, you had no written authority from Mr. Milray."
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,7,"You accepted Rayburn on his own valuation.” “You think Rayburn is a crook, then?” I said slowly. Pagett did. How far his views were influenced by resentment over his black eye I don’t know. He made out a pretty fair case against Rayburn. And the appearance of the latter told against him. My idea was to do nothing in the matter. A man who has permitted himself to be made a thorough fool of is not anxious to broadcast the fact. But Pagett, his energy unimpaired by his recent misfortunes, was all for vigorous measures. He had his way of course. He bustled out to the police station, sent innumerable cables, and brought a herd of English and Dutch officials to drink whiskies and sodas at my expense. We got Milray’s answer that evening. He knew nothing of my late secretary! There was only one spot of comfort to be extracted from the situation. “At any rate,” I said to Pagett, “you weren’t poisoned."
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,8,"You had one of your ordinary bilious attacks.” I saw him wince. It was my only score. _Later._ Pagett is in his element. His brain positively scintillates with bright ideas. He will have it now that Rayburn is none other than the famous “Man in the Brown Suit.” I dare say he is right. He usually is. But all this is getting unpleasant. The sooner I get off to Rhodesia the better. I have explained to Pagett that he is not to accompany me. “You see, my dear fellow,” I said, “you must remain here on the spot. You might be required to identify Rayburn any minute. And, besides, I have my dignity as an English Member of Parliament to think of. I can’t go about with a secretary who has apparently recently been indulging in a vulgar street-brawl.” Pagett winced. He is such a respectable fellow that his appearance is pain and tribulation to him. “But what will you do about your"
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,9,"correspondence and the notes for your speeches, Sir Eustace?” “I shall manage,” I said airily. “Your private car is to be attached to the eleven-o’clock train to-morrow, Wednesday, morning,” Pagett continued. “I have made all arrangements. Is Mrs. Blair taking a maid with her?” “Mrs. Blair?” I gasped. “She tells me you offered her a place.” So I did, now I come to think of it. On the night of the Fancy Dress ball. I even urged her to come. But I never thought she would! Delightful as she is, I do not know that I want Mrs. Blair’s society all the way to Rhodesia and back. Women require such a lot of attention. And they are confoundedly in the way sometimes. “Have I asked any one else?” I said nervously. One does these things in moments of expansion. “Mrs. Blair seemed to think you had asked Colonel Race as well.” I groaned. “I must have been very drunk if I asked Race."
3,The Missing Will,19,CHAPTER XVII,10,"Very drunk indeed. Take my advice, Pagett, and let your black eye be a warning to you, don’t go on the bust again.” “As you know, I am a teetotaller, Sir Eustace.” “Much wiser to take the pledge if you have a weakness that way. I haven’t asked any one else, have I, Pagett?” “Not that I know of, Sir Eustace.” I heaved a sigh of relief. “There’s Miss Beddingfeld,” I said thoughtfully. “She wants to get to Rhodesia to dig up bones, I believe. I’ve a good mind to offer her a temporary job as a secretary. She can typewrite, I know, for she told me so.” To my surprise, Pagett opposed the idea vehemently. He does not like Anne Beddingfeld. Ever since the night of the black eye, he has displayed uncontrollable emotion whenever she is mentioned. Pagett is full of mysteries nowadays. Just to annoy him, I shall ask the girl. As I said before, she has extremely nice legs."
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ I don’t suppose that as long as I live I shall forget my first sight of Table Mountain. I got up frightfully early and went out on deck. I went right up to the boat deck, which I believe is a heinous offence, but I decided to dare something in the cause of solitude. We were just steaming into Table Bay. There were fleecy white clouds hovering above Table Mountain, and nestling on the slopes below, right down to the sea, was the sleeping town, gilded and bewitched by the morning sunlight. It made me catch my breath and have that curious hungry pain inside that seizes one sometimes when one comes across something that’s extra beautiful. I’m not very good at expressing these things, but I knew well enough that I had found, if only for a fleeting moment, the thing that I had been looking for ever since I left Little Hampsly. Something new, something hitherto undreamed of, something that satisfied my aching hunger for romance. Perfectly silently, or so it seemed to me, the _Kilmorden_ glided nearer and nearer. It was still very like a dream. Like all dreamers, however, I could not let my dream alone. We poor humans are so anxious not to miss anything. “This is South Africa,” I kept saying to myself industriously, “South Africa, South Africa. You are seeing the"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,2,"world. This is the world. You are seeing it. Think of it, Anne Beddingfeld, you pudding-head. You’re seeing the world.” I had thought that I had the boat deck to myself, but now I observed another figure leaning over the rail, absorbed as I had been in the rapidly approaching city. Even before he turned his head I knew who it was. The scene of last night seemed unreal and melodramatic in the peaceful morning sunlight. What must he have thought of me? It made me hot to realize the things that I had said. And I hadn’t meant them—or had I? I turned my head resolutely away and stared hard at Table Mountain. If Rayburn had come up here to be alone, I, at least, need not disturb him by advertising my presence. But to my intense surprise I heard a light footfall on the deck behind me, and then his voice, pleasant and normal: “Miss Beddingfeld.” “Yes?” I turned. “I want to apologize to you. I behaved like a perfect boor last night.” “It—it was a peculiar night,” I said hastily. It was not a very lucid remark, but it was absolutely the only thing I could think of. “Will you forgive me?” I held out my hand without a word. He took it. “There’s something else I want to say.” His gravity deepened. “Miss Beddingfeld, you may not"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,3,"know it, but you are mixed up in a rather dangerous business.” “I gathered as much,” I said. “No, you don’t. You can’t possibly know. I want to warn you. Leave the whole thing alone. It can’t concern you really. Don’t let your curiosity lead you to tamper with other people’s business. No, please don’t get angry again. I’m not speaking of myself. You’ve no idea of what you might come up against—these men will stop at nothing. They are absolutely ruthless. Already you’re in danger—look at last night. They fancy you know something. Your only chance is to persuade them that they’re mistaken. But be careful, always be on the look out for danger, and, look here, if at any time you should fall into their hands, don’t try and be clever—tell the whole truth, it will be your only chance.” “You make my flesh creep, Mr. Rayburn,” I said, with some truth. “Why do you take the trouble to warn me?” He did not answer for some minutes, then he said in a low voice: “It may be the last thing I can do for you. Once on shore I shall be all right—but I may not get on shore.” “What?” I cried. “You see, I’m afraid you’re not the only person on board who knows that I am ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’” “If you think that"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,4,"I told——” I said hotly. He reassured me with a smile. “I don’t doubt you, Miss Beddingfeld. If I ever said I did, I lied. No, but there’s one person on board who’s known all along. He’s only got to speak—and my number’s up. All the same, I’m taking a sporting chance that he won’t speak.” “Why?” “Because he’s a man who likes playing a lone hand. And when the police have got me I should be of no further use to him. Free, I might be! Well, an hour will show.” He laughed rather mockingly, but I saw his face harden. If he had gambled with Fate, he was a good gambler. He could lose and smile. “In any case,” he said lightly, “I don’t suppose we shall meet again.” “No,” I said slowly. “I suppose not.” “So—good-bye.” “Good-bye.” He gripped my hand hard, just for a minute his curious light eyes seemed to burn into mine, then he turned abruptly and left me. I heard his footsteps ringing along the deck. They echoed and re-echoed. I felt that I should hear them always. Footsteps—going out of my life. I can admit frankly that I did not enjoy the next two hours. Not till I stood on the wharf, having finished with most of the ridiculous formalities that bureaucracies require, did I breathe freely once more. No arrest had been"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,5,"made, and I realized that it was a heavenly day, and that I was extremely hungry. I joined Suzanne. In any case, I was staying the night with her at the hotel. The boat did not go on to Port Elizabeth and Durban until the following morning. We got into a taxi and drove to the Mount Nelson. It was all heavenly. The sun, the air, the flowers! When I thought of Little Hampsly in January, the mud knee-deep, and the sure-to-be-falling rain, I hugged myself with delight. Suzanne was not nearly so enthusiastic. She has travelled a great deal of course. Besides, she is not the type that gets excited before breakfast. She snubbed me severely when I let out an enthusiastic yelp at the sight of a giant blue convolvulus. By the way, I should like to make it clear here and now that this story will not be a story of South Africa. I guarantee no genuine local colour—you know the sort of thing—half a dozen words in italics on every page. I admire it very much, but I can’t do it. In South Sea Islands, of course, you make an immediate reference to _bêche-de-mer._ I don’t know what _bêche-de-mer_ is, I never have known, I probably never shall know. I’ve guessed once or twice and guessed wrong. In South Africa I know you at once begin to"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,6,"talk about a _stoep_—I do know what a _stoep_ is—it’s the thing round a house and you sit on it. In various other parts of the world you call it a veranda, a piazza, and a ha-ha. Then again, there are pawpaws. I had often read of pawpaws. I discovered at once what they were, because I had one plumped down in front of me for breakfast. I thought at first that it was a melon gone bad. The Dutch waitress enlightened me, and persuaded me to use lemon juice and sugar and try again. I was very pleased to meet a pawpaw. I had always vaguely associated it with a _hula-hula,_ which, I believe, though I may be wrong, is a kind of straw skirt that Hawaiian girls dance in. No, I think I am wrong—that is a _lava-lava._ At any rate, all these things are very cheering after England. I can’t help thinking that it would brighten our cold Island life if one could have a breakfast of _bacon-bacon,_ and then go out clad in a _jumper-jumper_ to pay the books. Suzanne was a little tamer after breakfast. They had given me a room next to hers with a lovely view right out over Table Bay. I looked at the view whilst Suzanne hunted for some special face-cream. When she had found it and started an immediate application, she"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,7,"became capable of listening to me. “Did you see Sir Eustace?” I asked. “He was marching out of the breakfast room as we went in. He’d had some bad fish or something and was just telling the head waiter what he thought about it, and he bounced a peach on the floor to show how hard it was—only it wasn’t quite as hard as he thought and it squashed.” Suzanne smiled. “Sir Eustace doesn’t like getting up early any more than I do. But, Anne, did you see Mr. Pagett? I ran against him in the passage. He’s got a black eye. What can he have been doing?” “Only trying to push me overboard,” I replied nonchalantly. It was a distinct score for me. Suzanne left her face half anointed and pressed for details. I gave them to her. “It all gets more and more mysterious,” she cried. “I thought I was going to have the soft job sticking to Sir Eustace, and that you would have all the fun with the Rev. Edward Chichester, but now I’m not so sure. I hope Pagett won’t push me off the train some dark night.” “I think you’re still above suspicion, Suzanne. But, if the worst happens, I’ll wire to Clarence.” “That reminds me—give me a cable form. Let me see now, what shall I say. ‘Implicated in the most thrilling mystery please"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,8,"send me a thousand pounds at once Suzanne.’” I took the form from her, and pointed out that she could eliminate a “the,” an “a,” and possibly, if she didn’t care about being polite, a “please.” Suzanne, however, appears to be perfectly reckless in money matters. Instead of attending to my economical suggestions, she added three words more: “enjoying myself hugely.” Suzanne was engaged to lunch with friends of hers, who came to the hotel about eleven o’clock to fetch her. I was left to my own devices. I went down through the grounds of the hotel, crossed the tram-lines and followed a cool shady avenue right down till I came to the main street. I strolled about, seeing the sights, enjoying the sunlight and the black-faced sellers of flowers and fruits. I also discovered a place where they had the most delicious ice-cream sodas. Finally, I bought a sixpenny basket of peaches and retraced my steps to the hotel. To my surprise and pleasure I found a note awaiting me. It was from the curator of the Museum. He had read of my arrival on the _Kilmorden,_ in which I was described as the daughter of the late Professor Beddingfeld. He had known my father slightly and had had a great admiration for him. He went on to say that his wife would be delighted if I would come out"
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,9,"and have tea with them that afternoon at their Villa at Muizenberg. He gave me instructions for getting there. It was pleasant to think that poor Papa was still remembered and highly thought of. I foresaw that I would have to be personally escorted round the Museum before I left Cape Town, but I risked that. To most people it would have been a treat—but one can have too much of a good thing if one is brought up on it, morning, noon and night. I put on my best hat (one of Suzanne’s cast-offs) and my least crumpled white linen and started off after lunch. I caught a fast train to Muizenberg and got there in about half an hour. It was a nice trip. We wound slowly round the base of Table Mountain, and some of the flowers were lovely. My geography being weak, I had never fully realized that Cape Town is on a peninsula, consequently I was rather surprised on getting out of the train to find myself facing the sea once more. There was some perfectly entrancing bathing going on. The people had short curved boards and came floating in on the waves. It was far too early to go to tea. I made for the bathing pavilion, and when they said would I have a surf board, I said “Yes, please.” Surfing looks perfectly easy."
3,The Missing Will,20,CHAPTER XVIII,10,"_It isn’t._ I say no more. I got very angry and fairly hurled my plank from me. Nevertheless, I determined to return on the first possible opportunity and have another go. I would not be beaten. Quite by mistake I then got a good run on my board, and came out delirious with happiness. Surfing is like that. You are either vigorously cursing or else you are idiotically pleased with yourself. I found the Villa Medgee after some little difficulty. It was right up on the side of the mountain, isolated from the other cottages and villas. I rang the bell, and a smiling Kafir boy answered it. “Mrs. Raffini?” I inquired. He ushered me in, preceded me down the passage and flung open a door. Just as I was about to pass in, I hesitated. I felt a sudden misgiving. I stepped over the threshold and the door swung sharply to behind me. A man rose from his seat behind a table and came forward with outstretched hand. “So glad we have persuaded you to visit us, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said. He was a tall man, obviously a Dutchman, with a flaming orange beard. He did not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, I realized in a flash that I had made a fool of myself. I was in the hands of the enemy."
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,1,"It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.” How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on the screen—you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound to be an Episode IV. But in real life there was absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale. In that moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly. All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell. My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned. “Here you"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,2,"are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously. I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter. “I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum. If I have made a mistake——” “A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!” He laughed coarsely. “What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police——” “Yap, yap, yap—like a little toy dog.” He laughed. I sat down on a chair. “I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said coldly. “Indeed?” “I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?” “So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?” Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances. Should I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace. “Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom I am staying.” “I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.” His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed, but"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,3,"I was not going to give in without a fight. “You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that useful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was going this afternoon.” To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so! “Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising. “What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to appear composed. “Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after you.” For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me. “To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate little fools talk.” It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room into which they had taken me was a kind of attic"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,4,"right under the roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied. The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind him. I was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from crying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below I heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was going out. It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the stiffness and pain were unendurable. It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my head. My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy. Besides being extremely painful,"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,5,"since I could not guard my face with my arms, it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular direction. I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go. In the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It almost touched my bound hands. Even then it was not easy. It took an infinity of time before I could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me. Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect, swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing above all things that I could get hold of something to eat. I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and peeped cautiously out. Everything was"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,6,"still. The moonlight came in through a window and showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down it. Still no sound—but as I stood on the landing below, a faint murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was after midnight. I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower, but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs and stood in the square hall. I looked round me—and then caught my breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he was fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seemed vaguely familiar. In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not distinguish what they said. I applied my"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,7,"eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed, one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting outside my circumscribed range of vision. Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who he was. Mr. Chichester! Now I began to make out the words. “All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after her?” It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized it. “All bluff. They haven’t an idea where she is.” “She spoke very positively.” “I dare say. I’ve looked into the matter, and we’ve nothing to fear. Anyway, it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ orders. You don’t want to go against them, I suppose?” The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it to be a hasty disclaimer. “But why not knock her on the head?” he growled. “It would be simple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?” “Yes,” said Chichester meditatively. “That is what I should do. She knows too much, that is certain. But the ‘Colonel’ is a man who likes to play a lone hand—though no one else must do so.” Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.”"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,8,"He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick to catch him up. “Information?” “Something of the kind.” “Diamonds,” I said to myself. “And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.” For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their checking and counting. “Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to see.” “When do you leave?” “Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.” “Do you want to see the girl before you go?” “No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the ‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?” “I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I think. What about food?” “A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely tied up?” The Dutchman laughed. “What do you think?” They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I beat a hasty retreat. I"
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,9,"was just in time. As I reached the head of the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time the Kafir stirred and moved. My retreat by the way of the hall door was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their heads to come and look at me. They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite see how to manage it. In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all through the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to get out of the house? I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him. I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed to die down."
3,The Missing Will,21,CHAPTER XIX,10,"I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully I crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine. I ran down the drive like one possessed. Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to a garage. I went in. “I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.” I had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the mysterious “Colonel.” Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the _Kilmorden Castle_ was steaming out to sea. And I had no means of knowing whether Chichester had sailed on her or not!"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,1,"I drove to the hotel. There was no one in the lounge that I knew. I ran upstairs and tapped on Suzanne’s door. Her voice bade me “come in.” When she saw who it was she literally fell on my neck. “Anne, dear, where have you been? I’ve been worried to death about you. What have you been doing?” “Having adventures,” I replied. “Episode III of ‘The Perils of Pamela.’” I told her the whole story. She gave vent to a deep sigh when I finished. “Why do these things always happen to you?” she demanded plaintively. “Why does no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?” “You wouldn’t like it if they did,” I assured her. “To tell you the truth, I’m not nearly so keen on having adventures myself as I was. A little of that sort of thing goes a long way.” Suzanne seemed unconvinced. An hour or two of gagging and binding would have changed her views quickly enough. Suzanne likes thrills, but she hates being uncomfortable. “And what are we all doing now?” she asked. “I don’t quite know,” I said thoughtfully. “You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett——” “And you?” That was just my difficulty. Had Chichester gone on the _Kilmorden,_ or had he not? Did he mean to carry out his original plan of going to Durban? The hour of his leaving Muizenberg seemed to point to an affirmative answer to both questions. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancied that I should get there before the boat. On the other hand, if the news of my escape were wired to Chichester, and also the information that I had left Cape Town for Durban, nothing was simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,2,"and so give me the slip completely. It was rather a knotty problem. “We’ll inquire about trains to Durban anyway,” I said. “And it’s not too late for morning tea,” said Suzanne. “We’ll have it in the lounge.” The Durban train left at 8.15 that evening, so they told me at the office. For the moment I postponed decision and joined Suzanne for somewhat belated “eleven-o’clock tea.” “Do you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again—in any other disguise, I mean?” asked Suzanne. I shook my head ruefully. “I certainly didn’t recognize him as the stewardess, and never should have but for your drawing.” “The man’s a professional actor, I’m sure of it,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “His make-up is perfectly marvellous. He might come off the boat as a navvy or something, and you’d never spot him.” “You’re very cheering,” I said. At that minute, Colonel Race stepped in through the window and came and joined us. “What is Sir Eustace doing?” asked Suzanne. “I haven’t seen him about to-day.” Rather an odd expression passed over the Colonel’s face. “He’s got a little trouble of his own to attend to which is keeping him busy.” “Tell us about it.” “I mustn’t tell tales out of school.” “Tell us something—even if you have to invent it for our special benefit.” “Well, what would you say to the famous ‘Man in the Brown Suit’ having made the voyage with us?” _“What?”_ I felt the colour die out of my face and then surge back again. Fortunately Colonel Race was not looking at me. “It’s a fact, I believe. Every port watched for him and he bamboozled Pedler into bringing him out as his secretary!” “Not Mr. Pagett?” “Oh, not Pagett—the other fellow. Rayburn, he called himself.” “Have they arrested him?” asked Suzanne. Under the table she gave my hand a reassuring squeeze."
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,3,"I waited breathlessly for an answer. “He seems to have disappeared into thin air.” “How does Sir Eustace take it?” “Regards it as a personal insult offered him by Fate.” An opportunity of hearing Sir Eustace’s views on the matter presented itself later in the day. We were awakened from a refreshing afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touching terms it requested the pleasure of our company at tea in his sitting-room. The poor man was indeed in a pitiable state. He poured out his troubles to us, encouraged by Suzanne’s sympathetic murmurs. (She does that sort of thing very well.) “First a perfectly strange woman has the impertinence to get herself murdered in my house—on purpose to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house? Why, of all the houses in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm had I ever done the woman that she must needs get herself murdered there?” Suzanne made one of her sympathetic noises again and Sir Eustace proceeded in a still more aggrieved tone. “And, if that’s not enough, the fellow who murdered her has the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me as my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I’m tired of secretaries, I won’t have any more secretaries. Either they’re concealed murderers or else they’re drunken brawlers. Have you seen Pagett’s black eye? But of course you have. How can I go about with a secretary like that? And his face is such a nasty shade of yellow too—just the colour that doesn’t go with a black eye. I’ve done with secretaries—unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eyes, who’ll hold my hand when I’m feeling cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you take on the job?” “How often shall I have to hold your hand?” I asked, laughing. “All day"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,4,"long,” replied Sir Eustace gallantly. “I shan’t get much typing done at that rate,” I reminded him. “That doesn’t matter. All this work is Pagett’s idea. He works me to death. I’m looking forward to leaving him behind in Cape Town.” “He is staying behind?” “Yes, he’ll enjoy himself thoroughly sleuthing about after Rayburn. That’s the sort of thing suits Pagett down to the ground. He adores intrigue. But I’m quite serious in my offer. Will you come? Mrs. Blair here is a competent chaperon, and you can have a half-holiday every now and again to dig for bones.” “Thank you very much, Sir Eustace,” I said cautiously, “but I think I’m leaving for Durban to-night.” “Now don’t be an obstinate girl. Remember, there are lots of lions in Rhodesia. You’ll like lions. All girls do.” “Will they be practising low jumps?” I asked, laughing. “No, thank you very much, but I must go to Durban.” Sir Eustace looked at me, sighed deeply, then opened the door of the adjoining room and called to Pagett. “If you’ve quite finished your afternoon sleep, my dear fellow, perhaps you’d do a little work for change.” Guy Pagett appeared in the doorway. He bowed to us both, starting slightly at the sight of me, and replied in a melancholy voice: “I have been typing that memorandum all this afternoon, Sir Eustace.” “Well, stop typing it then. Go down to the Trade Commissioner’s Office, or the Board of Agriculture, or the Chamber of Mines, or one of these places, and ask them to lend me some kind of a woman to take to Rhodesia. She must have liquid eyes and not object to my holding her hand.” “Yes, Sir Eustace. I will ask for a competent short-hand-typist.” “Pagett’s a malicious fellow,” said Sir Eustace, after the secretary had departed. “I’d be prepared to bet that"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,5,"he’ll pick out some slab-faced creature on purpose to annoy me. She must have nice feet too—I forgot to mention that.” I clutched Suzanne excitedly by the hand and almost dragged her along to her room. “Now, Suzanne,” I said, “we’ve got to make plans—and make them quickly. Pagett is staying behind here—you heard that?” “Yes. I suppose that means that I shan’t be allowed to go to Rhodesia—which is very annoying, because I _want_ to go to Rhodesia. How tiresome.” “Cheer up,” I said. “You’re going all right. I don’t see how you could back out at the last moment without its appearing frightfully suspicious. And, besides, Pagett might suddenly be summoned by Sir Eustace, and it would be far harder for you to attach yourself to him for the journey up.” “It would hardly be respectable,” said Suzanne, dimpling. “I should have to pretend a fatal passion for him as an excuse.” “On the other hand, if you were there when he arrived, it would all be perfectly simple and natural. Besides, I don’t think we ought to lose sight of the other two entirely.” “Oh, Anne, you surely can’t suspect Colonel Race or Sir Eustace?” “I suspect everybody,” I said darkly, “and if you’ve read any detective stories, Suzanne, you must know that it’s always the most unlikely person who’s the villain. Lots of criminals have been cheerful fat men like Sir Eustace.” “Colonel Race isn’t particularly fat—or particularly cheerful either.” “Sometimes they’re lean and saturnine,” I retorted. “I don’t say I seriously suspect either of them, but, after all, the woman was murdered in Sir Eustace’s house——” “Yes, yes, we needn’t go over all that again. I’ll watch him for you, Anne, and if he gets any fatter and any more cheerful, I’ll send you a telegram at once. ‘Sir E. swelling. Highly suspicious. Come at once.’”"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,6,"“Really, Suzanne,” I cried, “you seem to think all this is a game!” “I know I do,” said Suzanne, unabashed. “It seems like that. It’s your fault, Anne. I’ve got imbued with your ‘Let’s have an adventure’ spirit. It doesn’t seem a bit real. Dear me, if Clarence knew that I was running about Africa tracking dangerous criminals, he’d have a fit.” “Why don’t you cable him about it?” I asked sarcastically. Suzanne’s sense of humour always fails her when it comes to sending cables. She considered my suggestion in perfectly good faith. “I might. It would have to be a very long one.” Her eyes brightened at the thought. “But I think it’s better not. Husbands always want to interfere with perfectly harmless amusements.” “Well,” I said, summing up the situation, “you will keep an eye on Sir Eustace and Colonel Race——” “I know why I’ve got to watch Sir Eustace,” interrupted Suzanne, “because of his figure and his humorous conversation. But I think it’s carrying it rather far to suspect Colonel Race, I do indeed. Why, he’s something to do with the Secret Service. Do you know, Anne, I believe the best thing we could do would be to confide in him and tell him the whole story.” I objected vigorously to this unsporting proposal. I recognized in it the disastrous effects of matrimony. How often have I not heard a perfectly intelligent female say, in the tone of one clinching an argument, _“Edgar_ says——” And all the time you are perfectly aware that Edgar is a perfect fool. Suzanne, by reason of her married state, was yearning to lean upon some man or other. However, she promised faithfully that she would not breathe a word to Colonel Race, and we went on with our plan-making. “It’s quite clear that I must stay here and watch Pagett, and this"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,7,"is the best way to do it. I must pretend to leave for Durban this evening, take my luggage down and so on, but really I shall go to some small hotel in the town. I can alter my appearance a little—wear a fair toupee and one of those thick white lace veils, and I shall have a much better chance of seeing what he’s really at if he thinks I’m safely out of the way.” Suzanne approved this plan heartily. We made due and ostentatious preparations, inquiring once more about the departure of the train at the office and packing my luggage. We dined together in the restaurant. Colonel Race did not appear, but Sir Eustace and Pagett were at their table in the window. Pagett left the table half-way through the meal, which annoyed me, as I had planned to say goodbye to him. However, doubtless Sir Eustace would do as well. I went over to him when I had finished. “Good-bye, Sir Eustace,” I said. “I’m off to-night to Durban.” Sir Eustace sighed heavily. “So I heard. You wouldn’t like me to come with you, would you?” “I should love it.” “Nice girl. Sure you won’t change your mind and come and look for lions in Rhodesia?” “Quite sure.” “He must be a very handsome fellow,” said Sir Eustace plaintively. “Some young whipper-snapper in Durban, I suppose, who puts my mature charms completely in the shade. By the way, Pagett’s going down in the car in a minute or two. He could take you to the station.” “Oh, no, thank you,” I said hastily. “Mrs. Blair and I have got our own taxi ordered.” To go down with Guy Pagett was the last thing I wanted! Sir Eustace looked at me attentively. “I don’t believe you like Pagett. I don’t blame you. Of all the officious, interfering asses—going"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,8,"about with the air of a martyr, and doing everything he can to annoy and upset me!” “What has he done now?” I inquired with some curiosity. “He’s got hold of a secretary for me. You never saw such a woman! Forty, if she’s a day, wears pince-nez and sensible boots and an air of brisk efficiency that will be the death of me. A regular slab-faced woman.” “Won’t she hold your hand?” “I devoutly hope not!” exclaimed Sir Eustace. “That would be the last straw. Well, good-bye, liquid eyes. If I shoot a lion I shan’t give you the skin—after the base way you’ve deserted me.” He squeezed my hand warmly and we parted. Suzanne was waiting for me in the hall. She was to come down to see me off. “Let’s start at once,” I said hastily, and motioned to the man to get a taxi. Then a voice behind me made me start: “Excuse me, Miss Beddingfeld, but I’m just going down in a car. I can drop you and Mrs. Blair at the station.” “Oh, thank you,” I said hastily. “But there’s no need to trouble you. I——” “No trouble at all, I assure you. Put the luggage in, porter.” I was helpless. I might have protested further, but a slight warning nudge from Suzanne urged me to be on my guard. “Thank you, Mr. Pagett,” I said coldly. We all got into the car. As we raced down the road into the town, I racked my brains for something to say. In the end Pagett himself broke the silence. “I have secured a very capable secretary for Sir Eustace,” he observed. “Miss Pettigrew.” “He wasn’t exactly raving about her just now,” I remarked. Pagett looked at me coldly. “She is a proficient shorthand-typist,” he said repressively. We pulled up in front of the station. Here"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,9,"surely he would leave us. I turned with outstretched hand—but no. “I’ll come and see you off. It’s just eight o’clock, your train goes in a quarter of an hour.” He gave efficient directions to porters. I stood helpless, not daring to look at Suzanne. The man suspected. He was determined to make sure that I did go by the train. And what could I do? Nothing. I saw myself, in a quarter of an hour’s time, steaming out of the station with Pagett planted on the platform waving me adieu. He had turned the tables on me adroitly. His manner towards me had changed, moreover. It was full of an uneasy geniality which sat ill upon him, and which nauseated me. The man was an oily hypocrite. First he tried to murder me, and now he paid me compliments! Did he imagine for one minute that I hadn’t recognized him that night on the boat? No, it was a pose, a pose which he forced me to acquiesce in, his tongue in his cheek all the while. Helpless as a sheep, I moved along under his expert directions. My luggage was piled in my sleeping compartment—I had a two-berth one to myself. It was twelve minutes past eight. In three minutes the train would start. But Paggett had reckoned without Suzanne. “It will be a terribly hot journey, Anne,” she said suddenly. “Especially going through the Karoo to-morrow. You’ve got some eau-de-Cologne or lavender water with you, haven’t you?” My cue was plain. “Oh, dear,” I cried. “I left my eau-de-Cologne on the dressing-table at the hotel.” Suzanne’s habit of command served her well. She turned imperiously to Pagett. “Mr. Pagett. Quick. You’ve just time. There’s a chemist almost opposite the station. Anne must have some eau-de-Cologne.” He hesitated, but Suzanne’s imperative manner was too much for him. She"
3,The Missing Will,22,CHAPTER XX,10,"is a born autocrat. He went. Suzanne followed him with her eyes till he disappeared. “Quick, Anne, get out the other side—in case he hasn’t really gone, but is watching us from the end of the platform. Never mind your luggage. You can telegraph about that to-morrow. Oh, if only the train starts on time!” I opened the gate on the opposite side to the platform and climbed down. Nobody was observing me. I could just see Suzanne standing where I had left her, looking up at the train and apparently chatting to me at the window. A whistle blew, the train began to draw out. Then I heard feet racing furiously up the platform. I withdrew to the shadow of a friendly bookstall and watched. Suzanne turned from waving her handkerchief to the retreating train. “Too late, Mr. Pagett,” she said cheerfully. “She’s gone. Is that the eau-de-Cologne? What a pity we didn’t think of it sooner!” They passed not far from me on their way out of the station. Guy Pagett was extremely hot. He had evidently run all the way to the chemist and back. “Shall I get you a taxi, Mrs. Blair?” Suzanne did not fail in her rôle. “Yes, please. Can’t I give you a lift back? Have you much to do for Sir Eustace? Dear me, I wish Anne Beddingfeld was coming with us to-morrow. I don’t like the idea of a young girl like that travelling off to Durban all by herself. But she was set upon it. Some little attraction there, I fancy——” They passed out of ear-shot. Clever Suzanne. She had saved me. I allowed a minute or two to elapse and then I too made my way out of the station, almost colliding as I did so with a man—an unpleasant-looking man with a nose disproportionately big for his face."
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,1,"I had no further difficulty in carrying out my plans. I found a small hotel in a back street, got a room there, paid a deposit as I had no luggage with me, and went placidly to bed. On the following morning I was up early and went out into the town to purchase a modest wardrobe. My idea was to do nothing until after the departure of the eleven-o’clock train to Rhodesia with most of the party on board. Pagett was not likely to indulge in any nefarious activities until he had got rid of them. Accordingly I took a tram out of the town and proceeded to enjoy a country walk. It was comparatively cool, and I was glad to stretch my legs after the long voyage and my close confinement at Muizenberg. A lot hinges on small things. My shoe-lace came untied, and I stopped to do it up. The road had just turned a corner, and as I was bending over the offending shoe a man came right round and almost walked into me. He lifted his hat, murmuring an apology, and went on. It struck me at the time that his face was vaguely familiar, but at the moment I thought no more of it. I looked at my wrist-watch. The time was getting on. I turned my feet in the direction of Cape Town."
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,2,"There was a tram on the point of going and I had to run for it. I heard other footsteps running behind me. I swung myself on and so did the other runner. I recognized him at once. It was the man who had passed me on the road when my shoe came untied, and in a flash I knew why his face was familiar. It was the small man with the big nose whom I had run into on leaving the station the night before. The coincidence was rather startling. Could it be possible that the man was deliberately following me? I resolved to test that as promptly as possible. I rang the bell and got off at the next stop. The man did not get off. I withdrew into the shadow of a shop doorway and watched. He alighted at the next stop and walked back in my direction. The case was clear enough. I was being followed. I had crowed too soon. My victory over Guy Pagett took on another aspect. I hailed the next tram and, as I expected, my shadower also got on. I gave myself up to some very serious thinking. It was perfectly apparent that I had stumbled on a bigger thing than I knew. The murder in the house at Marlow was not an isolated incident committed by a solitary individual. I"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,3,"was up against a gang, and, thanks to Colonel Race’s revelations to Suzanne, and what I had overheard at the house at Muizenberg, I was beginning to understand some of its manifold activities. Systematized crime, organized by the man known to his followers as the “Colonel”! I remembered some of the talk I had heard on board ship, of the strike on the Rand and the causes underlying it—and the belief that some secret organization was at work fomenting the agitation. That was the “Colonel’s” work, his emissaries were acting according to plan. He took no part in these things himself, I had always heard, as he limited himself to directing and organizing. The brain-work—not the dangerous labour—for him. But still it well might be that he himself was on the spot, directing affairs from an apparently impeccable position. That, then, was the meaning of Colonel Race’s presence on the _Kilmorden Castle._ He was out after the arch-criminal. Everything fitted in with that assumption. He was some one high up in the Secret Service whose business it was to lay the “Colonel” by the heels. I nodded to myself—things were becoming very clear to me. What of my part in the affair? Where did I come in? Was it only diamonds they were after? I shook my head. Great as the value of the diamonds might be, they hardly accounted"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,4,"for the desperate attempts which had been made to get me out of the way. No, I stood for more than that. In some way, unknown to myself, I was a menace, a danger! Some knowledge that I had, or that they thought I had, made them anxious to remove me at all costs—and that knowledge was bound up somehow with the diamonds. There was one person, I felt sure, who could enlighten me—if he would! The Man in the Brown Suit—Harry Rayburn. He knew the other half of the story. But he had vanished into the darkness, he was a hunted creature flying from pursuit. In all probability he and I would never meet again. . . . I brought myself back with a jerk to the actualities of the moment. It was no good thinking sentimentally of Harry Rayburn. He had displayed the greatest antipathy to me from the first. Or, at least——There I was again—dreaming! The real problem was what to do—_now!_ I, priding myself upon my rôle of watcher, had become the watched. And I was afraid! For the first time I began to lose my nerve. I was the little bit of grit that was impeding the smooth working of the great machine—and I fancied that the machine would have a short way with little bits of grit. Once Harry Rayburn had saved me, once"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,5,"I had saved myself—but I felt suddenly that the odds were heavily against me. My enemies were all around me in every direction, and they were closing in. If I continued to play a lone hand I was doomed. I rallied myself with an effort. After all, what could they do? I was in a civilized city—with policemen every few yards. I would be wary in future. They should not trap me again as they had done in Muizenberg. As I reached this point in my meditations, the train arrived at Adderly Street. I got out. Undecided what to do, I walked slowly up the left-hand side of the street. I did not trouble to look if my watcher was behind me. I knew he was. I walked into Cartwright’s and ordered two coffee ice-cream sodas—to steady my nerves. A man, I suppose, would have had a stiff peg; but girls derive a lot of comfort from ice-cream sodas. I applied myself to the end of the straw with gusto. The cool liquid went trickling down my throat in the most agreeable manner. I pushed the first glass aside empty. I was sitting on one of the little high stools in front of the counter. Out of the tail of my eye, I saw my tracker come in and sit down unostentatiously at a little table near the door. I"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,6,"finished the second coffee soda and demanded a maple one. I can drink practically an unlimited amount of ice-cream sodas. Suddenly the man by the door got up and went out. That surprised me. If he was going to wait outside, why not wait outside from the beginning. I slipped down from my stool and went cautiously to the door. I drew back quickly into the shadow. The man was talking to Guy Pagett. If I had ever had any doubts, that would have settled it. Pagett had his watch out and was looking at it. They exchanged a few brief words, and then the secretary swung on down the street towards the station. Evidently he had given his orders. But what were they? Suddenly my heart leapt into my mouth. The man who had followed me crossed to the middle of the road and spoke to a policeman. He spoke at some length, gesticulating towards Cartwright’s and evidently explaining something. I saw the plan at once. I was to be arrested on some charge or other—pocket-picking, perhaps. It would be easy enough for the gang to put through a simple little matter like that. Of what good to protest my innocence? They would have seen to every detail. Long ago they had brought a charge of robbing De Beers against Harry Rayburn, and he had not been able to"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,7,"disprove it, though I had little doubt but that he had been absolutely blameless. What chance had I against such a “frame up” as the “Colonel” could devise? I glanced up at the clock almost mechanically, and immediately another aspect of the case struck me. I saw the point of Guy Pagett’s looking at his watch. It was just on eleven, and at eleven the mail train left for Rhodesia bearing with it the influential friends who might otherwise come to my rescue. That was the reason of my immunity up to now. From last night till eleven this morning I had been safe, but now the net was closing in upon me. I hurriedly opened my bag and paid for my drinks, and as I did so, my heart seemed to stand still, _for inside it was a man’s wallet stuffed with notes!_ It must have been deftly introduced into my handbag as I left the tram. Promptly I lost my head. I hurried out of Cartwright’s. The little man with the big nose and the policeman were just crossing the road. They saw me, and the little man designated me excitedly to the policeman. I took to my heels and ran. I judged him to be a slow policeman. I should get a start. But I had no plan, even then. I just ran for my life down"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,8,"Adderly Street. People began to stare. I felt that in another minute some one would stop me. An idea flashed into my head. “The station?” I asked, in a breathless gasp. “Just down on the right.” I sped on. It is permissible to run for a train. I turned into the station, but as I did so I heard footsteps close behind me. The little man with the big nose was a champion sprinter. I foresaw that I should be stopped before I got to the platform I was in search of. I looked up to the clock—one minute to eleven. I might just do it if my plan succeeded. I had entered the station by the main entrance in Adderly Street. I now darted out again through the side exit. Directly opposite me was the side entrance to the post office, the main entrance to which is in Adderly Street. As I expected, my pursuer, instead of following me in, ran down the street to cut me off when I emerged by the main entrance, or to warn the policeman to do so. In an instant I slipped across the street again and back into the station. I ran like a lunatic. It was just eleven. The long train was moving as I appeared on the platform. A porter tried to stop me, but I wriggled myself out"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,9,"of his grasp and sprang upon the footboard. I mounted the two steps and opened the gate. I was safe! The train was gathering way. We passed a man standing by himself at the end of the platform. I waved to him. “Good-bye, Mr. Pagett,” I shouted. Never have I seen a man more taken aback. He looked as though he had seen a ghost. In a minute or two I was having trouble with the conductor. But I took a lofty tone. “I am Sir Eustace Pedler’s secretary,” I said haughtily. “Please take me to his private car.” Suzanne and Colonel Race were standing on the rear observation platform. They both uttered an exclamation of utter surprise at seeing me. “Hullo, Miss Anne,” cried Colonel Race, “where have you turned up from? I thought you’d gone to Durban. What an unexpected person you are.” Suzanne said nothing, but her eyes asked a hundred questions. “I must report myself to my chief,” I said demurely. “Where is he?” “He’s in the office—middle compartment—dictating at an incredible rate to the unfortunate Miss Pettigrew.” “This enthusiasm for work is something new,” I commented. “H’m!” said Colonel Race. “His idea is, I think, to give her sufficient work to chain her to her typewriter in her own compartment for the rest of the day.” I laughed. Then, followed by the other two,"
3,The Missing Will,23,CHAPTER XXI,10,"I sought out Sir Eustace. He was striding up and down the circumscribed space, hurling a flood of words at the unfortunate secretary whom I now saw for the first time. A tall, square woman in drab clothing, with pince-nez and an efficient air. I judged that she was finding it difficult to keep pace with Sir Eustace, for her pencil was flying along, and she was frowning horribly. I stepped into the compartment. “Come aboard, sir,” I said saucily. Sir Eustace paused dead in the middle of a complicated sentence on the labour situation and stared at me. Miss Pettigrew must be a nervous creature, in spite of her efficient air, for she jumped as though she had been shot. “God bless my soul!” ejaculated Sir Eustace. “What about the young man in Durban?” “I prefer you,” I said softly. “Darling,” said Sir Eustace. “You can start holding my hand at once.” Miss Pettigrew coughed, and Sir Eustace hastily withdrew his hand. “Ah, yes,” he said. “Let me see, where were we? Yes. Tylman Roos, in his speech at——What’s the matter? Why aren’t you taking it down?” “I think,” said Colonel Race gently, “that Miss Pettigrew has broken her pencil.” He took it from her and sharpened it. Sir Eustace stared, and so did I. There was something in Colonel Race’s tone that I did not quite understand."
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,1,"_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_ I am inclined to abandon my Reminiscences. Instead I shall write a short article entitled “Secretaries I have had.” As regards secretaries, I seem to have fallen under a blight. At one minute I have no secretaries, at another I have too many. At the present minute I am journeying to Rhodesia with a pack of women. Race goes off with the two best-looking, of course, and leaves me with the dud. That is what always happens to me—and, after all, this is _my_ private car, not Race’s. Also Anne Beddingfeld is accompanying me to Rhodesia on the pretext of being my temporary secretary. But all this afternoon she has been out on the observation platform with Race exclaiming at the beauty of the Hex River Pass. It is true that I told her her principal duty would be to hold my hand. But she isn’t even doing that. Perhaps she is"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,2,"afraid of Miss Pettigrew. I don’t blame her if so. There is nothing attractive about Miss Pettigrew—she is a repellent female with large feet, more like a man than a woman. There is something very mysterious about Anne Beddingfeld. She jumped on board the train at the last minute, puffing like a steam-engine for all the world as though she’d been running a race—and yet Pagett told me that he’d seen her off to Durban last night! Either Pagett has been drinking again or else the girl must have an astral body. And she never explains. Nobody ever explains. Yes, “Secretaries I have had.” No. 1, a murderer fleeing from justice. No. 2, a secret drinker who carries on disreputable intrigues in Italy. No. 3, a beautiful girl who possesses the useful faculty of being in two places at once. No. 4, Miss Pettigrew, who, I have no doubt, is really a particularly dangerous crook in disguise! Probably one of"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,3,"Pagett’s Italian friends that he has palmed off on me. I shouldn’t wonder if the world found some day that it had been grossly deceived by Pagett. On the whole, I think Rayburn was the best of the bunch. He never worried me or got in my way. Guy Pagett has had the impertinence to have the stationery trunk put in here. None of us can move without falling over it. I went out on the observation platform just now, expecting my appearance to be greeted with hails of delight. Both the women were listening spellbound to one of Race’s travellers’ tales. I shall label this car—not “Sir Eustace Pedler and Party,” but “Colonel Race and Harem.” Then Mrs. Blair must needs begin taking silly photographs. Every time we went round a particularly appalling curve, as we climbed higher and higher, she snapped at the engine. “You see the point,” she cried delightedly. “It must be some curve if you"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,4,"can photograph the front part of the train from the back, and with the mountain background it will look awfully dangerous.” I pointed out to her that no one could possibly tell it had been taken from the back of the train. She looked at me pityingly. “I shall write underneath it: ‘Taken from the train. Engine going round a curve.’” “You could write that under any snapshot of a train,” I said. Women never think of these simple things. “I’m glad we’ve come up here in daylight,” cried Anne Beddingfeld. “I shouldn’t have seen this if I’d gone last night to Durban, should I?” “No,” said Colonel Race, smiling. “You’d have waked up to-morrow morning to find yourself in the Karoo, a hot, dusty desert of stones and rocks.” “I’m glad I changed my mind,” said Anne, sighing contentedly, and looking round. It was rather a wonderful sight. The great mountains all around, through which we turned and twisted"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,5,"and laboured ever steadily upwards. “Is this the best train in the day to Rhodesia?” asked Anne Beddingfeld. “In the day?” laughed Race. “Why, my dear Miss Anne, there are only three trains a week. Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Do you realize that you don’t arrive at the Falls until Saturday next?” “How well we shall know each other by that time,” said Mrs. Blair maliciously. “How long are you going to stay at the Falls, Sir Eustace?” “That depends,” I said cautiously. “On what?” “On how things go at Johannesburg. My original idea was to stay a couple of days or so at the Falls—which I’ve never seen, though this is my third visit to Africa—and then go on to Jo’burg and study the conditions of things on the Rand. At home, you know, I pose as being an authority on South African politics. But from all I hear, Jo’burg will be a particularly unpleasant place to visit in"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,6,"about a week’s time. I don’t want to study conditions in the midst of a raging revolution.” Race smiled in a rather superior manner. “I think your fears are exaggerated, Sir Eustace. There will be no great danger in Jo’burg.” The women immediately looked at him in the “What a brave hero you are” manner. It annoyed me intensely. I am every bit as brave as Race—but I lack the figure. These long, lean, brown men have it all their own way. “I suppose you’ll be there,” I said coldly. “Very possibly. We might travel together.” “I’m not sure that I shan’t stay on at the Falls a bit,” I answered non-committally. Why is Race so anxious that I should go to Jo’burg? He’s got his eye on Anne, I believe. “What are your plans, Miss Anne?” “That depends,” she replied demurely, copying me. “I thought you were my secretary,” I objected. “Oh, but I’ve been cut out. You’ve been"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,7,"holding Miss Pettigrew’s hand all the afternoon.” “Whatever I’ve been doing, I can swear I’ve not been doing that,” I assured her. _Thursday night._ We have just left Kimberley. Race was made to tell the story of the diamond robbery all over again. Why are women so excited by anything to do with diamonds? At last Anne Beddingfeld has shed her veil of mystery. It seems that she’s a newspaper correspondent. She sent an immense cable from De Aar this morning. To judge by the jabbering that went on nearly all night in Mrs. Blair’s cabin, she must have been reading aloud all her special articles for years to come. It seems that all along she’s been on the track of “The Man in the Brown Suit.” Apparently she didn’t spot him on the _Kilmorden_—in fact, she hardly had the chance, but she’s now very busy cabling home: “How I journeyed out with the Murderer,” and inventing highly fictitious stories"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,8,"of “What he said to me,” etc. I know how these things are done. I do them myself, in my Reminiscences when Pagett will let me. And of course one of Nasby’s efficient staff will brighten up the details still more, so that when it appears in the _Daily Budget_ Rayburn won’t recognize himself. The girl’s clever, though. All on her own, apparently, she’s ferreted out the identity of the woman who was killed in my house. She was a Russian dancer called Nadina. I asked Anne Beddingfeld if she was sure of this. She replied that it was merely a deduction—quite in the Sherlock Holmes manner. However, I gather that she had cabled it home to Nasby as a proved fact. Women have these intuitions—I’ve no doubt that Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly right in her guess—but to call it a deduction is absurd. How she ever got on the staff of the _Daily Budget_ is more than I can"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,9,"imagine. But she is the kind of young woman who does these things. Impossible to withstand her. She is full of coaxing ways that mask an invincible determination. Look how she has got into my private car! I am beginning to have an inkling why. Race said something about the police suspecting that Rayburn would make for Rhodesia. He might just have got off by Monday’s train. They telegraphed all along the line, I presume, and no one of his description was found, but that says little. He’s an astute young man and he knows Africa. He’s probably exquisitely disguised as an old Kafir woman—and the simple police continue to look for a handsome young man with a scar, dressed in the height of European fashion. I never did quite swallow that scar. Anyway, Anne Beddingfeld is on his track. She wants the glory of discovering him for herself and the _Daily Budget._ Young women are very cold-blooded nowadays. I"
3,The Missing Will,24,CHAPTER XXII,10,"hinted to her that it was an unwomanly action. She laughed at me. She assured me that did she run him to earth her fortune was made. Race doesn’t like it, either, I can see. Perhaps Rayburn is on this train. If so, we may all be murdered in our beds. I said so to Mrs. Blair—but she seemed quite to welcome the idea, and remarked that if I were murdered it would be really a terrific scoop for Anne! A scoop for Anne indeed! To-morrow we shall be going through Bechuanaland. The dust will be atrocious. Also at every station, little Kafir children come and sell you quaint wooden animals that they carve themselves. Also mealie bowls and baskets. I am rather afraid that Mrs. Blair may run amok. There is a primitive charm about these toys that I feel will appeal to her. _Friday evening._ As I feared. Mrs. Blair and Anne have bought forty-nine wooden animals!"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ I thoroughly enjoyed the journey up to Rhodesia. There was something new and exciting to see every day. First the wonderful scenery of the Hex river valley, then the desolate grandeur of the Karoo, and finally that wonderful straight stretch of line in Bechuanaland, and the perfectly adorable toys the natives brought to sell. Suzanne and I were nearly left behind at each station—if you could call them stations. It seemed to me that the train just stopped whenever it felt like it, and no sooner had it done so than a horde of natives materialized out of the empty landscape, holding up mealie bowls and sugar canes and fur karosses and adorable carved wooden animals. Suzanne began at once to make a collection of the latter. I imitated her example—most of them cost a “tiki” (threepence) and each was different. There"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,2,"were giraffes and tigers and snakes and a melancholy looking eland and absurd little black warriors. We enjoyed ourselves enormously. Sir Eustace tried to restrain us—but in vain. I still think it was a miracle we were not left behind at some oasis of the line. South African trains don’t hoot or get excited when they are going to start off again. They just glide quietly away, and you look up from your bargaining and run for your life. Suzanne’s amazement at seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town can be imagined. We held an exhaustive survey of the situation on the first evening out. We talked half the night. It had become clear to me that defensive tactics must be adopted as well as aggressive ones. Travelling with Sir Eustace Pedler and his party, I was fairly safe. Both he and Colonel"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,3,"Race were powerful protectors, and I judged that my enemies would not wish to stir up a hornet’s nest about _my_ ears. Also, as long as I was near Sir Eustace, I was more or less in touch with Guy Pagett—and Guy Pagett was the heart of the mystery. I asked Suzanne whether in her opinion it was possible that Pagett himself was the mysterious “Colonel.” His subordinate position was, of course, against the assumption, but it had struck me once or twice that, for all his autocratic ways, Sir Eustace was really very much influenced by his secretary. He was an easy-going man, and one whom an adroit secretary might be able to twist round his little finger. The comparative obscurity of his position might in reality be useful to him, since he would be anxious to be well out of the limelight."
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,4,"Suzanne, however, negatived these ideas very strongly. She refused to believe that Guy Pagett was the ruling spirit. The real head—the “Colonel”—was somewhere in the background and had probably been already in Africa at the time of our arrival. I agreed that there was much to be said for her view, but I was not entirely satisfied. For in each suspicious instance Pagett had been shown as the directing genius. It was true that his personality seemed to lack the assurance and decision that one would expect from a master criminal—but after all, according to Colonel Race, it was brain work only that this mysterious leader supplied, and creative genius is often allied to a weak and timorous physical constitution. “There speaks the Professor’s daughter,” interrupted Suzanne, when I had got to this point in my argument. “It’s true, all the same. On the"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,5,"other hand, Pagett may be the Grand Vizier, so to speak, of the All Highest.” I was silent for a minute or two, and then went on musingly: “I wish I knew how Sir Eustace made his money!” “Suspecting him again?” “Suzanne, I’ve got into that state that I can’t help suspecting somebody! I don’t really suspect him—but, after all, he _is_ Pagett’s employer, and he _did_ own the Mill House.” “I’ve always heard that he made his money in some way he isn’t anxious to talk about,” said Suzanne thoughtfully. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean crime—it might be tin-tacks or hair restorer!” I agreed ruefully. “I suppose,” said Suzanne doubtfully, “that we’re not barking up the wrong tree? Being led completely astray, I mean, by assuming Pagett’s complicity? Supposing that, after all, he is a perfectly honest man?” I considered that for a"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,6,"minute or two, then I shook my head. “I can’t believe that.” “After all, he has his explanations for everything.” “Y—es, but they’re not very convincing. For instance, the night he tried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,_ he says he followed Rayburn up on deck and Rayburn turned and knocked him down. Now we know that’s not true.” “No,” said Suzanne unwillingly. “But we only heard the story at second-hand from Sir Eustace. If we’d heard it direct from Pagett himself, it might have been different. You know how people always get a story a little wrong when they repeat it.” I turned the thing over in my mind. “No,” I said at last, “I don’t see any way out. Pagett’s guilty. You can’t get away from the fact that he tried to throw me overboard, and everything else fits in. Why"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,7,"are you so persistent in this new idea of yours?” “Because of his face?” “His face? But——” “Yes, I know what you’re going to say. It’s a sinister face. That’s just it. No man with a face like that could be really sinister. It must be a colossal joke on the part of Nature.” I did not believe much in Suzanne’s argument. I know a lot about Nature in past ages. If she’s got a sense of humour, she doesn’t show it much. Suzanne is just the sort of person who would clothe Nature with all her own attributes. We passed on to discuss our immediate plans. It was clear to me that I must have some kind of standing. I couldn’t go on avoiding explanations for ever. The solution of all my difficulties lay ready to my hand, though I didn’t think of"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,8,"it for some time. The _Daily Budget!_ My silence or my speech could no longer affect Harry Rayburn. He was marked down as “The Man in the Brown Suit” through no fault of mine. I could help him best by seeming to be against him. The “Colonel” and his gang must have no suspicion that there existed any friendly feeling between me and the man they had elected to be the scapegoat of the murder at Marlow. As far as I knew, the woman killed was still unidentified. I would cable to Lord Nasby, suggesting that she was no other than the famous Russian dancer “Nadina” who had been delighting Paris for so long. It seemed incredible to me that she had not been identified already—but when I learnt more of the case long afterwards I saw how natural it really was. Nadina had"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,9,"never been to England during her successful career in Paris. She was unknown to London audiences. The pictures in the papers of the Marlow victim were so blurred and unrecognizable that it is small wonder no one identified them. And, on the other hand, Nadina had kept her intention of visiting England a profound secret from every one. The day after the murder a letter had been received by her manager purporting to be from the dancer, in which she said that she was returning to Russia on urgent private affairs and that he must deal with her broken contract as best he could. All this, of course, I only learned afterwards. With Suzanne’s full approval, I sent a long cable from De Aar. It arrived at a psychological moment (this again, of course, I learnt afterwards). The _Daily Budget_ was hard up for"
3,The Missing Will,25,CHAPTER XXIII,10,"a sensation. My guess was verified and proved to be correct and the _Daily Budget_ had the scoop of its lifetime. “Victim of the Mill House Murder identified by our special reporter.” And so on. “Our reporter makes voyage with the murderer. ‘The Man in the Brown Suit.’ What he is really like.” The main facts were, of course, cabled to the South African papers, but I only read my own lengthy articles at a much later date! I received approval and full instructions by cable at Bulawayo. I was on the staff of the _Daily Budget,_ and I had a private word of congratulation from Lord Nasby himself. I was definitely accredited to hunt down the murderer, and I, and only I, knew that the murderer was not Harry Rayburn! But let the world think that it was he—best so for the present."
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,1,"We arrived at Bulawayo early on Saturday morning. I was disappointed in the place. It was very hot, and I hated the hotel. Also Sir Eustace was what I can only describe as thoroughly sulky. I think it was all our wooden animals that annoyed him—especially the big giraffe. It was a colossal giraffe with an impossible neck, a mild eye and a dejected tail. It had character. It had charm. A controversy was already arising as to whom it belonged—me or Suzanne. We had each contributed a tiki to its purchase. Suzanne advanced the claims of seniority and the married state, I stuck to the position that I had been the first to behold its beauty. In the meantime, I must admit, it occupied a good deal of this three-dimensional space of ours. To carry forty-nine wooden animals, all of awkward shape, and all of extremely brittle wood, is somewhat of a problem. Two porters were laden with a bunch of animals each—and one promptly dropped a ravishing group of ostriches and broke their heads off. Warned by this, Suzanne and I carried all we could, Colonel Race helped, and I pressed the big giraffe into Sir Eustace’s arms. Even the correct Miss Pettigrew did not escape, a large hippopotamus and two black warriors fell to her share. I had a feeling Miss Pettigrew didn’t like me. Perhaps she fancied I was a bold hussy. Anyway, she avoided me as much as she could. And the funny thing was, her face seemed vaguely familiar to me, though I couldn’t quite place it. We reposed ourselves most of the morning, and in the afternoon we drove out to the Matoppos to see Rhodes’s grave. That is to say, we were to have done so, but at the last moment Sir Eustace backed out. He was very nearly in as bad a temper as the morning we arrived at Cape Town—when he bounced the peaches on the floor and they squashed! Evidently arriving early in the morning at places is bad for his temperament. He cursed the porters, he cursed the waiters at breakfast, he cursed the whole hotel management, he would doubtless have liked to curse Miss Pettigrew who hovered"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,2,"around with her pencil and pad, but I don’t think even Sir Eustace would have dared to curse Miss Pettigrew. She’s just like the efficient secretary in a book. I only rescued our dear giraffe just in time. I feel Sir Eustace would have liked to dash him to the ground. To return to our expedition, after Sir Eustace had backed out, Miss Pettigrew said she would remain at home in case he might want her. And at the very last minute Suzanne sent down a message to say she had a headache. So Colonel Race and I drove off alone. He is a strange man. One doesn’t notice it so much in a crowd. But, when one is alone with him, the sense of his personality seems really almost overpowering. He becomes more taciturn, and yet his silence seems to say more than speech might do. It was so that day that we drove to the Matoppos through the soft yellow brown scrub. Everything seemed strangely silent—except our car which I should think was the first Ford ever made by man! The upholstery of it was torn to ribbons and, though I know nothing about engines, even I could guess that all was not as it should be in its interior. By and by the character of the country changed. Great boulders appeared, piled up into fantastic shapes. I felt suddenly that I had got into a primitive era. Just for a moment Neanderthal men seemed quite as real to me as they had to Papa. I turned to Colonel Race. “There must have been giants once,” I said dreamily. “And their children were just like children are to-day—they played with handfuls of pebbles, piling them up and knocking them down, and the more cleverly they balanced them, the better pleased they were. If I were to give a name to this place I should call it ‘The Country of Giant Children.’” “Perhaps you’re nearer the mark than you know,” said Colonel Race gravely. “Simple, primitive, big—that is Africa.” I nodded appreciatively. “You love it, don’t you?” I asked. “Yes. But to live in it long—well, it makes one what you would call cruel. One comes to hold life"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,3,"and death very lightly.” “Yes,” I said, thinking of Harry Rayburn. He had been like that too. “But not cruel to weak things?” “Opinions differ as to what are and are not ‘weak things,’ Miss Anne.” There was a note of seriousness in his voice which almost startled me. I felt that I knew very little really of this man at my side. “I meant children and dogs, I think.” “I can truthfully say I’ve never been cruel to children or dogs. So you don’t class women as ‘weak things’?” I considered. “No, I don’t think I do—though they are, I suppose. That is, they are nowadays. But Papa always said that in the beginning men and women roamed the world together, equal in strength—like lions and tigers——” “And giraffes?” interpolated Colonel Race slyly. I laughed. Every one makes fun of that giraffe. “And giraffes. They were nomadic, you see. It wasn’t till they settled down in communities, and women did one kind of thing and men another that women got weak. And of course, underneath, one is still the same—one _feels_ the same, I mean, and that is why women worship physical strength in men—it’s what they once had and have lost.” “Almost ancestor worship, in fact?” “Something of the kind.” “And you really think that’s true? That women worship strength, I mean?” “I think it’s quite true—if one’s honest. You think you admire moral qualities, but when you fall in love, you revert to the primitive where the physical is all that counts. But I don’t think that’s the end—if you lived in primitive conditions it would be all right, but you don’t—and so, in the end, the other thing wins after all. It’s the things that are apparently conquered that always do win, isn’t it? They win in the only way that counts. Like what the Bible says about losing your soul and finding it.” “In the end,” said Colonel Race thoughtfully, “you fall in love—and you fall out of it, is that what you mean?” “Not exactly, but you can put it that way if you like.” “But I don’t think you’ve ever fallen out of love, Miss Anne?” “No, I haven’t,” I admitted frankly. “Or"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,4,"fallen in love, either?” I did not answer. The car drew up at our destination and brought the conversation to a close. We got out and began the slow ascent to the World’s View. Not for the first time, I felt a slight discomfort in Colonel Race’s company. He veiled his thoughts so well behind those impenetrable black eyes. He frightened me a little. He had always frightened me. I never knew where I stood with him. We climbed in silence till we reached the spot where Rhodes lies guarded by giant boulders. A strange eerie place, far from the haunts of men, that sings a ceaseless pæan of rugged beauty. We sat there for some time in silence. Then descended once more, but diverging slightly from the path. Sometimes it was a rough scramble and once we came to a sharp slope or rock that was almost sheer. Colonel Race went first, then turned to help me. “Better lift you,” he said suddenly, and swung me off my feet with a quick gesture. I felt the strength of him as he set me down and released his clasp. A man of iron, with muscles like taut steel. And again, I felt afraid, especially as he did not move aside, but stood directly in front of me, staring into my face. “What are you really doing here, Anne Beddingfeld?” he said abruptly. “I’m a gipsy seeing the world.” “Yes, that’s true enough. The newspaper correspondent is only a pretext. You’ve not the soul of the journalist. You’re out for your own hand—snatching at life. But that’s not all.” What was he going to make me tell him? I was afraid—afraid. I looked him full in the face. My eyes can’t keep secrets like his, but they can carry the war into the enemy’s country. “What are _you_ really doing here, Colonel Race?” I asked deliberately. For a moment I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He was clearly taken aback, though. At last he spoke, and his words seemed to afford him a grim amusement. “Pursuing ambition,” he said. “Just that—pursuing ambition. You will remember, Miss Beddingfeld, that ‘by that sin fell the angels,’ etc.” “They say,” I said slowly,"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,5,"“that you are really connected with the Government—that you are in the Secret Service. Is that true?” Was it my fancy, or did he hesitate for a fraction of a second before he answered? “I can assure you, Miss Beddingfeld, that I am out here strictly as a private individual travelling for my own pleasure.” Thinking the answer over later, it struck me as slightly ambiguous. Perhaps he meant it to be so. We rejoined the car in silence. Half-way back to Bulawayo we stopped for tea at a somewhat primitive structure at the side of the road. The proprietor was digging in the garden and seemed annoyed at being disturbed. But he graciously promised to see what he could do. After an interminable wait he brought us some stale cakes and some lukewarm tea. Then he disappeared to his garden again. No sooner had he departed than we were surrounded by cats. Six of them all miaowing piteously at once. The racket was deafening. I offered them some pieces of cake. They devoured them ravenously. I poured all the milk there was into a saucer and they fought each other to get it. “Oh,” I cried indignantly, “they’re starved! It’s wicked. Please, please, order some more milk and another plate of cake.” Colonel Race departed silently to do my bidding. The cats had begun miaowing again. He returned with a big jug of milk and the cats finished it all. I got up with determination on my face. “I’m going to take those cats home with us—I shan’t leave them here.” “My dear child, don’t be absurd. You can’t carry six cats as well as fifty wooden animals round with you.” “Never mind the wooden animals. These cats are alive. I shall take them back with me.” “You will do nothing of the kind.” I looked at him resentfully, but he went on: “You think me cruel—but one can’t go through life sentimentalizing over these things. It’s no good standing out—I shan’t allow you to take them. It’s a primitive country, you know, and I’m stronger than you.” I always know when I am beaten. I went down to the car with tears in my eyes. “They’re probably short"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,6,"of food just to-day,” he explained consolingly. “That man’s wife has gone into Bulawayo for stores. So it will be all right. And anyway, you know, the world’s full of starving cats.” “Don’t—don’t,” I said fiercely. “I’m teaching you to realize life as it is. I’m teaching you to be hard and ruthless—like I am. That’s the secret of strength—and the secret of success.” “I’d sooner be dead than hard,” I said passionately. We got into the car and started off. I pulled myself together again slowly. Suddenly, to my intense astonishment, he took my hand in his. “Anne,” he said gently, “I want you. Will you marry me?” I was utterly taken aback. “Oh, no,” I stammered. “I can’t.” “Why not?” “I don’t care for you in that way. I’ve never thought of you like that.” “I see. Is that the only reason?” I had to be honest. I owed it him. “No,” I said, “it is not. You see—I—care for some one else.” “I see,” he said again. “And was that true at the beginning—when I first saw you—on the _Kilmorden?”_ “No,” I whispered. “It was—since then.” “I see,” he said for the third time, but this time there was a purposeful ring in his voice that made me turn and look at him. His face was grimmer than I had ever seen it. “What—what do you mean?” I faltered. He looked at me, inscrutable, dominating. “Only—that I know now what I have to do.” His words sent a shiver through me. There was a determination behind them that I did not understand—and it frightened me. We neither of us said any more until we got back to the hotel. I went straight up to Suzanne. She was lying on her bed reading, and did not look in the least as though she had a headache. “Here reposes the perfect gooseberry,” she remarked. _“Alias_ the tactful chaperone. Why, Anne dear, what’s the matter?” For I had burst into a flood of tears. I told her about the cats—I felt it wasn’t fair to tell her about Colonel Race. But Suzanne is very sharp. I think she saw that there was something more behind. “You haven’t caught a chill,"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,7,"have you, Anne? Sounds absurd even to suggest such things in this heat, but you keep on shivering.” “It’s nothing,” I said. “Nerves—or some one walking over my grave. I keep feeling something dreadful’s going to happen.” “Don’t be silly,” said Suzanne, with decision. “Let’s talk of something interesting. Anne, about those diamonds——” “What about them?” “I’m not sure they’re safe with me. It was all right before, no one could think they’d be amongst my things. But now that every one knows we’re such friends, you and I, I’ll be under suspicion too.” “Nobody knows they’re in a roll of films, though,” I argued. “It’s a splendid hiding-place and I really don’t think we could better it.” She agreed doubtfully, but said we would discuss it again when we got to the Falls. Our train went at nine o’clock. Sir Eustace’s temper was still far from good, and Miss Pettigrew looked subdued. Colonel Race was completely himself. I felt that I had dreamed the whole conversation on the way back. I slept heavily that night on my hard bunk, struggling with ill-defined, menacing dreams. I awoke with a headache and went out on the observation platform of the car. It was fresh and lovely, and everywhere, as far as one could see, were the undulating wooded hills. I loved it—loved it more than any place I had ever seen. I wished then that I could have a little hut somewhere in the heart of the scrub and live there always—always. . . . Just before half-past two, Colonel Race called me out from the “office” and pointed to a bouquet-shaped white mist that hovered over one portion of the bush. “The spray from the Falls,” he said. “We are nearly there.” I was still wrapped in that strange dream feeling of exaltation that had succeeded my troubled night. Very strongly implanted in me was the feeling that I had come home. . . . Home! And yet I had never been here before—or had I in dreams? We walked from the train to the hotel, a big white building closely wired against mosquitoes. There were no roads, no houses. We went out on the _stoep_ and I uttered a"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,8,"gasp. There, half a mile away, facing us, were the Falls. I’ve never seen anything so grand and beautiful—I never shall. “Anne, you’re fey,” said Suzanne, as we sat down to lunch. “I’ve never seen you like this before.” She stared at me curiously. “Am I?” I laughed, but I felt that my laugh was unnatural. “It’s just that I love it all.” “It’s more than that.” A little frown creased her brow—one of apprehension. Yes, I was happy, but beyond that I had the curious feeling that I was waiting for something—something that would happen soon. I was excited—restless. After tea we strolled out, got on the trolley and were pushed by smiling blacks down the little tracks of rails to the bridge. It was a marvellous sight, the great chasm and the rushing waters below, and the veil of mist and spray in front of us that parted every now and then for one brief minute to show the cataract of water and then closed up again in its impenetrable mystery. That, to my mind, has always been the fascination of the Falls—their elusive quality. You always think you’re going to see—and you never do. We crossed the bridge and walked slowly on by the path that was marked out with white stone on either side and led round the brink of the gorge. Finally we arrived in a big clearing where on the left a path led downwards towards the chasm. “The palm gully,” explained Colonel Race. “Shall we go down? Or shall we leave it until to-morrow? It will take some time, and it’s a good climb up again.” “We’ll leave it until to-morrow,” said Sir Eustace with decision. He isn’t at all fond of strenuous physical exercise, I have noticed. He led the way back. As we went, we passed a fine native stalking along. Behind him came a woman who seemed to have the entire household belongings piled upon her head! The collection included a frying pan! “I never have my camera when I want it,” groaned Suzanne. “That’s an opportunity that will occur often enough, Mrs. Blair,” said Colonel Race. “So don’t lament.” We arrived back on the bridge. “Shall we go into"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,9,"the rainbow forest?” he continued. “Or are you afraid of getting wet?” Suzanne and I accompanied him. Sir Eustace went back to the hotel. I was rather disappointed in the rainbow forest. There weren’t nearly enough rainbows, and we got soaked to the skin, but every now and then we got a glimpse of the Falls opposite and realized how enormously wide they are. Oh, dear, dear Falls, how I love and worship you and always shall! We got back to the hotel just in time to change for dinner. Sir Eustace seems to have taken a positive antipathy to Colonel Race. Suzanne and I rallied him gently, but didn’t get much satisfaction. After dinner, he retired to his sitting-room, dragging Miss Pettigrew with him. Suzanne and I talked for a while with Colonel Race, and then she declared, with an immense yawn, that she was going to bed. I didn’t want to be left alone with him, so I got up too and went to my room. But I was far too excited to go to sleep. I did not even undress. I lay back in a chair and gave myself up to dreaming. And all the time I was conscious of something coming nearer and nearer. . . . There was a knock at the door and I started. I got up and went to it. A little black boy held out a note. It was addressed to me in a handwriting I did not know. I took it and came back into the room. I stood there holding it. At last I opened it. It was very short: “I must see you. I dare not come to the hotel. Will you come to the clearing by the palm gully? In memory of Cabin 17 please come. The man you knew as Harry Rayburn.” My heart beat to suffocation. He was here then! Oh, I had known it—I had known it all along! I had felt him near me. All unwittingly I had come to his place of retreat. I wound a scarf round my head and stole to the door. I must be careful. He was hunted down. No one must see me meet him. I stole"
3,The Missing Will,26,CHAPTER XXIV,10,"along to Suzanne’s room. She was fast asleep. I could hear her breathing evenly. Sir Eustace? I paused outside the door of his sitting-room. Yes, he was dictating to Miss Pettigrew, I could hear her monotonous voice repeating. “I therefore venture to suggest, that in tackling this problem of coloured labour——” She paused for him to continue, and I heard him grunt something angrily. I stole on again. Colonel Race’s room was empty. I did not see him in the lounge. And he was the man I feared most! Still, I could waste no more time. I slipped quickly out of the hotel and took the path to the bridge. I crossed it and stood there waiting in the shadow. If any one had followed me, I should see them crossing the bridge. But the minutes passed, and no one came. I had not been followed. I turned and took the path to the clearing. I took six paces or so and then stopped. Something had rustled behind me. It could not be any one who had followed me from the hotel. It was some one who was already here, waiting. And immediately, without rhyme or reason, but with the sureness of instinct, I knew that it was I myself who was threatened. It was the same feeling as I had had on the _Kilmorden_ that night—a sure instinct warning me of danger. I looked sharply over my shoulder. Silence. I moved on a pace or two. Again I heard that rustle. Still walking, I looked over my shoulder again. A man’s figure came out of the shadow. He saw that I saw him, and jumped forward, hard on my track. It was too dark to recognize anybody. All I could see was that he was tall, and a European, not a native. I took to my heels and ran. I heard him pounding behind. I ran quicker, keeping my eyes fixed on the white stones that showed me where to step, for there was no moon that night. And suddenly my foot felt nothingness. I heard the man behind me laugh, an evil, sinister laugh. It rang in my ears, as I fell headlong—down—down—down to destruction far beneath."
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,1,"I came to myself slowly and painfully. I was conscious of an aching head and a shooting pain down my left arm when I tried to move, and everything seemed dream-like and unreal. Nightmare visions floated before me. I felt myself falling—falling again. Once Harry Rayburn’s face seemed to come to me out of the mist. Almost I imagined it real. Then it floated away again, mocking me. Once, I remember, some one put a cup to my lips and I drank. A black face grinned into mine—a devil’s face, I thought it, and screamed out. Then dreams again—long troubled dreams in which I vainly sought Harry Rayburn to warn him—warn him—what of? I did not know myself. But there was some danger—some great danger—and I alone could save him. Then darkness again, merciful darkness, and real sleep. I woke at last myself again. The long nightmare was over. I remembered perfectly everything that had happened, my hurried flight from the hotel to meet Harry, the man in the shadows and that last terrible moment of falling. . . . By some miracle or other I had not been killed. I was bruised and aching and very weak, but I was alive. But where was I? Moving my head with difficulty I looked round me. I was in a small room with rough wooden walls. On them were hung skins of animals and various tusks of ivory. I was lying on a kind of rough couch, also covered with skins, and my left arm was bandaged up and felt stiff and uncomfortable. At first I thought I was alone, and then I saw a man’s figure sitting between me and the light, his head turned toward the window. He was so still that he might have been"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,2,"carved out of wood. Something in the close-cropped black head was familiar to me, but I did not dare to let my imagination run astray. Suddenly he turned, and I caught my breath. It was Harry Rayburn. Harry Rayburn in the flesh. He rose and came over to me. “Feeling better?” he said a trifle awkwardly. I could not answer. The tears were running down my face. I was weak still, but I held his hand in both of mine. If only I could die like this, whilst he stood there looking down on me with that new look in his eyes. “Don’t cry, Anne. Please don’t cry. You’re safe now. No one shall hurt you.” He went and fetched a cup and brought it to me. “Drink some of this milk.” I drank obediently. He went on talking in a low coaxing tone such as he might have used to a child. “Don’t ask any more questions now. Go to sleep again. You’ll be stronger by and by. I’ll go away if you like.” “No,” I said urgently. “No, no. “Then I’ll stay.” He brought a small stool over beside me and sat there. He laid his hand over mine, and, soothed and comforted, I dropped off to sleep once more. It must have been evening then, but when I woke again the sun was high in the heavens. I was alone in the hut, but as I stirred an old native woman came running in. She was hideous as sin, but she grinned at me encouragingly. She brought me water in a basin and helped me wash my face and hands. Then she brought me a large bowl of soup, and I finished it every drop! I asked her several questions, but she only grinned"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,3,"and nodded and chattered away in a guttural language, so I gathered she knew no English. Suddenly she stood up and drew back respectfully as Harry Rayburn entered. He gave her a nod of dismissal and she went out leaving us alone. He smiled at me. “Really better to-day!” “Yes, indeed, but very bewildered still. Where am I?” “You’re on a small island on the Zambesi about four miles up from the Falls.” “Do—do my friends know I’m here?” He shook his head. “I must send word to them.” “That is as you like of course, but if I were you I should wait until you are a little stronger.” “Why?” He did not answer immediately, so I went on. “How long have I been here?” His answer amazed me. “Nearly a month.” “Oh!” I cried. “I must send word to Suzanne. She’ll be terribly anxious.” “Who is Suzanne?” “Mrs. Blair. I was with her and Sir Eustace and Colonel Race at the hotel—but you knew that surely?” He shook his head. “I know nothing, except that I found you, caught in the fork of a tree, unconscious and with a badly wrenched arm.” “Where was the tree?” “Overhanging the ravine. But for your clothes catching on the branches, you would infallibly have been dashed to pieces.” I shuddered. Then a thought struck me. “You say you didn’t know I was there. What about the note then?” “What note?” “The note you sent me, asking me to meet you in the clearing.” He stared at me. “I sent no note.” I felt myself flushing up to the roots of my hair. Fortunately he did not seem to notice. “How did you come to be on the spot in such a marvellous manner?” I asked in as nonchalant"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,4,"a manner as I could assume. “And what are you doing in this part of the world, anyway?” “I live here,” he said simply. “On this island?” “Yes, I came here after the War. Sometimes I take parties from the hotel out in my boat, but it costs me very little to live, and mostly I do as I please.” “You live here all alone?” “I am not pining for society, I assure you,” he replied coldly. “I am sorry to have inflicted mine upon you,” I retorted, “but I seem to have had very little to say in the matter.” To my surprise his eyes twinkled a little. “None whatever. I slung you across my shoulders like a sack of coal and carried you to my boat. Quite like a primitive man of the Stone Age.” “But for a different reason,” I put in. _He_ flushed this time, a deep burning blush. The tan of his face was suffused. “But you haven’t told me how you came to be wandering about so conveniently for me?” I said hastily, to cover his confusion. “I couldn’t sleep. I was restless—disturbed—had the feeling something was going to happen. In the end I took the boat and came ashore and tramped down towards the Falls. I was just at the head of the palm gully when I heard you scream.” “Why didn’t you get help from the hotel instead of carting me all the way here?” I asked. He flushed again. “I suppose it seems an unpardonable liberty to you—but I don’t think that even now you realize your danger! You think I should have informed your friends? Pretty friends, who allowed you to be decoyed out to death. No, I swore to myself that I’d take better care of"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,5,"you than any one else could. Not a soul comes to this island. I got old Batani, whom I cured of a fever once, to come and look after you. She’s loyal. She’ll never say a word. I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know.” _I could keep you here for months and no one would ever know!_ How some words please one! “You did quite right,” I said quietly. “And I shall not send word to any one. A day or so more anxiety doesn’t make much difference. It’s not as though they were my own people. They’re only acquaintances really—even Suzanne. And whoever wrote that note must have known—a great deal. It was not the work of an outsider.” I managed to mention the note this time without blushing at all. “If you would be guided by me——” he said, hesitating. “I don’t expect I shall be,” I answered candidly. “But there’s no harm in hearing.” “Do you always do what you like, Miss Beddingfeld?” “Usually,” I replied cautiously. To any one else I would have said “Always.” “I pity your husband,” he said unexpectedly. “You needn’t,” I retorted. “I shouldn’t dream of marrying any one unless I was madly in love with them. And of course there is really nothing a woman enjoys so much as doing all the things she doesn’t like for the sake of some one she _does_ like. And the more self-willed she is, the more she likes it.” “I’m afraid I disagree with you. The boot is on the other leg as a rule.” He spoke with a slight sneer. “Exactly,” I cried eagerly. “And that’s why there are so many unhappy marriages. It’s all the fault of the men. Either they give way"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,6,"to their women—and then the women despise them, or else they are utterly selfish, insist on their own way and never say ‘thank you.’ Successful husbands make their wives do just what they want, and then make a frightful fuss of them for doing it. Women like to be mastered, but they hate not to have their sacrifices appreciated. On the other hand, men don’t really appreciate women who are nice to them all the time. When I am married, I shall be a devil most of the time, but every now and then, when my husband least expects it, I shall show him what a perfect angel I can be!” Harry laughed outright. “What a cat and dog life you will lead.” “Lovers always fight,” I assured him. “Because they don’t understand each other. And by the time they do understand each other they aren’t in love any more.” “Does the reverse hold true? Are people who fight each other always lovers?” “I—I don’t know,” I said, momentarily confused. He turned away to the fireplace. “Like some more soup?” he asked in a casual tone. “Yes, please. I’m so hungry that I could eat a hippopotamus.” “That’s good.” He busied himself with the fire; I watched. “When I can get off the couch, I’ll cook for you,” I promised. “I don’t suppose you know anything about cooking.” “I can warm up things out of tins as well as you can,” I retorted, pointing to a row of tins on the mantelpiece. _“Touché,”_ he said, and laughed. His whole face changed when he laughed. It became boyish, happy—a different personality. I enjoyed my soup. As I ate it I reminded him that he had not, after all, tendered me his advice. “Ah, yes, what I was"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,7,"going to say was this. If I were you I would stay quietly _perdu_ here until you are quite strong again. Your enemies will believe you dead. They will hardly be surprised at not finding the body. It would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks and carried down with the torrent.” I shivered. “Once you are completely restored to health, you can journey quietly on to Beira and get a boat to take you back to England.” “That would be very tame,” I objected scornfully. “There speaks a foolish schoolgirl.” “I’m not a foolish schoolgirl,” I cried indignantly. “I’m a woman.” He looked at me with an expression I could not fathom as I sat up flushed and excited. “God help me, so you are,” he muttered, and went abruptly out. My recovery was rapid. The two injuries I had sustained were a knock on the head and a badly wrenched arm. The latter was the most serious and, to begin with, my rescuer had believed it to be actually broken. A careful examination, however, convinced him that it was not so, and although it was very painful I was recovering the use of it quite quickly. It was a strange time. We were cut off from the world, alone together as Adam and Eve might have been—but with what a difference! Old Batani hovered about counting no more than a dog might have done. I insisted on doing the cooking, or as much of it as I could manage with one arm. Harry was out a good part of the time, but we spent long hours together lying out in the shade of the palms, talking and quarrelling—discussing everything under high heaven, quarrelling and making it up again. We bickered a good deal,"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,8,"but there grew up between us a real and lasting comradeship such as I could never have believed possible. That—and something else. The time was drawing near, I knew it, when I should be well enough to leave and I realized it with a heavy heart. Was he going to let me go? Without a word? Without a sign? He had fits of silence, long moody intervals, moments when he would spring up and tramp off by himself. One evening the crisis came. We had finished our simple meal and were sitting in the doorway of the hut. The sun was sinking. Hairpins were necessities of life with which Harry had not been able to provide me, and my hair, straight and black, hung to my knees. I sat, my chin on my hands, lost in meditation. I felt rather than saw Harry looking at me. “You look like a witch, Anne,” he said at last, and there was something in his voice that had never been there before. He reached out his hand and just touched my hair. I shivered. Suddenly he sprang up with an oath. “You must leave here to-morrow, do you hear?” he cried. “I—I can’t bear any more. I’m only a man after all. You must go, Anne. You must. You’re not a fool. You know yourself that this can’t go on.” “I suppose not,” I said slowly. “But—it’s been happy, hasn’t it?” “Happy? It’s been hell!” “As bad as that!” “What do you torment me for? Why are you mocking at me? Why do you say that—laughing into your hair?” “I wasn’t laughing. And I’m not mocking. If you want me to go, I’ll go. But if you want me to stay—I’ll stay.” “Not that!” he cried vehemently. “Not that."
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,9,"Don’t tempt me, Anne. Do you realize what I am? A criminal twice over. A man hunted down. They know me here as Harry Parker—they think I’ve been away on a trek up country, but any day they may put two and two together—and then the blow will fall. You’re so young, Anne, and so beautiful—with the kind of beauty that sends men mad. All the world’s before you—love, life, everything. Mine’s behind me—scorched, spoiled, with a taste of bitter ashes.” “If you don’t want me——” “You know I want you. You know that I’d give my soul to pick you up in my arms and keep you here, hidden away from the world, for ever and ever. And you’re tempting me, Anne. You, with your long witch’s hair, and your eyes that are golden and brown and green and never stop laughing even when your mouth is grave. But I’ll save you from yourself and from me. You shall go to-night. You shall go to Beira——” “I’m not going to Beira,” I interrupted. “You are. You shall go to Beira if I have to take you there myself and throw you on to the boat. What do you think I’m made of? Do you think I’ll wake up night after night, fearing they’ve got you? One can’t go on counting on miracles happening. You must go back to England, Anne—and—and marry and be happy.” “With a steady man who’ll give me a good home!” “Better that than—utter disaster.” “And what of you?” His face grew grim and set. “I’ve got my work ready to hand. Don’t ask what it is. You can guess, I dare say. But I’ll tell you this—I’ll clear my name, or die in the attempt, and I’ll choke the life out"
3,The Missing Will,27,CHAPTER XXV,10,"of the damned scoundrel who did his best to murder you the other night.” “We must be fair,” I said. “He didn’t actually push me over.” “He’d no need to. His plan was cleverer than that. I went up to the path afterwards. Everything looked all right, but by the marks on the ground I saw that the stones which outline the path had been taken up and put down again in a slightly different place. There are tall bushes growing just over the edge. He’d balanced the outside stones on them, so that you’d think you were still on the path when in reality you were stepping into nothingness. God help him if I lay my hands upon him!” He paused a minute and then said in a totally different tone: “We’ve never spoken of these things, Anne, have we? But the time’s come. I want you to hear the whole story—from the beginning.” “If it hurts you to go over the past, don’t tell me,” I said in a low voice. “But I want you to know. I never thought I should speak of that part of my life to any one. Funny, isn’t it, the tricks Fate plays?” He was silent for a minute or two. The sun had set, and the velvety darkness of the African night was enveloping us like a mantle. “Some of it I know,” I said gently. “What do you know?” “I know that your real name is Harry Lucas.” Still he hesitated—not looking at me, but staring straight out in front of him. I had no clue as to what was passing in his mind, but at last he jerked his head forward as though acquiescing in some unspoken decision of his own and began his story."
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,1,"“You are right. My real name is Harry Lucas. My father was a retired soldier who came out to farm in Rhodesia. He died when I was in my second year at Cambridge.” “Were you fond of him?” I asked suddenly. “I—don’t know.” Then he flushed and went on with sudden vehemence: “Why do I say that? I _did_ love my father. We said bitter things to each other the last time I saw him, and we had many rows over my wildness and my debts, but I cared for the old man. I know how much now—when it’s too late,” he continued more quietly. “It was at Cambridge that I met the other fellow——” “Young Eardsley?” “Yes—young Eardsley. His father, as you know, was one of South Africa’s most prominent men. We drifted together at once, my friend and I. We had our love of South Africa in common and we both had a taste for the untrodden places of the world. After he left Cambridge, Eardsley had a final quarrel with his father. The old man had paid his debts twice, he refused to do so again. There was a bitter scene between them. Sir Laurence declared himself at the end of his patience—he would do no more for his son. He must stand on his own legs for a while. The result was, as you know, that those two young men went off to South America together, prospecting for diamonds. I’m not going into that now, but we had a wonderful time out there. Hardships in plenty, you understand, but it was a good life—a hand-to-mouth scramble for existence far from the beaten track—and, my God! that’s the place to know a friend. There was a bond forged between us two out there that only death could have broken. Well, as"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,2,"Colonel Race told you, our efforts were crowned with success. We found a second Kimberley in the heart of the British Guiana jungles. I can’t tell you our elation. It wasn’t so much the actual value in money of the find—you see, Eardsley was used to money, and he knew that when his father died he would be a millionaire, and Lucas had always been poor and was used to it. No, it was the sheer delight of discovery.” He paused, and then added, almost apologetically: “You don’t mind my telling it this way, do you? As though I wasn’t in it at all. It seems like that now when I look back and see those two boys. I almost forget that one of them was—Harry Rayburn.” “Tell it any way you like,” I said, and he went on: “We came to Kimberley—very cock-a-hoop over our find. We brought a magnificent selection of diamonds with us to submit to the experts. And then—in the hotel at Kimberley—we met her——” I stiffened a little, and the hand that rested on the doorpost clenched itself involuntarily. “Anita Grünberg—that was her name. She was an actress. Quite young and very beautiful. She was South African born, but her mother was a Hungarian, I believe. There was some sort of mystery about her, and that, of course, heightened her attraction for two boys home from the wilds. She must have had an easy task. We both fell for her right away, and we both took it hard. It was the first shadow that had ever come between us—but even then it didn’t weaken our friendship. Each of us, I honestly believe, was willing to stand aside for the other to go in and win. But that wasn’t her game. Sometimes, afterwards, I wondered why it hadn’t been, for"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,3,"Sir Laurence Eardsley’s only son was quite a _parti._ But the truth of it was that she was married—to a sorter in De Beers’—though nobody knew of it. She pretended enormous interests in our discovery, and we told her all about it and even showed her the diamonds. Delilah—that’s what she should have been called—and she played her part well! “The De Beers robbery was discovered, and like a thunderclap the police came down upon us. They seized our diamonds. We only laughed at first—the whole thing was so absurd. And then the diamonds were produced in court—and without question they were the stones stolen from De Beers’. Anita Grünberg had disappeared. She had effected the substitution neatly enough, and our story that these were not the stones originally in our possession was laughed to scorn. “Sir Laurence Eardsley had enormous influence. He succeeded in getting the case dismissed—but it left two young men ruined and disgraced to face the world with the stigma of thief attached to their names, and it pretty well broke the old fellow’s heart. He had one bitter interview with his son in which he heaped upon him every reproach imaginable. He had done what he could to save the family name, but from that day on his son was his son no longer. He cast him off utterly. And the boy, like the proud young fool that he was, remained silent, disdaining to protest his innocence in the face of his father’s disbelief. He came out furious from the interview—his friend was waiting for him. A week later war was declared. The two friends enlisted together. You know what happened. The best pal a man ever had was killed, partly through his own mad recklessness in rushing into unnecessary danger. He died with his name tarnished. . ."
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,4,". “I swear to you, Anne, that it was mainly on his account that I was so bitter against that woman. It had gone deeper with him than with me. I had been madly in love with her for the moment—I even think that I frightened her sometimes—but with him it was a quieter and deeper feeling. She had been the very centre of his universe—and her betrayal of him tore up the very roots of life. The blow stunned him and left him paralyzed.” Harry paused. After a minute or two he went on: “As you know, I was reported ‘Missing, presumed killed.’ I never troubled to correct the mistake. I took the name of Parker and came to this island, which I knew of old. At the beginning of the war, I had had ambitious hopes of proving my innocence, but now all that spirit seemed dead. All I felt was, ‘What’s the good?’ My pal was dead, neither he nor I had any living relations who would care. I was supposed to be dead too, let it remain at that. I led a peaceful existence here, neither happy nor unhappy—numbed of all feeling. I see now, though I did not realize it at the time, that that was partly the effect of the war. “And then one day something occurred to wake me right up again. I was taking a party of people in my boat on a trip up the river, and I was standing at the landing-stage, helping them in, when one of the men uttered a startled exclamation. It focused my attention on him. He was a small, thin man with a beard, and he was staring at me for all he was worth as though I was a ghost. So powerful was his emotion that it awakened"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,5,"my curiosity. I made inquiries about him at the hotel and learned that his name was Carton, that he came from Kimberley, and that he was a diamond-sorter employed by De Beers’. In a minute all the old sense of wrong surged over me again. I left the island and went to Kimberley. “I could find out little more about him, however. In the end, I decided that I must force an interview. I took my revolver with me. In the brief glimpse I had had of him, I had realized that he was a physical coward. No sooner were we face to face than I recognized that he was afraid of me. I soon forced him to tell me all he knew. He had engineered part of the robbery and Anita Grünberg was his wife. He had once caught sight of both of us when we were dining with her at the hotel, and, having read that I was killed, my appearance in the flesh at the Falls had startled him badly. He and Anita had married quite young, but she had soon drifted away from him. She had got in with a bad lot, he told me—and it was then for the first time that I heard of the ‘Colonel.’ Carton himself had never been mixed up in anything except this one affair—so he solemnly assured me, and I was inclined to believe him. He was emphatically not of the stuff of which successful criminals are made. “I still had the feeling that he was keeping back something. As a test, I threatened to shoot him there and then, declaring that I cared very little what became of me now. In a frenzy of terror he poured out a further story. It seems that Anita Grünberg did not quite trust the ‘Colonel.’"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,6,"Whilst pretending to hand over to him the stones she had taken from the hotel, she kept back some in her own possession. Carton advised her, with his technical knowledge, which to keep. If, at any time, these stones were produced, they were of such colour and quality as to be readily identifiable, and the experts at De Beers’ would admit at once that these stones had never passed through their hands. In this way my story of a substitution would be supported, my name would be cleared, and suspicion would be diverted to the proper quarter. I gathered that, contrary to his usual practice, the ‘Colonel’ himself had been concerned in this affair, therefore Anita felt satisfied that she had a real hold over him, should she need it. Carton now proposed that I should make a bargain with Anita Grünberg, or Nadina, as she now called herself. For a sufficient sum of money he thought that she would be willing to give up the diamonds and betray her former employer. He would cable to her immediately. “I was still suspicious of Carton. He was a man whom it was easy enough to frighten, but who, in his fright, would tell so many lies that to sift the truth out from them would be no easy job. I went back to the hotel and waited. By the following evening I judged that he would have received the reply to his cable. I called round at his house and was told that Mr. Carton was away, but would be returning on the morrow. Instantly I became suspicious. In the nick of time I found out that he was in reality sailing for England on the _Kilmorden Castle,_ which left Cape Town in two days’ time. I had just time to journey down and catch"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,7,"the same boat. “I had no intention of alarming Carton by revealing my presence on board. I had done a good deal of acting in my time at Cambridge, and it was comparatively easy for me to transform myself into a grave bearded gentleman of middle age. I avoided Carton carefully on board the boat, keeping to my own cabin as far as possible under the pretence of illness. “I had no difficulty in trailing him when we got to London. He went straight to an hotel and did not go out until the following day. He left the hotel shortly before one o’clock. I was behind him. He went straight to a house-agent in Knightsbridge. There he asked for particulars of houses to let on the river. “I was at the next table also inquiring about houses. Then suddenly in walked Anita Grünberg, Nadina—whatever you like to call her. Superb, insolent, and almost as beautiful as ever. God! how I hated her. There she was, the woman who had ruined my life—and who had also ruined a better life than mine. At that minute I could have put my hands round her neck and squeezed the life out of her inch by inch! Just for a minute or two I saw red. I hardly took in what the agent was saying. It was her voice that I heard next, high and clear, with an exaggerated foreign accent: ‘The Mill House, Marlow. The property of Sir Eustace Pedler. That sounds as though it might suit me. At any rate, I will go and see it.’ “The man wrote her an order, and she walked out again in her regal insolent manner. Not by word or a sign had she recognized Carton, yet I was sure that their meeting there was a preconceived plan. Then"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,8,"I started to jump to conclusions. Not knowing that Sir Eustace was at Cannes, I thought that this house-hunting business was a mere pretext for meeting him in the Mill House. I knew that he had been in South Africa at the time of the robbery, and never having seen him I immediately leaped to the conclusion that he himself was the mysterious ‘Colonel’ of whom I had heard so much. “I followed my two suspects along Knightsbridge. Nadina went into the Hyde Park Hotel. I quickened my pace and went in also. She walked straight into the restaurant, and I decided that I would not risk her recognizing me at the moment, but would continue to follow Carton. I was in great hopes that he was going to get the diamonds, and that by suddenly appearing and making myself known to him when he least expected it I might startle the truth out of him. I followed him down into the Tube station at Hyde Park Corner. He was standing by himself at the end of the platform. There was some girl standing near, but no one else. I decided that I would accost him then and there. You know what happened. In the sudden shock of seeing a man whom he imagined far away in South Africa, he lost his head and stepped back upon the line. He was always a coward. Under the pretext of being a doctor, I managed to search his pockets. There was a wallet with some notes in it and one or two unimportant letters, there was a roll of films—which I must have dropped somewhere later—and there was a piece of paper with an appointment made on it for the 22nd on the _Kilmorden_ Castle. In my haste to get away before any one detained me,"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,9,"I dropped that also, but fortunately I remembered the figures. “I hurried to the nearest cloak-room and hastily removed my make-up. I did not want to be laid by the heels for picking a dead man’s pocket. Then I retraced my steps to the Hyde Park Hotel. Nadina was still having lunch. I needn’t describe in detail how I followed her down to Marlow. She went into the house, and I spoke to the woman at the lodge, pretending that I was with her. Then I, too, went in.” He stopped. There was a tense silence. “You will believe me, Anne, won’t you? I swear before God that what I am going to say is true. I went into the house after her with something very like murder in my heart—and she was dead! I found her in that first-floor room—God! It was horrible. Dead—and I was not more than three minutes behind her. And there was no sign of any one else in the house! Of course I realized at once the terrible position I was in. By one master-stroke the blackmailed had rid himself of the blackmailer, and at the same time had provided a victim to whom the crime would be ascribed. The hand of the ‘Colonel’ was very plain. For the second time I was to be his victim. Fool that I had been to walk into the trap so easily. “I hardly know what I did next. I managed to go out of the place looking fairly normal, but I knew that it could not be long before the crime was discovered and a description of my appearance telegraphed all over the country. “I lay low for some days, not daring to make a move. In the end chance came to my aid. I overheard a conversation between two"
3,The Missing Will,28,CHAPTER XXVI,10,"middle-aged gentlemen in the street, one of whom proved to be Sir Eustace Pedler. I at once conceived the idea of attaching myself to him as his secretary. The fragment of conversation I had overheard gave me my clue. I was now no longer so sure that Sir Eustace Pedler was the ‘Colonel.’ His house might have been appointed as a rendezvous by accident, or for some obscure motive that I had not fathomed.” “Do you know,” I interrupted, “that Guy Pagett was in Marlow at the date of the murder?” “That settles it then. I thought he was at Cannes with Sir Eustace.” “He was supposed to be in Florence—but he certainly never went _there._ I’m pretty certain he was really in Marlow, but of course I can’t prove it.” “And to think I never suspected Pagett for a minute until the night he tried to throw you overboard. The man’s a marvellous actor.” “Yes, isn’t he?” “That explains why the Mill House was chosen. Pagett could probably get in and out of it unobserved. Of course he made no objection to my accompanying Sir Eustace across in the boat. He didn’t want me laid by the heels immediately. You see, evidently Nadina didn’t bring the jewels with her to the rendezvous as they had counted on her doing. I fancy that Carton really had them and concealed them somewhere on the _Kilmorden Castle_—that’s where he came in. They hoped that I might have some clue as to where they were hidden. As long as the ‘Colonel’ did not recover the diamonds, he was still in danger—hence his anxiety to get them at all costs. Where the devil Carton hid them—if he did hide them, I don’t know.” “That’s another story,” I quoted. _“My_ story. And I’m going to tell it you now.”"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,1,"Harry listened attentively whilst I recounted all the events that I have narrated in these pages. The thing that bewildered and astonished him most was to find that all along the diamonds had been in my possession—or rather in Suzanne’s. That was a fact he had never suspected. Of course, after hearing his story, I realized the point of Carton’s little arrangement—or rather Nadina’s, since I had no doubt that it was her brain which had conceived the plan. No surprise tactics executed against her or her husband could result in the seizure of the diamonds. The secret was locked in her own brain, and the “Colonel” was not likely to guess that they had been entrusted to the keeping of an ocean steward! Harry’s vindication from the old charge of theft seemed assured. It was the other, graver charge that paralyzed all our activities. For, as things stood, he could not come out in the open to prove his case. The one thing we came back to, again and again, was the identity of the “Colonel.” Was he, or was he not, Guy Pagett? “I should say he was but for one thing,” said Harry. “It seems pretty much of a certainty that it was Pagett who murdered Anita Grünberg at Marlow—and that certainly lends colour to the supposition that he is actually the ‘Colonel,’ since Anita’s business was not of the nature to be discussed"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,2,"with a subordinate. No—the only thing that militates against that theory is the attempt to put you out of the way on the night of your arrival here. You saw Pagett left behind at Cape Town—by no possible means could he have arrived here before the following Wednesday. He is unlikely to have any emissaries in this part of the world, and all his plans were laid to deal with you in Cape Town. He might, of course, have cabled instructions to some lieutenant of his in Johannesburg, who could have joined the Rhodesian train at Mafeking, but his instructions would have had to be particularly definite to allow of that note being written.” We sat silent for a moment, then Harry went on slowly: “You say that Mrs. Blair was asleep when you left the hotel and that you heard Sir Eustace dictating to Miss Pettigrew? Where was Colonel Race?” “I could not find him anywhere.” “Had he any reason to believe that—you and I might be friendly with each other?” “He might have had,” I answered thoughtfully, remembering our conversation on the way back from the Matoppos. “He’s a very powerful personality,” I continued, “but not at all my idea of the ‘Colonel.’ And, anyway, such an idea would be absurd. He’s in the Secret Service.” “How do we know that he is? It’s the easiest thing in the world to throw out a hint"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,3,"of that kind. No one contradicts it, and the rumour spreads until every one believes it as gospel truth. It provides an excuse for all sorts of doubtful doings. Anne, do you like Race?” “I do—and I don’t. He repels me and at the same time fascinates me; but I know one thing, I’m always a little afraid of him.” “He was in South Africa, you know, at the time of the Kimberley robbery,” said Harry slowly. “But it was he who told Suzanne all about the ‘Colonel’ and how he had been in Paris trying to get on his track.” _“Camouflage_—of a particularly clever kind.” “But where does Pagett come in? Is he in Race’s pay?” “Perhaps,” said Harry slowly, “he doesn’t come in at all.” “What?” “Think back, Anne. Did you ever hear Pagett’s own account of that night on the _Kilmorden?”_ “Yes—through Sir Eustace.” I repeated it. Harry listened closely. “He saw a man coming from the direction of Sir Eustace’s cabin and followed him up on deck. Is that what he says? Now, who had the cabin opposite to Sir Eustace? Colonel Race. Supposing Colonel Race crept up on deck, and, foiled in his attack on you, fled round the deck and met Pagett just coming through the saloon door. He knocks him down and springs inside, closing the door. We dash round and find Pagett lying there. How’s that?” “You forget that"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,4,"he declares positively it was you who knocked him down.” “Well, suppose that just as he regains consciousness he sees me disappearing in the distance? Wouldn’t he take it for granted that I was his assailant? Especially as he thought all along it was I he was following?” “It’s possible, yes,” I said slowly. “But it alters all our ideas. And there are other things.” “Most of them are open to explanation. The man who followed you in Cape Town spoke to Pagett, and Pagett looked at his watch. The man might have merely asked him the time.” “It was just a coincidence, you mean?” “Not exactly. There’s a method in all this, connecting Pagett with the affair. Why was the Mill House chosen for the murder? Was it because Pagett had been in Kimberley when the diamonds were stolen? Would _he_ have been made the scapegoat if I had not appeared so providentially upon the scene?” “Then you think he may be entirely innocent?” “It looks like it, but, if so, we’ve got to find out what he was doing in Marlow. If he’s got a reasonable explanation of that, we’re on the right tack.” He got up. “It’s past midnight. Turn in, Anne, and get some sleep. Just before dawn I’ll take you over in the boat. You must catch the train at Livingstone. I’ve got a friend there who will keep you hidden away"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,5,"until the train starts. You go to Bulawayo and catch the Beira train there. I can find out from my friend in Livingstone what’s going on at the hotel and where your friends are now.” “Beira,” I said meditatively. “Yes, Anne, it’s Beira for you. This is man’s work. Leave it to me.” We had had a momentary respite from emotion whilst we talked the situation out, but it was on us again now. We did not even look at each other. “Very well,” I said, and passed into the hut. I lay down on the skin-covered couch, but I didn’t sleep, and outside I could hear Harry Rayburn pacing up and down, up and down through the long dark hours. At last he called me: “Come, Anne, it’s time to go.” I got up and came out obediently. It was still quite dark, but I knew that dawn was not far off. “We’ll take the canoe, not the motor-boat——” Harry began, when suddenly he stopped dead and held up his hand. “Hush! What’s that?” I listened, but could hear nothing. His ears were sharper than mine, however, the ears of a man who has lived long in the wilderness. Presently I heard it too—the faint splash of paddles in the water coming from the direction of the right bank of the river and rapidly approaching our little landing-stage. We strained our eyes in the darkness, and"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,6,"could make out a dark blur on the surface of the water. It was a boat. Then there was a momentary spurt of flame. Some one had struck a match. By its light I recognized one figure, the red-bearded Dutchman of the villa at Muizenberg. The others were natives. “Quick—back to the hut.” Harry swept me back with him. He took down a couple of rifles and a revolver from the wall. “Can you load a rifle?” “I never have. Show me how.” I grasped his instructions well enough. We closed the door and Harry stood by the window which overlooked the landing-stage. The boat was just about to run alongside it. “Who’s that?” called out Harry in a ringing voice. Any doubt we might have had as to our visitors’ intentions was swiftly resolved. A hail of bullets splattered round us. Fortunately neither of us was hit. Harry raised the rifle. It spat murderously, and again and again. I heard two groans and a splash. “That’s given ’em something to think about,” he muttered grimly, as he reached for the second rifle. “Stand well back, Anne, for God’s sake. And load quickly.” More bullets. One just grazed Harry’s cheek. His answering fire was more deadly than theirs. I had the rifle reloaded when he turned for it. He caught me close with his left arm and kissed me once savagely before he turned to the window"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,7,"again. Suddenly he uttered a shout. “They’re going—had enough of it. They’re a good mark out there on the water, and they can’t see how many of us there are. They’re routed for the moment—but they’ll come back. We’ll have to get ready for them.” He flung down the rifle and turned to me. “Anne! You beauty! You wonder! You little queen! As brave as a lion. Black-haired witch!” He caught me in his arms. He kissed my hair, my eyes, my mouth. “And now to business,” he said, suddenly releasing me. “Get out those tins of paraffin.” I did as I was told. He was busy inside the hut. Presently I saw him on the roof of the hut, crawling along with something in his arms. He rejoined me in a minute or two. “Go down to the boat. We’ll have to carry it across the island to the other side.” He picked up the paraffin as I disappeared. “They’re coming back,” I called softly. I had seen the blur moving out from the opposite shore. He ran down to me. “Just in time. Why—where the hell’s the boat?” Both had been cut adrift. Harry whistled softly. “We’re in a tight place, honey. Mind?” “Not with you.” “Ah, but dying together’s not much fun. We’ll do better than that. See—they’ve got two boat-loads this time. Going to land at two different points. Now for my little"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,8,"scenic effect.” Almost as he spoke a long flame shot up from the hut. Its light illuminated two crouching figures huddled together on the roof. “My old clothes—stuffed with rags—but they won’t tumble to it for some time. Come, Anne, we’ve got to try desperate means.” Hand in hand, we raced across the island. Only a narrow channel of water divided it from the shore on that side. “We’ve got to swim for it. Can you swim at all, Anne? Not that it matters. I can get you across. It’s the wrong side for a boat——too many rocks, but the right side for swimming, and the right side for Livingstone.” “I can swim a little—farther than that. What’s the danger, Harry?” For I had seen the grim look on his face. “Sharks?” “No, you little goose. Sharks live in the sea. But you’re sharp, Anne. Crocs, that’s the trouble.” “Crocodiles?” “Yes, don’t think of them—or say your prayers, whichever you feel inclined.” We plunged in. My prayers must have been efficacious, for we reached the shore without adventure, and drew ourselves up wet and dripping on the bank. “Now for Livingstone. It’s rough going, I’m afraid, and wet clothes won’t make it any better. But it’s got to be done.” That walk was a nightmare. My wet skirts flapped round my legs, and my stockings were soon torn off by the thorns. Finally I stopped, utterly exhausted."
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,9,"Harry came back to me. “Hold up, honey. I’ll carry you for a bit.” That was the way I came into Livingstone, slung across his shoulder like a sack of coals. How he did it for all that way, I don’t know. The first faint light of dawn was just breaking. Harry’s friend was a young man of twenty odd who kept a store of native curios. His name was Ned—perhaps he had another, but I never heard it. He didn’t seem in the least surprised to see Harry walk in, dripping wet, holding an equally dripping female by the hand. Men are very wonderful. He gave us food to eat, and hot coffee, and got our clothes dried for us whilst we rolled ourselves in Manchester blankets of gaudy hue. In the tiny back room of the hut we were safe from observation whilst he departed to make judicious inquiries as to what had become of Sir Eustace’s party, and whether any of them were still at the hotel. It was then that I informed Harry that nothing would induce me to go to Beira. I never meant to, anyway, but now all reason for such proceedings had vanished. The point of the plan had been that my enemies believed me dead. Now that they knew I wasn’t dead, my going to Beira would do no good whatever. They could easily follow me there and"
3,The Missing Will,29,CHAPTER XXVII,10,"murder me quietly. I should have no one to protect me. It was finally arranged that I should join Suzanne, wherever she was, and devote all my energies to taking care of myself. On no account was I to seek adventures or endeavour to checkmate the “Colonel.” I was to remain quietly with her and await instructions from Harry. The diamonds were to be deposited in the Bank at Kimberley under the name of Parker. “There’s one thing,” I said thoughtfully, “we ought to have a code of some kind. We don’t want to be hoodwinked again by messages purporting to come from one to the other.” “That’s easy enough. Any message that comes _genuinely_ from me will have the word ‘and’ crossed out in it.” “Without trade-mark, none genuine,” I murmured. “What about wires?” “Any wires from me will be signed ‘Andy.’” “Train will be in before long, Harry,” said Ned, putting his head in and withdrawing it immediately. I stood up. “And shall I marry a nice steady man if I find one?” I asked demurely. Harry came close to me. “My God! Anne, if you ever marry any one else but me, I’ll wring his neck. And as for you——” “Yes,” I said, pleasurably excited. “I shall carry you away and beat you black and blue!” “What a delightful husband I have chosen,” I said satirically. “And doesn’t he change his mind overnight!”"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,1,"_(Extract from the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_ As I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn for a quiet life—and that’s just the one thing I don’t seem able to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At 3 a.m. an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of “Tea—and for God’s sake don’t put sugar in it,” he repeated his question, laying"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,2,"stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at 5.30 with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don’t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at 6, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck! But for these small contretemps, all had been going smoothly. And then fresh calamity befell. It was the night of our arrival at the Falls. I was dictating to Miss Pettigrew in"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,3,"my sitting-room, when suddenly Mrs. Blair burst in without a word of excuse and wearing most compromising attire. “Where’s Anne?” she cried. A nice question to ask. As though I were responsible for the girl. What did she expect Miss Pettigrew to think? That I was in the habit of producing Anne Beddingfeld from my pocket at midnight or thereabouts? Very compromising for a man in my position. “I presume,” I said coldly, “that she is in her bed.” I cleared my throat and glanced at Miss Pettigrew, to show that I was ready to resume dictating. I hoped Mrs. Blair would take the hint. She did nothing of the kind. Instead she sank into a chair and waved a slippered foot in an agitated manner. “She’s not in her room. I’ve been there. I had a dream—a terrible dream—that she was in some awful danger, and I got up and went to her room, just to reassure myself, you know. She"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,4,"wasn’t there and her bed hadn’t been slept in.” She looked at me appealingly. “What shall I do, Sir Eustace?” Repressing the desire to reply, “Go to bed, and don’t worry over nothing. An able-bodied young woman like Anne Beddingfeld is perfectly well able to take care of herself,” I frowned judicially. “What does Race say about it?” Why should Race have it all his own way? Let him have some of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of female society. “I can’t find him anywhere.” She was evidently making a night of it. I sighed and sat down in a chair. “I don’t quite see the reason for your agitation,” I said patiently. “My dream——” “That curry we had for dinner!” “Oh, Sir Eustace!” The woman was quite indignant. And yet everybody knows that nightmares are a direct result of injudicious eating. “After all,” I continued persuasively, “why shouldn’t Anne Beddingfeld and Race go out for a little stroll without"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,5,"having the whole hotel aroused about it?” “You think they’ve just gone out for a stroll together? But it’s after midnight!” “One does these foolish things when one is young,” I murmured, “though Race is certainly old enough to know better.” “Do you really think so?” “I dare say they’ve run away to make a match of it,” I continued soothingly, though fully aware that I was making an idiotic suggestion. For, after all, at a place like this, where is there to run away to? I don’t know how much longer I should have gone on making feeble remarks, but at that moment Race himself walked in upon us. At any rate, I had been partly right—_he_ had been out for a stroll, but he hadn’t taken Anne with him. However, I had been quite wrong in my way of dealing with the situation. I was soon shown that. Race had the whole hotel turned upside-down in three minutes. I’ve"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,6,"never seen a man more upset. The thing is very extraordinary. Where did the girl go? She walked out of the hotel, fully dressed, about ten minutes past eleven, and she was never seen again. The idea of suicide seems impossible. She was one of those energetic young women who are in love with life, and have not the faintest intention of quitting it. There was no train either way until midday on the morrow, so she can’t have left the place. Then where the devil is she? Race is almost beside himself, poor fellow. He has left no stone unturned. All the D.C.’s, or whatever they call themselves, for hundreds of miles round have been pressed into the service. The native trackers have run about on all fours. Everything that can be done is being done—but no sign of Anne Beddingfeld. The accepted theory is that she walked in her sleep. There are signs on the path near the bridge"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,7,"which seem to show that the girl walked deliberately off the edge. If so, of course, she must have been dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Unfortunately, most of the footprints were obliterated by a party of tourists who chose to walk that way early on the Monday morning. I don’t know that it’s a very satisfactory theory. In my young days, I always was told that sleep-walkers couldn’t hurt themselves—that their own sixth sense took care of them. I don’t think the theory satisfies Mrs. Blair either. I can’t make that woman out. Her whole attitude towards Race has changed. She watches him now like a cat a mouse, and she makes obvious efforts to bring herself to be civil to him. And they used to be such friends. Altogether she is unlike herself, nervous, hysterical, starting and jumping at the least sound. I am beginning to think that it is high time I went to Jo’burg. A rumour"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,8,"came along yesterday of a mysterious island somewhere up the river, with a man and a girl on it. Race got very excited. It turned out to be all a mare’s-nest, however. The man had been there for years, and is well known to the manager of the hotel. He totes parties up and down the river in the season and points out crocodiles and a stray hippopotamus or so to them. I believe that he keeps a tame one which is trained to bite pieces out of the boat on occasions. Then he fends it off with a boat-hook, and the party feel they have really got to the back of beyond at last. How long the girl has been there is not definitely known, but it seems pretty clear that she can’t be Anne, and there is a certain delicacy in interfering in other people’s affairs. If I were this young fellow, I should certainly kick Race off the"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,9,"island if he came asking questions about my love affairs. _Later._ It is definitely settled that I go to Jo’burg to-morrow. Race urges me to do so. Things are getting unpleasant there, by all I hear, but I might as well go before they get worse. I dare say I shall be shot by a striker, anyway. Mrs. Blair was to have accompanied me, but at the last minute she changed her mind and decided to stay on at the Falls. It seems as though she couldn’t bear to take her eyes off Race. She came to me to-night and said, with some hesitation, that she had a favour to ask. Would I take charge of her souvenirs for her? “Not the animals?” I asked, in lively alarm. I always felt that I should get stuck with those beastly animals sooner or later. In the end we effected a compromise. I took charge of two small wooden boxes for her which"
3,The Missing Will,30,CHAPTER XXVIII,10,"contained fragile articles. The animals are to be packed by the local store in vast crates and sent to Cape Town by rail, where Pagett will see to their being stored. The people who are packing them say that they are of a particularly awkward shape (!), and that special cases will have to be made. I pointed out to Mrs. Blair that by the time she has got them home those animals will have cost her easily a pound apiece! Pagett is straining at the leash to rejoin me in Jo’burg. I shall make an excuse of Mrs. Blair’s cases to keep him in Cape Town. I have written him that he must receive the cases and see to their safe disposal, as they contain rare curios of immense value. So all is settled, and I and Miss Pettigrew go off into the blue together. And any one who has seen Miss Pettigrew will admit that it is perfectly respectable."
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,1,"Johannesburg, _March 6th._ There is something about the state of things here that is not at all healthy. To use the well-known phrase that I have so often read, we are all living on the edge of a volcano. Bands of strikers, or so-called strikers, patrol the streets and scowl at one in a murderous fashion. They are picking out the bloated capitalists ready for when the massacres begin, I suppose. You can’t ride in a taxi—if you do, strikers pull you out again. And the hotels hint pleasantly that when the food gives out they will fling you out on the mat! I met Reeves, my labour friend of the _Kilmorden,_ last night. He has cold feet worse than any man I ever saw. He’s like all the rest of these people, they make inflammatory speeches of enormous length, solely for political purposes, and then wish they hadn’t. He’s busy now going about and saying he didn’t really do it. When I met him, he was just off to Cape Town, where he meditates making a three days’ speech in Dutch, vindicating himself, and pointing out that the things he said really meant something entirely different. I am thankful that I do not have to sit in the Legislative Assembly of South Africa."
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,2,"The House of Commons is bad enough, but at least we have only one language, and some slight restriction as to length of speeches. When I went to the Assembly before leaving Cape Town, I listened to a gray-haired gentleman with a drooping moustache who looked exactly like the Mock Turtle in _Alice in Wonderland._ He dropped out his words one by one in a particularly melancholy fashion. Every now and then he galvanized himself to further efforts by ejaculating something that sounded like “Platt Skeet,” uttered _fortissimo_ and in marked contrast to the rest of his delivery. When he did this, half his audience yelled “Whoof, whoof!” which is possibly Dutch for “Hear, hear,” and the other half woke up with a start from the pleasant nap they had been having. I was given to understand that the gentleman had been speaking for at least three days. They must have a lot of patience in South Africa. I have invented endless jobs to keep Pagett in Cape Town, but at last the fertility of my imagination has given out, and he joins me to-morrow in the spirit of the faithful dog who comes to die by his master’s side. And I was getting on so well with my Reminiscences too! I had invented"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,3,"some extraordinarily witty things that the strike leaders said to me and I said to the strike leaders. This morning I was interviewed by a Government official. He was urbane, persuasive and mysterious in turn. To begin with, he alluded to my exalted position and importance and suggested that I should remove myself, or be removed by him, to Pretoria. “You expect trouble, then?” I asked. His reply was so worded as to have no meaning whatsoever, so I gathered that they were expecting serious trouble. I suggested to him that his Government were letting things go rather far. “There is such a thing as giving a man enough rope, and letting him hang himself, Sir Eustace.” “Oh, quite so, quite so.” “It is not the strikers themselves who are causing the trouble. There is some organization at work behind them. Arms and explosives have been pouring in, and we have made a haul of certain documents which throw a good deal of light on the methods adopted to import them. There is a regular code. Potatoes mean ‘detonators,’ cauliflower, ‘rifles,’ other vegetables stand for various explosives.” “That’s very interesting,” I commended. “More than that, Sir Eustace, we have every reason to believe that the man who runs the whole show, the directing genius"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,4,"of the affair, is at this minute in Johannesburg.” He stared at me so hard that I began to fear that he suspected me of being the man. I broke out into a cold perspiration at the thought, and began to regret that I had ever conceived the idea of inspecting a miniature revolution at first hand. “No trains are running from Jo’burg to Pretoria,” he continued. “But I can arrange to send you over by private car. In case you should be stopped on the way I can provide you with two separate passes, one issued by the Union Government, and the other stating that you are an English visitor who has nothing whatsoever to do with the Union.” “One for your people, and one for the strikers, eh?” “Exactly.” The project did not appeal to me—I know what happens in a case of that kind. You get flustered and mix the things up. I should hand the wrong pass to the wrong person, and it would end in my being summarily shot by a bloodthirsty rebel, or one of the supporters of law and order whom I notice guarding the streets wearing bowler hats and smoking pipes, with rifles tucked carelessly under their arms. Besides, what should I do with myself in"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,5,"Pretoria? Admire the architecture of the Union buildings and listen to the echoes of the shooting round Johannesburg? I should be penned up there God knows how long. They’ve blown up the railway line already, I hear. It isn’t even as if one could get a drink there. They put the place under martial law two days ago. “My dear fellow,” I said, “you don’t seem to realize that I’m studying conditions on the Rand. How the devil am I going to study them from Pretoria? I appreciate your care for my safety, but don’t you worry about me. I shall be all right.” “I warn you, Sir Eustace, that the food question is already serious.” “A little fasting will improve my figure,” I said, with a sigh. We were interrupted by a telegram being handed to me. I read it with amazement: “Anne is safe. Here with me at Kimberley. Suzanne Blair.” I don’t think I ever really believed in the annihilation of Anne. There is something peculiarly indestructible about that young woman—she is like the patent balls that one gives to terriers. She has an extraordinary knack of turning up smiling. I still don’t see why it was necessary for her to walk out of the hotel in the middle of the"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,6,"night in order to get to Kimberley. There was no train, anyway. She must have put on a pair of angel’s wings and flown there. And I don’t suppose she will ever explain. Nobody does—to me. I always have to guess. It becomes monotonous after a while. The exigencies of journalism are at the bottom of it, I suppose. “How I shot the rapids,” by our Special Correspondent. I refolded the telegram and got rid of my Governmental friend. I don’t like the prospect of being hungry, but I’m not alarmed for my personal safety. Smuts is perfectly capable of dealing with the revolution. But I would give a considerable sum of money for a drink! I wonder if Pagett will have the sense to bring a bottle of whisky with him when he arrives to-morrow? I put on my hat and went out, intending to buy a few souvenirs. The curio-shops in Jo’burg are rather pleasant. I was just studying a window full of imposing karosses, when a man coming out of the shop cannoned into me. To my surprise it turned out to be Race. I can’t flatter myself that he looked pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, he looked distinctly annoyed, but I insisted on his accompanying me"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,7,"back to the hotel. I get tired of having no one but Miss Pettigrew to talk to. “I had no idea you were in Jo’burg,” I said chattily. “When did you arrive?” “Last night.” “Where are you staying?” “With friends.” He was disposed to be extraordinarily taciturn, and seemed to be embarrassed by my questions. “I hope they keep poultry,” I remarked. “A diet of new-laid eggs and the occasional slaughtering of an old cock will be decidedly agreeable soon from all I hear.” “By the way,” I said, when we were back in the hotel, “have you heard that Miss Beddingfeld is alive and kicking?” He nodded. “She gave us quite a fright,” I said airily. “Where the devil did she go to that night, that’s what I’d like to know.” “She was on the island all the time.” “Which island? Not the one with the young man on it?” “Yes.” “How very improper,” I said. “Pagett will be quite shocked. He always did disapprove of Anne Beddingfeld. I suppose that was the young man she originally intended to meet in Durban?” “I don’t think so.” “Don’t tell me anything you don’t want to,” I said, by way of encouraging him. “I fancy that this is a young man we should all be"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,8,"very glad to lay our hands on.” “Not——?” I cried, in rising excitement. He nodded. “Harry Rayburn, _alias_ Harry Lucas—that’s his real name, you know. He’s given us all the slip once more, but we’re bound to rope him in soon.” “Dear me, dear me,” I murmured. “We don’t suspect the girl of complicity in any case. On her side it’s—just a love-affair.” I always did think Race was in love with Anne. The way he said those last words made me feel sure of it. “She’s gone to Beira,” he continued rather hastily. “Indeed,” I said, staring. “How do you know?” “She wrote to me from Bulawayo, telling me she was going home that way. The best thing she can do, poor child.” “Somehow, I don’t fancy she is in Beira,” I said meditatively. “She was just starting when she wrote.” I was puzzled. Somebody was clearly lying. Without stopping to reflect that Anne might have excellent reasons for her misleading statements, I gave myself up to the pleasure of scoring off Race. He is always so cocksure. I took the telegram from my pocket and handed it to him. “Then how do you explain this?” I asked nonchalantly. He seemed dumbfounded. “She said she was just starting for Beira,” he said, in"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,9,"a dazed voice. I know that Race is supposed to be clever. He is, in my opinion, rather a stupid man. It never seemed to occur to him that girls do not always tell the truth. “Kimberley too. What are they doing there?” he muttered. “Yes, that surprised me. I should have thought Miss Anne would have been in the thick of it here, gathering copy for the _Daily Budget.”_ “Kimberley,” he said again. The place seemed to upset him. “There’s nothing to see there—the pits aren’t being worked.” “You know what women are,” I said vaguely. He shook his head and went off. I have evidently given him something to think about. No sooner had he departed than my Government official reappeared. “I hope you will forgive me for troubling you again, Sir Eustace,” he apologized. “But there are one or two questions I should like to ask you.” “Certainly, my dear fellow,” I said cheerfully. “Ask away.” “It concerns your secretary——” “I know nothing about him,” I said hastily. “He foisted himself upon me in London, robbed me of valuable papers—for which I shall be hauled over the coals—and disappeared like a conjuring trick at Cape Town. It’s true that I was at the Falls at the same time as he"
3,The Missing Will,31,CHAPTER XXIX,10,"was, but I was at the hotel, and he was on an island. I can assure you that I never set eyes upon him the whole time that I was there.” I paused for breath. “You misunderstand me. It was of your other secretary that I spoke.” “What? Pagett?” I cried, in lively astonishment. “He’s been with me eight years—a most trustworthy fellow.” My interlocutor smiled. “We are still at cross-purposes. I refer to the lady.” “Miss Pettigrew?” I exclaimed. “Yes. She has been seen coming out of Agrasato’s Native Curio-shop.” “God bless my soul!” I interrupted. “I was going into that place myself this afternoon. You might have caught _me_ coming out!” There doesn’t seem to be any innocent thing that one can do in Jo’burg without being suspected for it. “Ah! but she has been there more than once—and in rather doubtful circumstances. I may as well tell you—in confidence, Sir Eustace—that the place is suspected of being a well-known rendezvous used by the secret organization behind this revolution. That is why I should be glad to hear all that you can tell me about this lady. Where and how did you come to engage her?” “She was lent to me,” I replied coldly, “by your own Government.” He collapsed utterly."
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ As soon as I got to Kimberley I wired to Suzanne. She joined me there with the utmost dispatch, heralding her arrival with telegrams sent off _en route._ I was awfully surprised to find that she really was fond of me—I thought I had been just a new sensation, but she positively fell on my neck and wept when we met. When we had recovered from our emotion a little, I sat down on the bed and told her the whole story from A to Z. “You always did suspect Colonel Race,” she said thoughtfully, when I had finished. “I didn’t until the night you disappeared. I liked him so much all along and thought he would make such a nice husband for you. Oh, Anne, dear, don’t be cross, but how do you know that this young man of yours is telling the truth? You believe every word he says.” “Of course"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,2,"I do,” I cried indignantly. “But what is there in him that attracts you so? I don’t see that there’s anything in him at all except his rather reckless good looks and his modern Sheik-cum-Stone-Age love-making.” I poured out the vials of my wrath upon Suzanne for some minutes. “Just because you’re comfortably married and getting fat, you’ve forgotten that there’s any such thing as romance,” I ended. “Oh, I’m not getting fat, Anne. All the worry I’ve had about you lately must have worn me to a shred.” “You look particularly well nourished,” I said coldly. “I should say you must have put on about half a stone.” “And I don’t know that I’m so comfortably married either,” continued Suzanne in a melancholy voice. “I’ve been having the most dreadful cables from Clarence ordering me to come home at once. At last I didn’t answer them, and now I haven’t heard for over a"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,3,"fortnight.” I’m afraid I didn’t take Suzanne’s matrimonial troubles very seriously. She will be able to get round Clarence all right when the times comes. I turned the conversation to the subject of the diamonds. Suzanne looked at me with a dropped jaw. “I must explain, Anne. You see, as soon as I began to suspect Colonel Race, I was terribly upset about the diamonds. I wanted to stay on at the Falls in case he might have kidnapped you somewhere close by, but didn’t know what to do about the diamonds. I was afraid to keep them in my possession——” Suzanne looked round her uneasily, as though she feared the walls might have ears, and then whispered vehemently in my ear. “A distinctly good idea,” I approved. “At the time, that is. It’s a bit awkward now. What did Sir Eustace do with the cases?” “The big ones were sent down to Cape Town."
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,4,"I heard from Pagett before I left the Falls, and he enclosed the receipt for their storage. He’s leaving Cape Town to-day, by the by, to join Sir Eustace in Johannesburg.” “I see,” I said thoughtfully. “And the small ones, where are they?” “I suppose Sir Eustace has got them with him.” I turned the matter over in my mind. “Well,” I said at last, “it’s awkward—but it’s safe enough. We’d better do nothing for the present.” Suzanne looked at me with a little smile. “You don’t like doing nothing, do you, Anne?” “Not very much,” I replied honestly. The one thing I could do was to get hold of a time-table and see what time Guy Pagett’s train would pass through Kimberley. I found that it would arrive at 5.40 on the following afternoon and depart again at 6. I wanted to see Pagett as soon as possible, and that seemed to me a"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,5,"good opportunity. The situation on the Rand was getting very serious, and it might be a long time before I got another chance. The only thing that livened up the day was a wire dispatched from Johannesburg. A most innocent-sounding telegram: “Arrived safely. All going well. Eric here, also Eustace, but not Guy. Remain where you are for the present. Andy.” Eric was our pseudonym for Race. I chose it because it is a name I dislike exceedingly. There was clearly nothing to be done until I could see Pagett. Suzanne employed herself in sending off a long soothing cable to the far-off Clarence. She became quite sentimental over him. In her way—which of course is quite different from me and Harry—she is really fond of Clarence. “I do wish he was here, Anne,” she gulped. “It’s such a long time since I’ve seen him.” “Have some face cream,” I said soothingly. Suzanne rubbed a"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,6,"little on the tip of her charming nose. “I shall want some more face cream soon too,” she remarked, “and you can only get this kind in Paris.” She sighed. “Paris!” “Suzanne,” I said, “very soon you’ll have had enough of South Africa and adventure.” “I should like a really nice hat,” admitted Suzanne wistfully. “Shall I come with you to meet Guy Pagett to-morrow?” “I prefer to go alone. He’d be shyer speaking before two of us.” So it came about that I was standing in the doorway of the hotel on the following afternoon, struggling with a recalcitrant parasol that refused to go up, whilst Suzanne lay peacefully on her bed with a book and a basket of fruit. According to the hotel porter, the train was on its good behaviour to-day and would be almost on time, though he was extremely doubtful whether it would ever get through to Johannesburg. The line"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,7,"had been blown up, so he solemnly assured me. It sounded cheerful! The train drew in just ten minutes late. Everybody tumbled out on the platform and began walking up and down feverishly. I had no difficulty in espying Pagett. I accosted him eagerly. He gave his usual nervous start at seeing me—somewhat accentuated this time. “Dear me, Miss Beddingfeld, I understood that you had disappeared.” “I have reappeared again,” I told him solemnly. “And how are you, Mr. Pagett?” “Very well, thank you—looking forward to taking up my work again with Sir Eustace.” “Mr. Pagett,” I said, “there is something I want to ask you. I hope that you won’t be offended, but a lot hangs on it, more than you can possibly guess. I want to know what you were doing at Marlow on the 8th of January last?” He started violently. “Really, Miss Beddingfeld—I—indeed——” “You _were_ there, weren’t you?” “I—for reasons of"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,8,"my own I was in the neighbourhood, yes.” “Won’t you tell me what those reasons were?” “Sir Eustace has not already told you?” “Sir Eustace? Does he know?” “I am almost sure that he does. I hoped he had not recognized me, but from the hints he has let drop, and his remarks, I fear it is only too certain. In any case, I meant to make a clean breast of the matter and offer him my resignation. He is a peculiar man, Miss Beddingfeld, with an abnormal sense of humour. It seems to amuse him to keep me on tenter-hooks. All the time, I dare say, he was perfectly well aware of the true facts. Possibly he has known them for years.” I hoped that sooner or later I should be able to understand what Pagett was talking about. He went on fluently: “It is difficult for a man of Sir Eustace’s standing to"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,9,"put himself in my position. I know that I was in the wrong, but it seemed a harmless deception. I would have thought it better taste on his part to have tackled me outright—instead of indulging in covert jokes at my expense.” A whistle blew, and the people began to surge back into the train. “Yes, Mr. Pagett,” I broke in, “I’m sure I quite agree with all you’re saying about Sir Eustace. _But why did you go to Marlow?”_ “It was wrong of me, but natural under the circumstances—yes, I still feel natural under the circumstances.” “What circumstances?” I cried desperately. For the first time Pagett seemed to recognize that I was asking him a question. His mind detached itself from the peculiarities of Sir Eustace and his own justification and came to rest on me. “I beg your pardon, Miss Beddingfeld,” he said stiffly, “but I fail to see your concern in the"
3,The Missing Will,32,CHAPTER XXX,10,"matter.” He was back in the train now, leaning down to speak to me. I felt desperate. What could one do with a man like that? “Of course, if it’s so dreadful that you’d be ashamed to speak of it to me——” I began spitefully. At last I had found the right stop. Pagett stiffened and flushed. “Dreadful? Ashamed? I don’t understand you.” “Then tell me.” In three short sentences he told me. At last I knew Pagett’s secret! It was not in the least what I expected. I walked slowly back to the hotel. There a wire was handed to me. I tore it open. It contained full and definite instructions for me to proceed forthwith to Johannesburg, or rather to a station this side of Johannesburg, where I should be met by a car. It was signed, not Andy, but Harry. I sat down in a chair to do some very serious thinking."
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,1,"_(From the diary of Sir Eustace Pedler)_ Johannesburg, _March 7th._ Pagett has arrived. He is in a blue funk of course. Suggested at once that we should go off to Pretoria. Then, when I had told him kindly but firmly that we were going to remain here, he went to the other extreme, wished he had his rifle here, and began bucking about some bridge he guarded during the Great War. A railway bridge at Little Puddecombe junction, or something of that sort. I soon cut that short by telling him to unpack the big typewriter. I thought that that would keep him employed for some time, because the typewriter was sure to have gone wrong—it always does—and he would have to take it somewhere to be mended. But I had forgotten Pagett’s powers of being in the right. “I’ve already unpacked all the cases, Sir Eustace. The typewriter is in perfect condition.” “What do you mean—all the cases?” “The two small cases as well.” “I wish you"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,2,"wouldn’t be so officious, Pagett. Those small cases were no business of yours. They belong to Mrs. Blair.” Pagett looked crestfallen. He hates to make a mistake. “So you can just pack them up again neatly,” I continued. “After that you can go out and look around you. Jo’burg will probably be a heap of smoking ruins by to-morrow, so it may be your last chance.” I thought that that would get rid of him successfully for the morning, at any rate. “There is something I want to say to you when you have the leisure, Sir Eustace.” “I haven’t got it now,” I said hastily. “At this minute I have absolutely no leisure whatsoever.” Pagett retired. “By the way,” I called after him, “what was there in those cases of Mrs. Blair’s?” “Some fur rugs, and a couple of fur—hats, I think.” “That’s right,” I assented. “She bought them on the train. They _are_ hats—of a kind—though I hardly wonder at your not recognizing them. I dare"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,3,"say she’s going to wear one of them at Ascot. What else was there?” “Some rolls of films and some baskets—a lot of baskets——” “There would be,” I assured him. “Mrs. Blair is the kind of woman who never buys less than a dozen or so of anything.” “I think that’s all, Sir Eustace, except some miscellaneous odds and ends, a motor-veil and some odd gloves—that sort of thing.” “If you hadn’t been a born idiot, Pagett, you would have seen from the start that those couldn’t possibly be my belongings.” “I thought some of them might belong to Miss Pettigrew.” “Ah, that reminds me—what do you mean by picking me out such a doubtful character as a secretary?” And I told him about the searching cross-examination I had been put through. Immediately I was sorry, I saw a glint in his eye that I knew only too well. I changed the conversation hurriedly. But it was too late. Pagett was on the war-path. He next proceeded to"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,4,"bore me with a long pointless story about the _Kilmorden._ It was about a roll of films and a wager. The roll of films being thrown through a porthole in the middle of the night by some steward who ought to have known better. I hate horse-play. I told Pagett so, and he began to tell me the story all over again. He tells a story extremely badly, anyway. It was a long time before I could make head or tail of this one. I did not see him again until lunch-time. Then he came in brimming over with excitement, like a bloodhound on the scent. I never have cared for bloodhounds. The upshot of it all was that he had seen Rayburn. “What?” I cried, startled. Yes, he had caught sight of some one whom he was sure was Rayburn crossing the street. Pagett had followed him. “And who do you think I saw him stop and speak to? Miss Pettigrew!” “What?” “Yes, Sir Eustace. And that’s"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,5,"not all. I’ve been making inquiries about her——” “Wait a bit. What happened to Rayburn?” “He and Miss Pettigrew went into that corner curio-shop——” I uttered an involuntary exclamation. Pagett stopped inquiringly. “Nothing,” I said. “Go on.” “I waited outside for ages—but they didn’t come out. At last I went in. Sir Eustace, there was no one in the shop! There must be another way out.” I stared at him. “As I was saying, I came back to the hotel and made some inquiries about Miss Pettigrew.” Pagett lowered his voice and breathed hard as he always does when he wants to be confidential. “Sir Eustace, a man was seen coming out of her room last night.” I raised my eyebrows. “And I always regarded her as a lady of such eminent respectability,” I murmured. Pagett went on without heeding. “I went straight up and searched her room. What do you think I found?” I shook my head. “This!” Pagett held up a safety razor and a stick"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,6,"of shaving soap. “What should a woman want with these?” I don’t suppose Pagett ever reads the advertisements in the high-class ladies’ papers. I do. Whilst not proposing to argue with him on the subject, I refused to accept the presence of the razor as proof positive of Miss Pettigrew’s sex. Pagett is so hopelessly behind the times. I should not have been at all surprised if he had produced a cigarette-case to support his theory. However, even Pagett has his limits. “You’re not convinced, Sir Eustace. What do you say to _this?”_ I inspected the article which he dangled aloft triumphantly. “It looks like hair,” I remarked distastefully. “It is hair. I think it’s what they call a toupee.” “Indeed,” I commented. “Now are you convinced that that Pettigrew woman is a man in disguise?” “Really, my dear Pagett, I think I am. I might have known it by her feet.” “Then that’s that. And now, Sir Eustace, I want to speak to you about my"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,7,"private affairs. I cannot doubt, from your hints and your continual allusions to the time I was in Florence, that you have found me out.” At last the mystery of what Pagett did in Florence is going to be revealed! “Make a clean breast of it, my dear fellow,” I said kindly. “Much the best way.” “Thank you, Sir Eustace.” “Is it her husband? Annoying fellows, husbands. Always turning up when they’re least expected.” “I fail to follow you, Sir Eustace. Whose husband?” “The lady’s husband.” “What lady?” “God bless my soul, Pagett, the lady you met in Florence. There must have been a lady. Don’t tell me that you merely robbed a church or stabbed an Italian in the back because you didn’t like his face.” “I am quite at a loss to understand you, Sir Eustace. I suppose you are joking.” “I am an amusing fellow sometimes, when I take the trouble, but I can assure you that I am not trying to be funny"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,8,"this minute.” “I hoped that as I was a good way off you had not recognized me, Sir Eustace.” “Recognized you where?” “At Marlow, Sir Eustace?” “At Marlow? What the devil were you doing at Marlow?” “I thought you understood that——” “I’m beginning to understand less and less. Go back to the beginning of the story and start again. You went to Florence——” “Then you don’t know after all—and you didn’t recognize me!” “As far as I can judge, you seem to have given yourself away needlessly—made a coward of by your conscience. But I shall be able to tell better when I’ve heard the whole story. Now, then, take a deep breath and start again. You went to Florence——” “But I didn’t go to Florence. That is just it.” “Well, where did you go, then?” “I went home—to Marlow.” “What the devil did you want to go to Marlow for?” “I wanted to see my wife. She was in delicate health and expecting——” “Your wife? But"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,9,"I didn’t know you were married?” “No, Sir Eustace, that is just what I am telling you. I deceived you in this matter.” “How long have you been married?” “Just over eight years. I had been married just six months when I became your secretary. I did not want to lose the post. A resident secretary is not supposed to have a wife, so I suppressed the fact.” “You take my breath away,” I remarked. “Where has she been all these years?” “We have had a small bungalow on the river at Marlow, quite close to the Mill House, for over five years.” “God bless my soul,” I muttered. “Any children?” “Four children, Sir Eustace.” I gazed at him in a kind of stupor. I might have known, all along, that a man like Pagett couldn’t have a guilty secret. The respectability of Pagett has always been my bane. That’s just the kind of secret he would have—a wife and four children. “Have you told this to"
3,The Missing Will,33,CHAPTER XXXI,10,"any one else?” I demanded at last, when I had gazed at him in fascinated interest for quite a long while. “Only Miss Beddingfeld. She came to the station at Kimberley.” I continued to stare at him. He fidgeted under my glance. “I hope, Sir Eustace, that you are not seriously annoyed?” “My dear fellow,” I said, “I don’t mind telling you here and now that you’ve blinking well torn it!” I went out seriously ruffled. As I passed the corner curio-shop, I was assailed by a sudden irresistible temptation and went in. The proprietor came forward obsequiously, rubbing his hands. “Can I show you something? Furs, curios?” “I want something quite out of the ordinary,” I said. “It’s for a special occasion. Will you show me what you’ve got?” “Perhaps you will come into my back room? We have many specialties there?” That is where I made a mistake. And I thought I was going to be so clever. I followed him through the swinging _portières._"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,1,"_(Anne’s Narrative Resumed)_ I had great trouble with Suzanne. She argued, she pleaded, she even wept before she would let me carry out my plan. But in the end I got my own way. She promised to carry out my instructions to the letter and came down to the station to bid me a tearful farewell. I arrived at my destination the following morning early. I was met by a short black-bearded Dutchman whom I had never seen before. He had a car waiting and we drove off. There was a queer booming in the distance, and I asked him what it was. “Guns,” he answered laconically. So there was fighting going on in Jo’burg! I gathered that our objective was a spot somewhere in the suburbs of the city. We turned and twisted and made several detours to get there, and every minute the guns were nearer. It was an exciting time. At last we stopped before a somewhat ramshackle building. The door was opened by a Kafir boy. My guide signed to me to enter. I stood irresolute in the dingy square hall. The man passed me and threw open a door. “The young lady to see Mr. Harry Rayburn,” he said, and laughed. Thus announced, I passed in. The room was sparsely furnished and smelt of cheap tobacco smoke. Behind a desk a man sat writing. He looked up and raised his eyebrows. “Dear me,” he said, “if it isn’t Miss Beddingfeld!” “I must be seeing double,” I apologized. “Is it Mr. Chichester, or is it Miss Pettigrew? There is an extraordinary resemblance to both of them.” “Both characters are in abeyance for the moment. I have doffed my petticoats—and my cloth likewise. Won’t you sit down?” I accepted a seat composedly. “It would seem,” I remarked, “that I have come to the wrong address.” “From your point of view, I am afraid you have. Really, Miss Beddingfeld, to fall into the trap a second time!” “It was not very bright of me,” I admitted meekly. Something about my manner seemed to puzzle him. “You hardly seem upset by the occurrence,” he remarked dryly. “Would my going into heroics have any effect upon you?”"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,2,"I asked. “It certainly would not.” “My great-aunt Jane always used to say that a true lady was neither shocked nor surprised at anything that might happen,” I murmured dreamily. “I endeavour to live up to her precepts.” I read Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew’s opinion so plainly written on his face that I hastened into speech once more. “You really are positively marvellous at make-up,” I said generously. “All the time you were Miss Pettigrew I never recognized you—even when you broke your pencil in the shock of seeing me climb upon the train at Cape Town.” He tapped upon the desk with the pencil he was holding in his hand at the minute. “All this is very well in its way, but we must get to business. Perhaps, Miss Beddingfeld, you can guess why we required your presence here?” “You will excuse me,” I said, “but I never do business with any one but principals.” I had read the phrase or something like it in a money-lender’s circular, and I was rather pleased with it. It certainly had a devastating effect upon Mr. Chichester-Pettigrew. He opened his mouth and then shut it again. I beamed upon him. “My great-uncle George’s maxim,” I added, as an afterthought. “Great-aunt Jane’s husband, you know. He made knobs for brass beds.” I doubt if Chichester-Pettigrew had ever been ragged before. He didn’t like it at all. “I think you would be wise to alter your tone, young lady.” I did not reply, but yawned—a delicate little yawn that hinted at intense boredom. “What the devil——” he began forcibly. I interrupted him. “I can assure you it’s no good shouting at me. We are only wasting time here. I have no intention of talking with underlings. You will save a lot of time and annoyance by taking me straight to Sir Eustace Pedler.” “To——” He looked dumbfounded. “Yes,” I said. “Sir Eustace Pedler.” “I—I—excuse me——” He bolted from the room like a rabbit. I took advantage of the respite to open my bag and powder my nose thoroughly. Also I settled my hat at a more becoming angle. Then I settled myself to wait with patience for my enemy’s return. He reappeared in"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,3,"a subtly chastened mood. “Will you come this way, Miss Beddingfeld?” I followed him up the stairs. He knocked at the door of a room, a brisk “Come in” sounded from inside, and he opened the door and motioned to me to pass inside. Sir Eustace Pedler sprang up to greet me, genial and smiling. “Well, well, Miss Anne.” He shook me warmly by the hand. “I’m delighted to see you. Come and sit down. Not tired after your journey? That’s good.” He sat down facing me, still beaming. It left me rather at a loss. His manner was so completely natural. “Quite right to insist on being brought straight to me,” he went on. “Minks is a fool. A clever actor—but a fool. That was Minks you saw downstairs.” “Oh, really,” I said feebly. “And now,” said Sir Eustace cheerfully, “let’s get down to facts. How long have you known that I was the ‘Colonel’?” “Ever since Mr. Pagett told me that he had seen you in Marlow when you were supposed to be in Cannes.” Sir Eustace nodded ruefully. “Yes, I told the fool he’d blinking well torn it. He didn’t understand of course. His whole mind was set on whether _I’d_ recognized _him._ It never occurred to him to wonder what I was doing down there. A piece of sheer bad luck that was. I arranged it all so carefully too, sending him off to Florence, telling the hotel I was going over to Nice for one night or possibly two. Then, by the time the murder was discovered, I was back again in Cannes, with nobody dreaming that I’d ever left the Riviera.” He still spoke quite naturally and unaffectedly. I had to pinch myself to understand that this was all real—that the man in front of me was really that deep-dyed criminal, the “Colonel.” I followed things out in my mind. “Then it was you who tried to throw me overboard on the _Kilmorden,”_ I said slowly. “It was you that Pagett followed up on deck that night?” He shrugged his shoulders. “I apologize, my dear child, I really do. I always liked you—but you were so confoundedly interfering. I couldn’t have"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,4,"all my plans brought to naught by a chit of a girl.” “I think your plan at the Falls was really the cleverest,” I said, endeavouring to look at the thing in a detached fashion. “I would have been ready to swear anywhere that you were in the hotel when I went out. Seeing is believing in future.” “Yes, Minks had one of his greatest successes as Miss Pettigrew, and he can imitate my voice quite creditably.” “There is one thing I should like to know.” “Yes?” “How did you induce Pagett to engage her?” “Oh, that was quite simple. She met Pagett in the doorway of the Trade Commissioner’s office or the Chamber of Mines, or wherever it was he went—told him I had phoned down in a hurry, and that she had been selected by the Government department in question. Pagett swallowed it like a lamb.” “You’re very frank,” I said, studying him. “There’s no earthly reason why I shouldn’t be.” I didn’t quite like the sound of that. I hastened to put my own interpretation on it. “You believe in the success of this Revolution? You’ve burnt your boats.” “For an otherwise intelligent young woman, that’s a singularly unintelligent remark. No, my dear child, I do not believe in this Revolution. I give it a couple of days longer and it will fizzle out ignominiously.” “Not one of your successes, in fact?” I said nastily. “Like all women, you’ve no idea of business. The job I took on was to supply certain explosives and arms—heavily paid for—to foment feeling generally, and to incriminate certain people up to the hilt. I’ve carried out my contract with complete success, and I was careful to be paid in advance. I took special care over the whole thing, as I intended it to be my last contract before retiring from business. As for burning my boats, as you call it, I simply don’t know what you mean. I’m not the rebel chief, or anything of that kind—I’m a distinguished English visitor, who had the misfortune to go nosing into a certain curio-shop—and saw a little more than he was meant to, and so the poor fellow was kidnapped."
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,5,"To-morrow, or the day after, when circumstances permit, I shall be found tied up somewhere in a pitiable state of terror and starvation.” “Ah!” I said slowly. “But what about me?” “That’s just it,” said Sir Eustace softly. “What about you? I’ve got you here—I don’t want to rub it in in any way—but I’ve got you here very neatly. The question is, what am I going to do with you? The simplest way of disposing of you—and, I may add, the pleasantest to myself—is the way of marriage. Wives can’t accuse their husbands, you know, and I’d rather like a pretty young wife to hold my hand and glance at me out of liquid eyes—don’t flash them at me so! You quite frighten me. I see that the plan does not commend itself to you?” “It does not.” Sir Eustace sighed. “A pity! But I am no Adelphi villain. The usual trouble, I suppose. You love another, as the books say.” “I love another.” “I thought as much—first I thought it was that long-legged, pompous ass, Race, but I suppose it’s the young hero who fished you out of the Falls that night. Women have no taste. Neither of those two have half the brains that I have. I’m such an easy person to underestimate.” I think he was right about that. Although I knew well enough the kind of man he was and must be, I could not bring myself to realize it. He had tried to kill me on more than one occasion, he had actually killed another woman, and he was responsible for endless other deeds of which I knew nothing, and yet I was quite unable to bring myself into the frame of mind for appreciating his deeds as they deserved. I could not think of him as other than our amusing, genial travelling companion. I could not even feel frightened of him—and yet I knew he was capable of having me murdered in cold blood if it struck him as necessary. The only parallel I can think of is the case of Stevenson’s Long John Silver. He must have been much the same kind of man. “Well, well,” said this extraordinary"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,6,"person, leaning back in his chair. “It’s a pity that the idea of being Lady Pedler doesn’t appeal to you. The other alternatives are rather crude.” I felt a nasty feeling going up and down my spine. Of course I had known all along that I was taking a big risk, but the prize had seemed worth it. Would things turn out as I had calculated, or would they not? “The fact of the matter is,” Sir Eustace was continuing, “I’ve a weakness for you. I really don’t want to proceed to extremes. Suppose you tell me the whole story, from the very beginning, and let’s see what we can make of it. But no romancing, mind—I want the truth.” I was not going to make any mistake over that. I had a great deal of respect for Sir Eustace’s shrewdness. It was a moment for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I told him the whole story, omitting nothing, up to the moment of my rescue by Harry. When I had finished, he nodded his head in approval. “Wise girl. You’ve made a clean breast of the thing. And let me tell you I should soon have caught you out if you hadn’t. A lot of people wouldn’t believe your story, anyway, especially the beginning part, but I do. You’re the kind of girl who would start off like that—at a moment’s notice, on the slenderest of motives. You’ve had amazing luck, of course, but sooner or later the amateur runs up against the professional and then the result is a foregone conclusion. I am the professional. I started on this business when I was quite a youngster. All things considered, it seemed to me a good way of getting rich quickly. I always could think things out, and devise ingenious schemes—and I never made the mistake of trying to carry out my schemes myself. Always employ the expert—that has been my motto. The one time I departed from it I came to grief—but I couldn’t trust any one to do that job for me. Nadina knew too much. I’m an easy-going man, kind-hearted and good tempered so long as I’m not"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,7,"thwarted. Nadina both thwarted me and threatened me—just as I was at the apex of a successful career. Once she was dead and the diamonds were in my possession, I was safe. I’ve come to the conclusion now that I bungled the job. That idiot Pagett, with his wife and family! My fault—it tickled my sense of humour to employ the fellow, with his Cinquecento poisoner’s face and his mid-Victorian soul. A maxim for you, my dear Anne. Don’t let your sense of humour carry you away. For years I’ve had an instinct that it would be wise to get rid of Pagett, but the fellow was so hard-working and conscientious that I honestly couldn’t find an excuse for sacking him. So I left things drift. “But we’re wandering from the point. The question is what to do with you. Your narrative was admirably clear, but there is one thing that still escapes me. Where are the diamonds now?” “Harry Rayburn has them,” I said, watching him. His face did not change, it retained its expression of sardonic good-humour. “H’m. I want those diamonds.” “I don’t see much chance of your getting them,” I replied. “Don’t you? Now I do. I don’t want to be unpleasant, but I should like you to reflect that a dead girl or so found in this quarter of the city will occasion no surprise. There’s a man downstairs who does those sort of jobs very neatly. Now, you’re a sensible young woman. What I propose is this: you will sit down and write to Harry Rayburn, telling him to join you here and bring the diamonds with him——” “I won’t do anything of the kind.” “Don’t interrupt your elders. I propose to make a bargain with you. The diamonds in exchange for your life. And don’t make any mistake about it, your life is absolutely in my power.” “And Harry?” “I’m far too tender-hearted to part two young lovers. He shall go free too—on the understanding, of course, that neither of you will interfere with me in future.” “And what guarantee have I that you will keep your side of the bargain?” “None whatever, my dear girl. You’ll have to"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,8,"trust me and hope for the best. Of course, if you’re in an heroic mood and prefer annihilation, that’s another matter.” This was what I had been playing for. I was careful not to jump at the bait. Gradually I allowed myself to be bullied and cajoled into yielding. I wrote at Sir Eustace’s dictation: Dear Harry, I think I see a chance of establishing your innocence beyond any possible doubt. Please follow my instructions minutely. Go to Agrasato’s curio-shop. Ask to see something “out of the ordinary,” “for a special occasion.” The man will then ask you to “come into the back room.” Go with him. You will find a messenger who will bring you to me. Do exactly as he tells you. Be sure and bring the diamonds with you. Not a word to any one. Sir Eustace stopped. “I leave the fancy touches to your own imagination,” he remarked. “But be careful to make no mistakes.” “‘Yours for ever and ever, Anne,’ will be sufficient,” I remarked. I wrote in the words. Sir Eustace stretched out his hand for the letter and read it through. “That seems all right. Now the address.” I gave it him. It was that of a small shop which received letters and telegrams for a consideration. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. Chichester-Pettigrew, _alias_ Minks, answered the summons. “This letter is to go immediately—the usual route.” “Very well, Colonel.” He looked at the name on the envelope. Sir Eustace was watching him keenly. “A friend of yours, I think?” “Of mine?” The man seemed startled. “You had a prolonged conversation with him in Johannesburg yesterday.” “A man came up and questioned me about your movements and those of Colonel Race. I gave him misleading information.” “Excellent, my dear fellow, excellent,” said Sir Eustace genially. “My mistake.” I chanced to look at Chichester-Pettigrew as he left the room. He was white to the lips, as though in deadly terror. No sooner was he outside than Sir Eustace picked up a speaking-tube that rested by his elbow and spoke down it. “That you, Schwart? Watch Minks. He’s not to leave the house without orders.” He put"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,9,"the speaking-tube down again and frowned, slightly tapping the table with his hand. “May I ask you a few questions, Sir Eustace,” I said, after a minute or two of silence. “Certainly. What excellent nerves you have, Anne. You are capable of taking an intelligent interest in things when most girls would be sniffling and wringing their hands.” “Why did you take Harry as your secretary instead of giving him up to the police?” “I wanted those cursed diamonds. Nadina, the little devil, was playing off your Harry against me. Unless I gave her the price she wanted, she threatened to sell them back to him. That was another mistake I made—I thought she’d have them with her that day. But she was too clever for that. Carton, her husband, was dead too—I’d no clue whatsoever as to where the diamonds were hidden. Then I managed to get a copy of a wireless message sent to Nadina by some one on board the _Kilmorden_—either Carton or Rayburn, I didn’t know which. It was a duplicate of that piece of paper you picked up. ‘Seventeen one twenty two,’ it ran. I took it to be an appointment with Rayburn, and when he was so desperate to get aboard the _Kilmorden_ I was convinced that I was right. So I pretended to swallow his statements, and let him come. I kept a pretty sharp watch upon him and hoped that I should learn more. Then I found Minks trying to play a lone hand and interfering with me. I soon stopped that. He came to heel all right. It was annoying not getting Cabin 17, and it worried me not being able to place you. Were you the innocent young girl you seemed, or were you not? When Rayburn set out to keep the appointment that night, Minks was told off to intercept him. Minks muffed it of course.” “But why did the wireless message say ‘seventeen’ instead of ‘seventy-one’?” “I’ve thought that out. Carton must have given that wireless operator his own memorandum to copy off on to a form, and he never read the copy through. The operator made the same mistake we all did, and"
3,The Missing Will,34,CHAPTER XXXII,10,"read it as 17.1.22 instead of 1.71.22. The thing I don’t know is how Minks got on to Cabin 17. It must have been sheer instinct.” “And the dispatch to General Smuts? Who tampered with that?” “My dear Anne, you don’t suppose I was going to have a lot of my plans given away, without making an effort to save them? With an escaped murderer as a secretary, I had no hesitation whatever in substituting blanks. Nobody would think of suspecting poor old Pedler.” “What about Colonel Race?” “Yes, that was a nasty jar. When Pagett told me he was a Secret Service fellow, I had an unpleasant feeling down the spine. I remembered that he’d been nosing around Nadina in Paris during the War—and I had a horrible suspicion that he was out after _me!_ I don’t like the way he’s stuck to me ever since. He’s one of those strong, silent men who have always got something up their sleeve.” A whistle sounded. Sir Eustace picked up the tube, listened for a minute or two, then answered: “Very well, I’ll see him now.” “Business,” he remarked. “Miss Anne, let me show you your room.” He ushered me into a small shabby apartment, a Kafir boy brought up my small suit-case, and Sir Eustace, urging me to ask for anything I wanted, withdrew, the picture of a courteous host. A can of hot water was on the washstand, and I proceeded to unpack a few necessaries. Something hard and unfamiliar in my sponge-bag puzzled me greatly. I untied the string and looked inside. To my utter amazement I drew out a small pearl-handled revolver. It hadn’t been there when I started from Kimberley. I examined the thing gingerly. It appeared to be loaded. I handled it with a comfortable feeling. It was a useful thing to have in a house such as this. But modern clothes are quite unsuited to the carrying of fire-arms. In the end I pushed it gingerly into the top of my stocking. It made a terrible bulge, and I expected every minute that it would go off and shoot me in the leg, but it really seemed the only place."
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,1,"I was not summoned to Sir Eustace’s presence until late in the afternoon. Eleven-o’clock tea and a substantial lunch had been served to me in my own apartment, and I felt fortified for further conflict. Sir Eustace was alone. He was walking up and down the room, and there was a gleam in his eye and a restlessness in his manner which did not escape me. He was exultant about something. There was a subtle change in his manner towards me. “I have news for you. Your young man is on his way. He will be here in a few minutes. Moderate your transports—I have something more to say. You attempted to deceive me this morning. I warned you that you would be wise to stick to the truth, and up to a certain point you obeyed me. Then you ran off the rails. You attempted to make me believe that the diamonds were in Harry Rayburn’s possession. At the time, I accepted your statement because it facilitated my task—the task of inducing you to decoy Harry Rayburn here. But, my dear Anne, the diamonds have been in my possession ever since I left the Falls—though I only discovered the fact yesterday.” “You know!” I gasped. “It may interest you to"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,2,"hear that it was Pagett who gave the show away. He insisted on boring me with a long pointless story about a wager and a tin of films. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together—Mrs. Blair’s distrust of Colonel Race, her agitation, her entreaty that I would take care of her souvenirs for her. The excellent Pagett had already unfastened the cases through an excess of zeal. Before leaving the hotel, I simply transferred all the rolls of films to my own pocket. They are in the corner there. I admit that I haven’t had time to examine them yet, but I notice that one is of a totally different weight to the others, rattles in a peculiar fashion, and has evidently been stuck down with seccotine, which will necessitate the use of a tin-opener. The case seems clear, does it not? And now, you see, I have you both nicely in the trap. . . . It’s a pity that you didn’t take kindly to the idea of becoming Lady Pedler.” I did not answer. I stood looking at him. There was the sound of feet on the stairs, the door was flung open, and Harry Rayburn was hustled into the room between two men. Sir"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,3,"Eustace flung me a look of triumph. “According to plan,” he said softly. “You amateurs _will_ pit yourselves against professionals.” “What’s the meaning of this?” cried Harry hoarsely. “It means that you have walked into my parlour—said the spider to the fly,” remarked Sir Eustace facetiously. “My dear Rayburn, you are extraordinarily unlucky.” “You said I could come safely, Anne?” “Do not reproach her, my dear fellow. That note was written at my dictation, and the lady could not help herself. She would have been wiser not to write it, but I did not tell her so at the time. You followed her instructions, went to the curio-shop, were taken through the secret passage from the back room—and found yourself in the hands of your enemies!” Harry looked at me. I understood his glance and edged nearer to Sir Eustace. “Yes,” murmured the latter, “decidedly you are not lucky! This is—let me see, the third encounter.” “You are right,” said Harry. “This is the third encounter. Twice you have worsted me—have you never heard that the third time the luck changes? This is my round—cover him, Anne.” I was all ready. In a flash I had whipped the pistol out of my stocking and was holding it to his head. The"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,4,"two men guarding Harry sprang forward, but his voice stopped them. “Another step—and he dies! If they come any nearer, Anne, pull the trigger—don’t hesitate.” “I shan’t,” I replied cheerfully. “I’m rather afraid of pulling it, anyway.” I think Sir Eustace shared my fears. He was certainly shaking like a jelly. “Stay where you are,” he commanded, and the men stopped obediently. “Tell them to leave the room,” said Harry. Sir Eustace gave the order. The men filed out, and Harry shot the bolt across the door behind them. “Now we can talk,” he observed grimly, and coming across the room, he took the revolver out of my hand. Sir Eustace uttered a sigh of relief and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. “I’m shockingly out of condition,” he observed. “I think I must have a weak heart. I am glad that revolver is in competent hands. I didn’t trust Miss Anne with it. Well, my young friend, as you say, now we can talk. I’m willing to admit that you stole a march upon me. Where the devil that revolver came from I don’t know. I had the girl’s luggage searched when she arrived. And where did you produce it from now? You hadn’t got it on you a minute"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,5,"ago?” “Yes, I had,” I replied. “It was in my stocking.” “I don’t know enough about women. I ought to have studied them more,” said Sir Eustace sadly. “I wonder if Pagett would have known that?” Harry rapped sharply on the table. “Don’t play the fool. If it weren’t for your grey hairs, I’d throw you out of the window. You damned scoundrel! Grey hairs, or no grey hairs, I——” He advanced a step or two, and Sir Eustace skipped nimbly behind the table. “The young are always so violent,” he said reproachfully. “Unable to use their brains, they rely solely on their muscles. Let us talk sense. For the moment you have the upper hand. But that state of affairs cannot continue. The house is full of my men. You are hopelessly outnumbered. Your momentary ascendency has been gained by an accident——” “Has it?” Something in Harry’s voice, a grim raillery, seemed to attract Sir Eustace’s attention. He stared at him. “Has it?” said Harry again. “Sit down, Sir Eustace, and listen to what I have to say.” Still covering him with the revolver, he went on: “The cards are against you this time. To begin with, listen to _that!”_ _That_ was a dull banging at the door below. There"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,6,"were shouts, oaths, and then a sound of firing. Sir Eustace paled. “What’s that?” “Race—and his people. You didn’t know, did you, Sir Eustace, that Anne had an arrangement with me by which we should know whether communications from one to the other were genuine? Telegrams were to be signed ‘Andy,’ letters were to have the word ‘and’ crossed out somewhere in them. Anne knew that your telegram was a fake. She came here of her own free will, walked deliberately into the snare, in the hope that she might catch you in your own trap. Before leaving Kimberley she wired both to me and to Race. Mrs. Blair has been in communication with us ever since. I received the letter written at your dictation, which was just what I expected. I had already discussed the probabilities of a secret passage leading out of the curio-shop with Race, and he had discovered the place where the exit was situated.” There was a screaming, tearing sound, and a heavy explosion which shook the room. “They’re shelling this part of the town. I must get you out of here, Anne.” A bright light flared up. The house opposite was on fire. Sir Eustace had risen and was passing up and down. Harry kept"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,7,"him covered with the revolver. “So you see, Sir Eustace, the game is up. It was you yourself who very kindly provided us with the clue of your whereabouts. Race’s men were watching the exit of the secret passage. In spite of the precautions you took, they were successful in following me here.” Sir Eustace turned suddenly. “Very clever. Very creditable. But I’ve still a word to say. If I’ve lost the trick, so have you. You’ll never be able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I was in Marlow on that day, that’s all you’ve got against me. No one can prove that I even knew the woman. But you knew her, you had a motive for killing her—and your record’s against you. You’re a thief, remember, a thief. There’s one thing you don’t know, perhaps. _I’ve got the diamonds._ And here goes——” With an incredibly swift movement, he stooped, swung up his arm and threw. There was a tinkle of breaking glass, as the object went through the window and disappeared into the blazing mass opposite. “There goes your only hope of establishing your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we’ll talk. I’ll drive a bargain with you. You’ve got me cornered. Race will find"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,8,"all he needs in this house. There’s a chance for me if I can get away. I’m done for if I stay, but so are you, young man! There’s a skylight in the next room. A couple of minutes’ start and I shall be all right. I’ve got one or two little arrangements all ready made. You let me out that way, and give me a start—and I leave you a signed confession that I killed Nadina.” _“Yes,_ Harry,” I cried. “Yes, yes, yes!” He turned a stern face on me. “No, Anne, a thousand times, no. You don’t know what you’re saying.” “I do. It solves everything.” “I’d never be able to look Race in the face again. I’ll take my chance, but I’m damned if I’ll let this slippery old fox get away. It’s no good, Anne. I won’t do it.” Sir Eustace chuckled. He accepted defeat without the least emotion. “Well, well,” he remarked. “You seem to have met your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude does not always pay.” There was a crash of rending wood, and footsteps surged up the stairs. Harry drew back the bolt. Colonel Race was the first to enter the room. His face lit at the sight"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,9,"of us. “You’re safe, Anne. I was afraid——” He turned to Sir Eustace. “I’ve been after you for a long time, Pedler—and at last I’ve got you.” “Everybody seems to have gone completely mad,” declared Sir Eustace airily. “These young people have been threatening me with revolvers and accusing me of the most shocking things. I don’t know what it’s all about.” “Don’t you? It means that I’ve found the ‘Colonel.’ It means that on January 8th last you were not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It means that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turned against you, you planned to do away with her—and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you.” “Indeed? And from whom did you get all this interesting information? From the man who is even now being looked for by the police? His evidence will be very valuable.” “We have other evidence. There is some one else who knew that Nadina was going to meet you at the Mill House.” Sir Eustace looked surprised. Colonel Race made a gesture with his hand. Arthur Minks _alias_ the Rev. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss Pettigrew stepped forward. He was pale and nervous, but he spoke clearly enough: “I saw Nadina in Paris the night before"
3,The Missing Will,35,CHAPTER XXXIII,10,"she went over to England. I was posing at the time as a Russian Count. She told me of her purpose. I warned her, knowing what kind of man she had to deal with, but she did not take my advice. There was a wireless message on the table. I read it. Afterwards I thought I would have a try for the diamonds myself. In Johannesburg, Mr. Rayburn accosted me. He persuaded me to come over to his side.” Sir Eustace looked at him. He said nothing, but Minks seemed visibly to wilt. “Rats always leaving a sinking ship,” observed Sir Eustace. “I don’t care for rats. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin.” “There’s just one thing I’d like to tell you, Sir Eustace,” I remarked. “That tin you threw out of the window didn’t contain the diamonds. It had common pebbles in it. The diamonds are in a perfectly safe place. As a matter of fact, they’re in the big giraffe’s stomach. Suzanne hollowed it out, put the diamonds in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn’t rattle, and plugged it up again.” Sir Eustace looked at me for some time. His reply was characteristic: “I always did hate that blinking giraffe,” he said. “It must have been instinct.”"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,1,"We were not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shells were coming over pretty fast, and I gathered that we were now more or less cut off, owing to the rebels having obtained possession of a new part of the suburbs. Our place of refuge was a farm some twenty miles or so from Johannesburg—right out on the veld. I was dropping with fatigue. All the excitement and anxiety of the last two days had left me little better than a limp rag. I kept repeating to myself, without being able to believe it, that our troubles were really over. Harry and I were together and we should never be separated again. Yet all through"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,2,"I was conscious of some barrier between us—a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace had been driven off in an opposite direction accompanied by a strong guard. He waved his hand airily to us on departing. I came out on to the _stoep_ early on the following morning and looked across the veld in the direction of Johannesburg. I could see the great dumps glistening in the pale morning sunshine, and I could hear the low rumbling mutter of the guns. The Revolution was not over yet. The farmer’s wife came out and called me in to breakfast. She was a kind, motherly soul, and I was already very"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,3,"fond of her. Harry had gone out at dawn and had not yet returned, so she informed me. Again I felt a stir of uneasiness pass over me. What was this shadow of which I was so conscious between us? After breakfast I sat out on the _stoep_, a book in my hand which I did not read. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It was not until he said “Good morning, Anne,” that I became aware of his presence. “Oh,” I said, with a flush, “it’s you.” “Yes. May I sit down?” He drew a chair up beside me. It was"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,4,"the first time we had been alone together since that day at the Matoppos. As always, I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never failed to inspire in me. “What is the news?” I asked. “Smuts will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I give this outbreak three days more before it collapses utterly. In the meantime the fighting goes on.” “I wish,” I said, “that one could be sure that the right people were the ones to get killed. I mean the ones who wanted to fight—not just all the poor people who happen to live in the parts where the fighting is going on.” He nodded. “I know what you mean, Anne. That’s"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,5,"the unfairness of war. But I’ve other news for you.” “Yes?” “A confession of incompetency on my part. Pedler has managed to escape.” “What?” “Yes. No one knows how he managed it. He was securely locked up for the night—in an upper-story room of one of the farms roundabouts which the Military have taken over, but this morning the room was empty and the bird had flown.” Secretly I was rather pleased. Never, to this day, have I been able to rid myself of a sneaking fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it’s reprehensible, but there it is. I admired him. He was a thorough-going villain, I dare say—but he was a pleasant one. I’ve never"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,6,"met any one half so amusing since. I concealed my feelings, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He wanted Sir Eustace brought to justice. There was nothing very surprising in his escape when one came to think of it. All round Jo’burg he must have innumerable spies and agents. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I was exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably had a well-planned line of retreat. Indeed, he had said as much to us. I expressed myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languished. Then Colonel Race asked suddenly for Harry. I told him that he had gone off at dawn"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,7,"and that I hadn’t seen him this morning. “You understand, don’t you, Anne, that apart from formalities, he is completely cleared? There are technicalities, of course, but Sir Eustace’s guilt is well assured. There is nothing now to keep you apart.” He said this without looking at me, in a slow, jerky voice. “I understand,” I said gratefully. “And there is no reason why he should not at once resume his real name.” “No, of course not.” “You know his real name?” The question surprised me. “Of course I do. Harry Lucas.” He did not answer, and something in the quality of his silence struck me as peculiar. “Anne, do you remember that, as we drove home"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,8,"from the Matoppos that day, I told you that I knew what I had to do?” “Of course I remember.” “I think that I may fairly say I have done it. The man you love is cleared of suspicion.” “Was that what you meant?” “Of course.” I hung my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I had entertained. He spoke again in a thoughtful voice: “When I was a mere youngster, I was in love with a girl who jilted me. After that I thought only of my work. My career meant everything to me. Then I met you, Anne—and all that seemed worth nothing. But youth’s call to youth. . . . I’ve still got"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,9,"my work.” I was silent. I suppose one can’t really love two men at once—but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man was very great. I looked up at him suddenly. “I think that you’ll go very far,” I said dreamily. “I think that you’ve got a great career ahead of you. You’ll be one of the world’s big men.” I felt as though I was uttering a prophecy. “I shall be alone, though.” “All the people who do really big things are.” “You think so?” “I’m sure of it.” He took my hand and said in a low voice: “I’d rather have had—the other.” Then Harry came striding round the corner of"
3,The Missing Will,36,CHAPTER XXXIV,10,"the house. Colonel Race rose. “Good morning—Lucas,” he said. For some reason Harry flushed up to the roots of his hair. “Yes,” I said gaily, “you must be known by your real name now.” But Harry was still staring at Colonel Race. “So you know, sir,” he said at last. “I never forget a face. I saw you once as a boy.” “What’s all this about?” I asked, puzzled, looking from one to the other. It seemed a conflict of wills between them. Race won. Harry turned slightly away. “I suppose you’re right, sir. Tell her my real name.” “Anne, this isn’t Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas was killed in the War. This is John Harold Eardsley.”"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,1,"With his last words Colonel Race had swung away and left us. I stood staring after him. Harry’s voice recalled me to myself. “Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me.” He took my hand in his and almost mechanically I drew it away. “Why did you deceive me?” “I don’t know that I can make you understand. I was afraid of all that sort of thing—the power and fascination of wealth. I wanted you to care for me just for myself—for the man I was—without ornaments and trappings.” “You mean you didn’t trust me?” “You can put it that way if you like, but it isn’t quite true. I’d"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,2,"become embittered, suspicious—always prone to look for ulterior motives—and it was so wonderful to be cared for in the way you cared for me.” “I see,” I said slowly. I was going over in my own mind the story he had told me. For the first time I noted discrepancies in it which I had disregarded—an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamonds of Nadina, the way in which he had preferred to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he had said “my friend” he had meant, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It was Lucas, the quiet fellow, who"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,3,"had loved Nadina so deeply. “How did it come about?” I asked. “We were both reckless—anxious to get killed. One night we exchanged identification discs—for luck! Lucas was killed the next day—blown to pieces.” I shuddered. “But why didn’t you tell me now? This morning? You couldn’t have doubted my caring for you by this time?” “Anne, I didn’t want to spoil it all. I wanted to take you back to the island. What’s the good of money? It can’t buy happiness. We’d have been happy on the island. I tell you I’m afraid of that other life—it nearly rotted me through once.” “Did Sir Eustace know who you"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,4,"really were?” “Oh, yes.” “And Carton?” “No. He saw us both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn’t know which was which. He accepted my statement that I was Lucas, and Nadina was deceived by his cable. She was never afraid of Lucas. He was a quiet chap—very deep. But I always had the devil’s own temper. She’d have been scared out of her life if she’d known that I’d come to life again.” “Harry, if Colonel Race hadn’t told me, what did you mean to do?” “Say nothing. Go on as Lucas.” “And your father’s millions?” “Race was welcome to them. Anyway, he would make a"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,5,"better use of them than I ever shall. Anne, what are you thinking about? You’re frowning so.” “I’m thinking,” I said slowly, “that I almost wish Colonel Race hadn’t made you tell me.” “No. He was right. I owed you the truth.” He paused, then said suddenly: “You know, Anne, I’m jealous of Race. He loves you too—and he’s a bigger man than I am or ever shall be.” I turned to him, laughing. “Harry, you idiot. It’s you I want—and that’s all that matters.” As soon as possible we started for Cape Town. There Suzanne was waiting to greet me, and we disembowelled the big giraffe together. When"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,6,"the Revolution was finally quelled, Colonel Race came down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that had belonged to Sir Lawrence Eardsley was reopened and we all took up our abode in it. There we made our plans. I was to return to England with Suzanne and to be married from her house in London. And the trousseau was to be bought in Paris! Suzanne enjoyed planning all these details enormously. So did I. And yet the future seemed curiously unreal. And sometimes, without knowing why, I felt absolutely stifled—as though I couldn’t breathe. It was the night before we were to sail."
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,7,"I couldn’t sleep. I was miserable, and I didn’t know why. I hated leaving Africa. When I came back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I was startled by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I sprang up. Harry was on the _stoep_ outside. “Put some clothes on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you.” I huddled on a few garments, and stepped out into the cool night air—still and scented, with its velvety feel. Harry beckoned me out of earshot of the house. His face looked pale and determined and his eyes were"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,8,"blazing. “Anne, do you remember saying to me once that women enjoyed doing the things they disliked for the sake of some one they liked?” “Yes,” I said, wondering what was coming. He caught me in his arms. “Anne, come away with me—now—to-night. Back to Rhodesia—back to the island. I can’t stand all this tomfoolery. I can’t wait for you any longer.” I disengaged myself a minute. “And what about my French frocks?” I lamented mockingly. To this day Harry never knows when I’m in earnest and when I’m only teasing him. “Damn your French frocks. Do you think I want to put frocks on you? I’m a"

I’m never sure of you. You’re coming with me now—to-night—and damn everybody.” He held me to him, kissing me until I could hardly breathe. “I can’t do without you any longer, Anne. I can’t indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let’s go.” “My toothbrush?” I demurred. “You can buy one. I know I’m a lunatic, but for God’s sake, _come!”_ He stalked off at a furious pace. I"
3,The Missing Will,37,CHAPTER XXXV,10,"followed him as meekly as the Barotsi woman I had observed at the Falls. Only I wasn’t carrying a frying-pan on my head. He walked so fast that it was very difficult to keep up with him. “Harry,” I said at last, in a meek voice, “are we going to walk all the way to Rhodesia?” He turned suddenly and with a great shout of laughter gathered me up in his arms. “I’m mad, sweetheart, I know it. But I do love you so.” “We’re a couple of lunatics. And, oh, Harry, you never asked me, but I’m not making a sacrifice at all! I _wanted_ to come!”"
3,The Missing Will,38,CHAPTER XXXVI,1,"That was two years ago. We still live on the island. Before me, on the rough wooden table, is the letter that Suzanne wrote me. Dear Babes in the Wood—Dear Lunatics in Love, I’m not surprised—not at all. All the time we’ve been talking Paris and frocks I felt that it wasn’t a bit real—that you’d vanish into the blue some day to be married over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you _are_ a couple of lunatics! This idea of renouncing a vast fortune is absurd. Colonel Race wanted to argue the matter, but I have persuaded him to leave"

Because, after all, honeymoons don’t last forever—you’re not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without having you fly out at me like a little wild-cat—Love in the wilderness will last a good while, but one day you will suddenly begin to dream of houses in Park Lane, sumptuous furs, Paris frocks, the largest thing in motors and the latest thing in perambulators, French maids and Norland nurses! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatics, and let it be a long one. And think of me sometimes,"

P.S.—I am sending you an assortment of frying-pans as a wedding present, and an enormous _terrine_ of _pâté de foie gras_ to remind you of me. There is another letter that I sometimes read. It came a good while after the other and was accompanied by a bulky packet. It appeared to be written from somewhere in Bolivia. My dear Anne Beddingfeld, I can’t resist writing to you, not so much for the pleasure it gives me to write, as for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to hear"

It has come in very usefully and I am getting together a nice little connection.

I can see Pagett taking both mug and post card straight to Scotland Yard without a smile on his face! Bless you, liquid eyes. Some day you will see what a mistake you have made in not marrying me.

To him, Sir Eustace was the man who tried to murder me and whom he regards as responsible for the death of his friend. Sir Eustace’s attempts on my life have always puzzled me. They are not in the picture, so to speak. For I am sure that he always had a genuinely kindly feeling towards me. Then why did he twice attempt to take my life? Harry says “because he’s a damned scoundrel,” and seems to think that settles the matter. Suzanne was more discriminating. I talked it over with her,"
3,The Missing Will,38,CHAPTER XXXVI,8,"and she put it down to a “fear complex.” Suzanne goes in rather for psycho-analysis. She pointed out to me that Sir Eustace’s whole life was actuated by a desire to be safe and comfortable. He had an acute sense of self-preservation. And the murder of Nadina removed certain inhibitions. His actions did not represent the state of his feeling towards me, but were the result of his acute fears for his own safety. I think Suzanne is right. As for Nadina, she was the kind of woman who deserved to die. Men do all sorts of questionable things in order to get rich,"
3,The Missing Will,38,CHAPTER XXXVI,9,"but women shouldn’t pretend to be in love when they aren’t for ulterior motives. I can forgive Sir Eustace easily enough, but I shall never forgive Nadina.

He’ll have that same mania for Pleiocene clay. Suzanne sent me a cable when he was born: “Congratulations and love to the latest arrival on Lunatics’ Island. Is his head dolichocephalic or brachycephalic?” I wasn’t going to stand that from Suzanne. I sent her a reply of one word, economical and to the point: “Platycephalic!” THE END"

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,1,"I believe that a well-known anecdote exists to the effect that a young writer, determined to make the commencement of his story forcible and original enough to catch and rivet the attention of the most blasé of editors, penned the following sentence: “‘Hell!’ said the Duchess.” Strangely enough, this tale of mine opens in much the same fashion. Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a Duchess! It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot. The Calais express was singularly empty—in fact, my own compartment held only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,2,"the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation “Hell!” Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush! I looked up now, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet. Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace. “Dear me, we’ve shocked the kind gentleman!” she observed to an imaginary audience. “I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but Oh, Lord, there’s reason enough for it! Do you know I’ve"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,3,"lost my only sister?” “Really?” I said politely. “How unfortunate.” “He disapproves!” remarked the lady. “He disapproves utterly—of me, and my sister—which last is unfair, because he hasn’t seen her!” I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me. “Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo! I am crushed!” She buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter. “I knew you weren’t such a mutt as you looked,” she cried. Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word “mutt.” The girl was certainly all that I most disliked, but that was no reason why I should make myself ridiculous by my attitude. I prepared to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,4,"unbend. After all, she was decidedly pretty.… “There! Now we’re friends!” declared the minx. “Say you’re sorry about my sister—” “I am desolated!” “That’s a good boy!” “Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.” I made a little bow. But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head. “Cut it out. I prefer the ‘dignified disapproval’ stunt. Oh, your face! ‘Not one of us,’ it said. And you were right there—though, mind you, it’s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It’s not every one who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I’ve shocked you again! You’ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.” She shook her head vigorously. “What are you like when you’re mad?” I"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,5,"inquired with a smile. “A regular little devil! Don’t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He’d have deserved it too. Italian blood I’ve got. I shall get into trouble one of these days.” “Well,” I begged, “don’t get mad with me.” “I shan’t. I like you—did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.” “Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.” “I’m an actress. No—not the kind you’re thinking of, lunching at the Savoy covered with jewellery, and with their photograph in every paper saying how much they love Madame So and So’s face cream. I’ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six—tumbling.” “I beg your pardon,” I said puzzled. “Haven’t you seen child acrobats?” “Oh, I understand.” “I’m American born, but I’ve spent most of my life in England. We got a new show now—” “We?” “My"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,6,"sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in. It’s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There’s to be money in it—” My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her whole-hearted determination to “make good.” This glimpse of a world unknown to me was not without its charm, and I enjoyed seeing her vivid little face light up as she talked. We passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind. “Thinking of the War?” I nodded. “You"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,7,"were through it, I suppose?” “Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me out altogether. I had a half fledged Army job for a bit. I’m a sort of private secretary now to an M. P.” “My! That’s brainy!” “No, it isn’t. There’s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of hours every day sees me through. It’s dull work too. In fact, I don’t know what I should do if I hadn’t got something to fall back upon.” “Don’t say you collect bugs!” “No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He’s a Belgian—an ex-detective. He’s set up as a private detective in London, and he’s doing extraordinarily well. He’s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.” My companion listened with widening eyes. “Isn’t that interesting, now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there’s a murder"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,8,"on I just devour the papers.” “Do you remember the Styles Case?” I asked. “Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?” I nodded. “That was Poirot’s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him, the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.” Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected dénouement. The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it. “My goodness gracious me!” cried my companion. “Where’s my powder-puff?” She proceeded to bedaub her face liberally, and then applied a stick of lip salve to her lips, observing the effect in a small pocket glass, and betraying not the faintest sign of self-consciousness. “I say,” I hesitated. “I dare say it’s cheek on my part, but why do all that sort of thing?” The girl paused in her operations,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,9,"and stared at me with undisguised surprise. “It isn’t as though you weren’t so pretty that you can afford to do without it,” I said stammeringly. “My dear boy! I’ve got to do it. All the girls do. Think I want to look like a little frump up from the country?” She took one last look in the mirror, smiled approval, and put it and her vanity-box away in her bag. “That’s better. Keeping up appearances is a bit of a fag, I grant, but if a girl respects herself it’s up to her not to let herself get slack.” To this essentially moral sentiment, I had no reply. A point of view makes a great difference. I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand. “Good-bye, and I’ll mind my language better in future.” “Oh, but surely you’ll let me look after you on the boat?” “Mayn’t be on the boat. I’ve got to see whether that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,1,1 A Fellow Traveller,10,"sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks all the same.” “Oh, but we’re going to meet again, surely? I—” I hesitated. “I want to meet your sister.” We both laughed. “That’s real nice of you. I’ll tell her what you say. But I don’t fancy we’ll meet again. You’ve been very good to me on the journey, especially after I cheeked you as I did. But what your face expressed first thing is quite true. I’m not your kind. And that brings trouble—_I___ know that well enough.…” Her face changed. For the moment all the light-hearted gaiety died out of it. It looked angry—revengeful.… “So good-bye,” she finished, in a lighter tone. “Aren’t you even going to tell me your name?” I cried, as she turned away. She looked over her shoulder. A dimple appeared in each cheek. She was like a lovely picture by Greuze. “Cinderella,” she said, and laughed. But little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,1,"It was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting-room for breakfast on the following morning. My friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the shell of his second egg. He beamed upon me as I entered. “You have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so terrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning. _Pardon___, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange him.” Elsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little man! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to one side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military moustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in appearance. For neatness of any kind, he had an absolute passion. To see an ornament set crooked, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray in one’s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter. “Order” and “Method” were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: “The true work, it is done from _within___. _The little grey cells___—remember always the little grey cells, _mon ami!___” I slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot’s greeting, that an hour’s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet “terrible.” Poirot waved his egg-spoon in vigorous refutation of my remark. “_Du tout!___ If for an hour one experiences sensations and emotions of the most terrible, one has lived many hours! Does not one of your English poets say that time is counted, not by hours, but by heart-beats?” “I fancy Browning was referring to something more romantic than"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,2,"sea sickness, though.” “Because he was an Englishman, an Islander to whom _la Manche___ was nothing. Oh, you English! With _nous autres___ it is different. Figure to yourself that a lady of my acquaintance at the beginning of the war fled to Ostend. There she had a terrible crisis of the nerves. Impossible to escape further except by crossing the sea! And she had a horror—_mais une horreur!___—of the sea! What was she to do? Daily _les Boches___ were drawing nearer. Imagine to yourself the terrible situation!” “What did she do?” I inquired curiously. “Fortunately her husband was _homme pratique___. He was also very calm, the crises of the nerves, they affected him not. _Il l’a emportée simplement!___ Naturally when she reached England she was prostrate, but she still breathed.” Poirot shook his head seriously. I composed my face as best I could. Suddenly he stiffened and pointed a dramatic finger at the toast rack. “Ah, par exemple, c’est trop fort!” he cried. “What is it?” “This piece of toast. You remark him not?” He whipped the offender out of the rack, and held it up for me to examine. “Is it square? No. Is it a triangle? Again no. Is it even round? No. Is it of any shape remotely pleasing to the eye? What symmetry have we here? None.” “It’s cut from a cottage loaf,” I explained soothingly. Poirot threw me a withering glance. “What an intelligence has my friend Hastings!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Comprehend you not that I have forbidden such a loaf—a loaf haphazard and shapeless, that no baker should permit himself to bake!” I endeavoured to distract his mind. “Anything interesting come by the post?” Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air. “I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist. The cases I have been employed upon lately were _banal___ to the last degree."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,3,"In verity I am reduced to recovering lost lap-dogs for fashionable ladies! The last problem that presented any interest was that intricate little affair of the Yardly diamond, and that was—how many months ago, my friend?” He shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter. “Cheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you know, there may be a great Case looming on the horizon.” Poirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which he opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes that lay by his plate. “A bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.” “Yes?” pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case. “He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.” “How does he thank you?” I asked curiously, for I knew my Japp. “He is kind enough to say that I am a wonderful sport for my age, and that he was glad to have had the chance of letting me in on the case.” This was so typical of Japp, that I could not forbear a chuckle. Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly. “A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local boy scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lap-dog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah—” I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me. “This is out of the ordinary, _mon ami___. Read for yourself.” The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand: “Villa Geneviève Merlinville-sur-Mer"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,4,"France “_Dear Sir___, “I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France. I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee. “Assuring you once more that the matter is _urgent___, “Yours faithfully “P. T. RENAULD.” Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible: “For God’s sake, come!” I handed the letter back with quickened pulses. “At last!” I said. “Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.” “Yes, indeed,” said Poirot meditatively. “You will go of course,” I continued. Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave. “See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o’clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me, _n’est-ce"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,5,"pas?___” “Well—” “You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.” “Oh, that’s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.” “Ta-ta-ta. I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?” “There’s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name’s Renauld. I don’t know whether it could be the same.” “But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is in Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress finely.” “Dear me, Poirot,” I said, my excitement rising, “I smell some goodly shekels in this. If we succeed, we shall make our fortunes!” “Do not be too sure of that, my friend. A rich man and his money are not so easily parted. Me, I have seen a well-known millionaire turn out a tramful of people to seek for a dropped halfpenny.” I acknowledged the wisdom of this. “In any case,” continued Poirot, “it is not the money which attracts me here. Certainly it will be pleasant to have _carte blanche___ in our investigations; one can be sure that way of wasting no time, but it is something a little bizarre in this problem which arouses my interest. You remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?” I considered. “Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the end his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he scrawled those four desperate words.” But my friend shook his head energetically. “You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?” “Well?” I said puzzled. “_Mon Dieu, mon ami___, but use your little grey cells! Is it not obvious? M. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it carefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet.”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,6,"“But why?” “_Parbleu!___ so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.” “What?” “_Mais, oui___—to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!” He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement: “And so, _mon ami___, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.” “Merlinville,” I murmured thoughtfully. “I’ve heard of it, I think.” Poirot nodded. “It is a quiet little place—but chic! It lies about midway between Bolougne and Calais. It is rapidly becoming the fashion. Rich English people who wish to be quiet are taking it up. M. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?” “Yes, in Rutland Gate, as far as I remember. Also a big place in the country, somewhere in Hertfordshire. But I really know very little about him, he doesn’t do much in a social way. I believe he has large South American interests in the City, and has spent most of his life out in Chile and the Argentino.” “Well, we shall hear all details from the man himself. Come, let us pack. A small suit-case each, and then a taxi to Victoria.” “And the Countess?” I inquired with a smile. “Ah! _je m’en fiche!___ Her case was certainly not interesting.” “Why so sure of that?” “Because in that case she would have come, not written. A woman cannot wait—always remember that, Hastings.” Eleven o’clock saw our departure from Victoria on our way to Dover. Before starting Poirot had despatched a telegram to Mr. Renauld giving the time of our arrival at Calais. “I’m surprised you haven’t invested in a few bottles of some sea sick remedy, Poirot,” I observed maliciously, as I recalled our conversation at breakfast. My friend, who was anxiously scanning the weather,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,7,"turned a reproachful face upon me. “Is it that you have forgotten the method most excellent of Laverguier? His system, I practise it always. One balances oneself, if you remember, turning the head from left to right, breathing in and out, counting six between each breath.” “H’m,” I demurred. “You’ll be rather tired of balancing yourself and counting six by the time you get to Santiago, or Buenos Ayres, or wherever it is you land.” “_Quelle idée!___ You do not figure to yourself that I shall go to Santiago?” “Mr. Renauld suggests it in his letter.” “He did not know the methods of Hercule Poirot. I do not run to and fro, making journeys, and agitating myself. My work is done from within—_here___—” he tapped his forehead significantly. As usual, this remark roused my argumentative faculty. “It’s all very well, Poirot, but I think you are falling into the habit of despising certain things too much. A finger-print has led sometimes to the arrest and conviction of a murderer.” “And has, without doubt, hanged more than one innocent man,” remarked Poirot dryly. “But surely the study of finger-prints and footprints, cigarette ash, different kinds of mud, and other clues that comprise the minute observation of details—all these are of vital importance?” “But certainly. I have never said otherwise. The trained observer, the expert, without doubt he is useful! But the others, the Hercules Poirots, they are above the experts! To them the experts bring the facts, their business is the method of the crime, its logical deduction, the proper sequence and order of the facts; above all, the true psychology of the case. You have hunted the fox, yes?” “I have hunted a bit, now and again,” I said, rather bewildered by this abrupt change of subject. “Why?” “_Eh bien___, this hunting of the fox, you need the dogs, no?” “Hounds,” I corrected gently. “Yes, of course.” “But yet,” Poirot wagged his finger at me. “You"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,8,"did not descend from your horse and run along the ground smelling with your nose and uttering loud Ow Ows?” In spite of myself I laughed immoderately. Poirot nodded in a satisfied manner. “So. You leave the work of the d— hounds to the hounds. Yet you demand that I, Hercule Poirot, should make myself ridiculous by lying down (possibly on damp grass) to study hypothetical footprints, and should scoop up cigarette ash when I do not know one kind from the other. Remember the Plymouth Express mystery. The good Japp departed to make a survey of the railway line. When he returned, I, without having moved from my apartments, was able to tell him exactly what he had found.” “So you are of the opinion that Japp wasted his time.” “Not at all, since his evidence confirmed my theory. But _I___ should have wasted my time if _I___ had gone. It is the same with so called ‘experts.’ Remember the handwriting testimony in the Cavendish Case. One counsel’s questioning brings out testimony as to the resemblances, the defence brings evidence to show dissimilarity. All the language is very technical. And the result? What we all knew in the first place. The writing was very like that of John Cavendish. And the psychological mind is faced with the question ‘Why?’ Because it was actually his? Or because some one wished us to think it was his? I answered that question, _mon ami___, and answered it correctly.” And Poirot, having effectually silenced, if not convinced me, leaned back with a satisfied air. On the boat, I knew better than to disturb my friend’s solitude. The weather was gorgeous, and the sea as smooth as the proverbial mill-pond, so I was hardly surprised to hear that Laverguier’s method had once more justified itself when a smiling Poirot joined me on disembarking at Calais. A disappointment was in store for us, as no car had been sent to meet"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,9,"us, but Poirot put this down to his telegram having been delayed in transit. “Since it is _carte blanche___, we will hire a car,” he said cheerfully. And a few minutes later saw us creaking and jolting along, in the most ramshackle of automobiles that ever plied for hire, in the direction of Merlinville. My spirits were at their highest. “What gorgeous air!” I exclaimed. “This promises to be a delightful trip.” “For you, yes. For me, I have work to do, remember, at our journey’s end.” “Bah!” I said cheerfully. “You will discover all, ensure this Mr. Renauld’s safety, run the would-be assassins to earth, and all will finish in a blaze of glory.” “You are sanguine, my friend.” “Yes, I feel absolutely assured of success. Are you not the one and only Hercule Poirot?” But my little friend did not rise to the bait. He was observing me gravely. “You are what the Scotch people call ‘fey,’ Hastings. It presages disaster.” “Nonsense. At any rate, you do not share my feelings.” “No, but I am afraid.” “Afraid of what?” “I do not know. But I have a premonition—a _je ne sais quoi!___” He spoke so gravely, that I was impressed in spite of myself. “I have a feeling,” he said slowly, “that this is going to be a big affair—a long, troublesome problem that will not be easy to work out.” I would have questioned him further, but we were just coming into the little town of Merlinville, and we slowed up to inquire the way to the Villa Geneviève. “Straight on, monsieur, through the town. The Villa Geneviève is about half a mile the other side. You cannot miss it. A big Villa, overlooking the sea.” We thanked our informant, and drove on, leaving the town behind. A fork in the road brought us to a second halt. A peasant was trudging towards us, and we waited for him to come up to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,2,2 An Appeal for Help,10,"us in order to ask the way again. There was a tiny Villa standing right by the road, but it was too small and dilapidated to be the one we wanted. As we waited, the gate of it swung open and a girl came out. The peasant was passing us now, and the driver leaned forward from his seat and asked for direction. “The Villa Geneviève? Just a few steps up this road to the right, monsieur. You could see it if it were not for the curve.” The chauffeur thanked him, and started the car again. My eyes were fascinated by the girl who still stood, with one hand on the gate, watching us. I am an admirer of beauty, and here was one whom nobody could have passed without remark. Very tall, with the proportions of a young goddess, her uncovered golden head gleaming in the sunlight, I swore to myself that she was one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen. As we swung up the rough road, I turned my head to look after her. “By Jove, Poirot,” I exclaimed, “did you see that young goddess.” Poirot raised his eyebrows. “_Ça commence!___” he murmured. “Already you have seen a goddess!” “But, hang it all, wasn’t she?” “Possibly. I did not remark the fact.” “Surely you noticed her?” “_Mon ami___, two people rarely see the same thing. You, for instance, saw a goddess. I—” he hesitated. “Yes?” “I saw only a girl with anxious eyes,” said Poirot gravely. But at that moment we drew up at a big green gate, and, simultaneously, we both uttered an exclamation. Before it stood an imposing _sergent de ville___. He held up his hand to bar our way. “You cannot pass, monsieurs.” “But we wish to see Mr. Renauld,” I cried. “We have an appointment. This is his Villa, isn’t it?” “Yes, monsieur, but—” Poirot leaned forward. “But what?” “M. Renauld was murdered this morning.”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,1,"In a moment Poirot had leapt from the car, his eyes blazing with excitement. He caught the man by the shoulder. “What is that you say? Murdered? When? How?” The _sergent de ville___ drew himself up. “I cannot answer any questions, monsieur.” “True. I comprehend.” Poirot reflected for a minute. “The Commissary of Police, he is without doubt within?” “Yes, monsieur.” Poirot took out a card, and scribbled a few words on it. “_Voilà!___ Will you have the goodness to see that this card is sent in to the commissary at once?” The man took it and, turning his head over his shoulder, whistled. In a few seconds a comrade joined him and was handed Poirot’s message. There was a wait of some minutes, and then a short stout man with a huge moustache came bustling down to the gate. The _sergent de ville___ saluted and stood aside. “My dear M. Poirot,” cried the new-comer, “I am delighted to see you. Your arrival is most opportune.” Poirot’s face had lighted up. “M. Bex! This is indeed a pleasure.” He turned to me. “This is an English friend of mine, Captain Hastings—M. Lucien Bex.” The commissary and I bowed to each other ceremoniously, then M. Bex turned once more to Poirot. “_Mon vieux___, I have not seen you since 1909, that time in Ostend. I heard that you had left the Force?” “So I have. I run a private business in London.” “And you say you have information to give which may assist us?” “Possibly you know it already. You were aware that I had been sent for?” “No. By whom?” “The dead man. It seems he knew an attempt"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,2,"was going to be made on his life. Unfortunately he sent for me too late.” “_Sacri tonnerre!___” ejaculated the Frenchman. “So he foresaw his own murder? That upsets our theories considerably! But come inside.” He held the gate open, and we commenced walking towards the house. M. Bex continued to talk: “The examining magistrate, M. Hautet, must hear of this at once. He has just finished examining the scene of the crime and is about to begin his interrogations. A charming man. You will like him. Most sympathetic. Original in his methods, but an excellent judge.” “When was the crime committed?” asked Poirot. “The body was discovered this morning about nine o’clock. Madame Renauld’s evidence, and that of the doctors goes to show that the death must have occurred about 2 a.m. But enter, I pray of you.” We had arrived at the steps which led up to the front door of the Villa. In the hall another _sergent de ville___ was sitting. He rose at sight of the commissary. “Where is M. Hautet now?” inquired the latter. “In the _salon___, monsieur.” M. Bex opened a door to the left of the hall, and we passed in. M. Hautet and his clerk were sitting at a big round table. They looked up as we entered. The commissary introduced us, and explained our presence. M. Hautet, the Juge d’Instruction, was a tall, gaunt man, with piercing dark eyes, and a neatly cut grey beard, which he had a habit of caressing as he talked. Standing by the mantelpiece was an elderly man, with slightly stooping shoulders, who was introduced to us as Dr. Durand. “Most extraordinary,” remarked M. Hautet, as"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,3,"the commissary finished speaking. “You have the letter here, monsieur?” Poirot handed it to him, and the magistrate read it. “H’m. He speaks of a secret. What a pity he was not more explicit. We are much indebted to you, M. Poirot. I hope you will do us the honour of assisting us in our investigations. Or are you obliged to return to London?” “M. le juge, I propose to remain. I did not arrive in time to prevent my client’s death, but I feel myself bound in honour to discover the assassin.” The magistrate bowed. “These sentiments do you honour. Also, without doubt, Madame Renauld will wish to retain your services. We are expecting M. Giraud from the Sûreté in Paris any moment, and I am sure that you and he will be able to give each other mutual assistance in your investigations. In the meantime, I hope that you will do me the honour to be present at my interrogations, and I need hardly say that if there is any assistance you require it is at your disposal.” “I thank you, monsieur. You will comprehend that at present I am completely in the dark. I know nothing whatever.” M. Hautet nodded to the commissary, and the latter took up the tale: “This morning, the old servant Françoise, on descending to start her work, found the front door ajar. Feeling a momentary alarm as to burglars, she looked into the dining-room, but seeing the silver was safe she thought no more about it, concluding that her master had, without doubt, risen early, and gone for a stroll.” “Pardon, monsieur, for interrupting, but was that a common practice of"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,4,"his?” “No, it was not, but old Françoise has the common idea as regards the English—that they are mad, and liable to do the most unaccountable things at any moment! Going to call her mistress as usual, a younger maid, Léonie, was horrified to discover her gagged and bound, and almost at the same moment news was brought that M. Renauld’s body had been discovered, stone dead, stabbed in the back.” “Where?” “That is one of the most extraordinary features of the case. M. Poirot, the body was lying, face downwards, _in an open grave___.” “What?” “Yes. The pit was freshly dug—just a few yards outside the boundary of the Villa grounds.” “And he had been dead—how long?” Dr. Durand answered this. “I examined the body this morning at ten o’clock. Death must have taken place at least seven, and possibly ten hours previously.” “H’m, that fixes it at between midnight and 3 a.m.” “Exactly, and Madame Renauld’s evidence places it at after 2 a.m. which narrows the field still further. Death must have been instantaneous, and naturally could not have been self-inflicted.” Poirot nodded, and the commissary resumed: “Madame Renauld was hastily freed from the cords that bound her by the horrified servants. She was in a terrible condition of weakness, almost unconscious from the pain of her bonds. It appears that two masked men entered the bedroom, gagged and bound her, whilst forcibly abducting her husband. This we know at second hand from the servants. On hearing the tragic news, she fell at once into an alarming state of agitation. On arrival, Dr. Durand immediately prescribed a sedative, and we have not yet been able to question"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,5,"her. But without doubt she will awake more calm, and be equal to bearing the strain of the interrogation.” The commissary paused. “And the inmates of the house, monsieur?” “There is old Françoise, the housekeeper, she lived for many years with the former owners of the Villa Geneviève. Then there are two young girls, sisters, Denise and Léonie Oulard. Their home is in Merlinville, and they come of the most respectable parents. Then there is the chauffeur whom M. Renauld brought over from England with him, but he is away on a holiday. Finally there are Madame Renauld and her son, M. Jack Renauld. He, too, is away from home at present.” Poirot bowed his head. M. Hautet spoke: “Marchaud!” The _sergent de ville___ appeared. “Bring in the woman Françoise.” The man saluted, and disappeared. In a moment or two, he returned, escorting the frightened Françoise. “You name is Françoise Arrichet?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You have been a long time in service at the Villa Geneviève?” “Eleven years with Madame la Vicomtesse. Then when she sold the Villa this spring, I consented to remain on with the English milor. Never did I imagine—” The magistrate cut her short. “Without doubt, without doubt. Now, Françoise, in this matter of the front door, whose business was it to fasten it at night?” “Mine, monsieur. Always I saw to it myself.” “And last night?” “I fastened it as usual.” “You are sure of that?” “I swear it by the blessed saints, monsieur.” “What time would that be?” “The same time as usual, half-past ten, monsieur.” “What about the rest of the household, had they gone up to bed?” “Madame had retired some time"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,6,"before. Denise and Léonie went up with me. Monsieur was still in his study.” “Then, if any one unfastened the door afterwards, it must have been M. Renauld himself?” Françoise shrugged her broad shoulders. “What should he do that for? With robbers and assassins passing every minute! A nice idea! Monsieur was not an imbecile. It is not as though he had had to let _cette dame___ out—” The magistrate interrupted sharply: “_Cette dame?___ What lady do you mean?” “Why, the lady who came to see him.” “Had a lady been to see him that evening?” “But yes, monsieur—and many other evenings as well.” “Who was she? Did you know her?” A rather cunning look spread over the woman’s face. “How should I know who it was?” she grumbled. “I did not let her in last night.” “Aha!” roared the examining magistrate, bringing his hand down with a bang on the table. “You would trifle with the police, would you? I demand that you tell me at once the name of this woman who came to visit M. Renauld in the evenings.” “The police—the police,” grumbled Françoise. “Never did I think that I should be mixed up with the police. But I know well enough who she was. It was Madame Daubreuil.” The commissary uttered an exclamation, and leaned forward as though in utter astonishment. “Madame Daubreuil—from the Villa Marguerite just down the road?” “That is what I said, monsieur. Oh, she is a pretty one, _cellela!___” The old woman tossed her head scornfully. “Madame Daubreuil,” murmured the commissary. “Impossible.” “_Voilà,___” grumbled Françoise. “That is all you get for telling the truth.” “Not at all,” said the examining"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,7,"magistrate soothingly. “We were surprised, that is all. Madame Daubreuil then, and Monsieur Renauld, they were—” he paused delicately. “Eh? It was that without doubt?” “How should I know? But what will you? Monsieur, he was _milor anglais___—_trés riche___—and Madame Daubreuil, she was poor, that one—and _trés chic___ for all that she lives so quietly with her daughter. Not a doubt of it, she has had her history! She is no longer young, but _ma foi!___ I who speak to you have seen the men’s heads turn after her as she goes down the street. Besides lately, she has had more money to spend—all the town knows it. The little economies, they are at an end.” And Françoise shook her head with an air of unalterable certainty. M. Hautet stroked his beard reflectively. “And Madame Renauld?” he asked at length. “How did she take this—friendship.” Françoise shrugged her shoulders. “She was always most amiable—most polite. One would say that she suspected nothing. But all the same, is it not so, the heart suffers, monsieur? Day by day, I have watched Madame grow paler and thinner. She was not the same woman who arrived here a month ago. Monsieur, too, has changed. He also has had his worries. One could see that he was on the brink of a crisis of the nerves. And who could wonder, with an affair conducted such a fashion? No reticence, no discretion. _Style anglais___, without doubt!” I bounded indignantly in my seat, but the examining magistrate was continuing his questions, undistracted by side issues. “You say that M. Renauld had not to let Madame Daubreuil out? Had she left, then?” “Yes, monsieur. I"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,8,"heard them come out of the study and go to the door. Monsieur said good night, and shut the door after her.” “What time was that?” “About twenty-five minutes after ten, monsieur.” “Do you know when M. Renauld went to bed?” “I heard him come up about ten minutes after we did. The stair creaks so that one hears every one who goes up and down.” “And that is all? You heard no sound of disturbance during the night?” “Nothing whatever, monsieur.” “Which of the servants came down the first in the morning?” “I did, monsieur. At once I saw the door swinging open.” “What about the other downstairs windows, were they all fastened?” “Every one of them. There was nothing suspicious or out of place anywhere.” “Good, Françoise, you can go.” The old woman shuffled towards the door. On the threshold she looked back. “I will tell you one thing, monsieur. That Madame Daubreuil she is a bad one! Oh, yes, one woman knows about another. She is a bad one, remember that.” And, shaking her head sagely, Françoise left the room. “Léonie Oulard,” called the magistrate. Léonie appeared dissolved in tears, and inclined to be hysterical. M. Hautet dealt with her adroitly. Her evidence was mainly concerned with the discovery of her mistress gagged and bound, of which she gave rather an exaggerated account. She, like Françoise, had heard nothing during the night. Her sister, Denise, succeeded her. She agreed that her master had changed greatly of late. “Every day he became more and more morose. He ate less. He was always depressed.” But Denise had her own theory. “Without doubt it was the Mafia he"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,9,"had on his track! Two masked men—who else could it be? A terrible society that!” “It is, of course, possible,” said the magistrate smoothly. “Now, my girl, was it you who admitted Madame Daubreuil to the house last night?” “Not _last___ night, monsieur, the night before.” “But Françoise has just told us that Madame Daubreuil was here last night?” “No, monsieur. A lady _did___ come to see M. Renauld last night, but it was not Madame Daubreuil.” Surprised, the magistrate insisted, but the girl held firm. She knew Madame Daubreuil perfectly by sight. This lady was dark also, but shorter, and much younger. Nothing could shake her statement. “Had you ever seen this lady before?” “Never, monsieur.” And then the girl added diffidently: “But I think she was English.” “English?” “Yes, monsieur. She asked for M. Renauld in quite good French, but the accent—one can always tell it, _n’est-ce pas?___ Besides when they came out of the study they were speaking in English.” “Did you hear what they said? Could you understand it, I mean?” “Me, I speak the English very well,” said Denise with pride. “The lady was speaking too fast for me to catch what she said, but I heard Monsieur’s last words as he opened the door for her.” She paused, and then repeated carefully and laboriously: “‘Yeas—yeas—butt for Gaud’s saike go nauw!’” “Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now!” repeated the magistrate. He dismissed Denise and, after a moment or two for consideration, recalled Françoise. To her he propounded the question as to whether she had not made a mistake in fixing the night of Madame Daubreuil’s visit. Françoise, however, proved unexpectedly obstinate."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,3,3 At the Villa Geneviève,10,"It was last night that Madame Daubreuil had come. Without a doubt it was she. Denise wished to make herself interesting, _voilà tout!___ So she had cooked up this fine tale about a strange lady. Airing her knowledge of English too! Probably Monsieur had never spoken that sentence in English at all, and even if he had, it proved nothing, for Madame Daubreuil spoke English perfectly, and generally used that language when talking to M. and Madame Renauld. “You see, M. Jack, the son of Monsieur, was usually here, and he spoke the French very badly.” The magistrate did not insist. Instead he inquired about the chauffeur, and learned that only yesterday, M. Renauld had declared that he was not likely to use the car, and that Masters might just as well take a holiday. A perplexed frown was beginning to gather between Poirot’s eyes. “What is it?” I whispered. He shook his head impatiently, and asked a question: “Pardon, M. Bex, but without doubt M. Renauld could drive the car himself?” The commissary looked over at Françoise, and the old woman replied promptly: “No, Monsieur did not drive himself.” Poirot’s frown deepened. “I wish you would tell me what is worrying you,” I said impatiently. “See you not? In his letter M. Renauld speaks of sending the car for me to Calais.” “Perhaps he meant a hired car,” I suggested. “Doubtless that is so. But why hire a car when you have one of your own. Why choose yesterday to send away the chauffeur on a holiday—suddenly, at a moment’s notice? Was it that for some reason he wanted him out of the way before we arrived?”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,1,"Françoise had left the room. The magistrate was drumming thoughtfully on the table. “M. Bex,” he said at length, “here we have directly conflicting testimony. Which are we to believe, Françoise or Denise?” “Denise,” said the commissary decidedly. “It was she who let the visitor in. Françoise is old and obstinate, and has evidently taken a dislike to Madame Daubreuil. Besides, our own knowledge tends to show that Renauld was entangled with another woman.” “_Tiens!___” cried M. Hautet. “We have forgotten to inform M. Poirot of that.” He searched amongst the papers on the table, and finally handed the one he was in search of to my friend. “This letter, M. Poirot, we found in the pocket of the dead man’s overcoat.” Poirot took it and unfolded it. It was somewhat worn and crumbled, and was written in English in a rather unformed hand: “_My dearest one:___” Why have you not written for so long? You do love me still, don’t you? Your letters lately have been so different, cold and strange, and now this long silence. It makes me afraid. If you were to stop loving me! But that’s impossible—what a silly kid I am—always imagining things! But if you _did___ stop loving me, I don’t know what I should do—kill myself perhaps! I couldn’t live without you. Sometimes I fancy another woman is coming between us. Let her look"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,2,"out, that’s all—and you too! I’d as soon kill you as let her have you! I mean it. “But there, I’m writing high-flown nonsense. You love me, and I love you—yes, love you, love you, love you! “Your own adoring “BELLA.” There was no address or date. Poirot handed it back with a grave face. “And the assumption is, M. le juge—?” The examining magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “Obviously M. Renauld was entangled with this Englishwoman—Bella. He comes over here, meets Madame Daubreuil, and starts an intrigue with her. He cools off to the other, and she instantly suspects something. This letter contains a distinct threat. M. Poirot, at first sight the case seemed simplicity itself. Jealousy! The fact that M. Renauld was stabbed in the back seemed to point distinctly to its being a woman’s crime.” Poirot nodded. “The stab in the back, yes—but not the grave! That was laborious work, hard work—no woman dug that grave, monsieur. That was a man’s doing.” The commissary exclaimed excitedly: “Yes, yes, you are right. We did not think of that.” “As I said,” continued M. Hautet, “at first sight the case seemed simple, but the masked men, and the letter you received from M. Renauld complicate matters. Here we seem to have an entirely different set of circumstances, with no relationship between the two. As regards the letter written to yourself, do"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,3,"you think it is possible that it referred in any way to this ‘Bella,’ and her threats?” Poirot shook his head. “Hardly. A man like M. Renauld, who has led an adventurous life in out-of-the-way places, would not be likely to ask for protection against a woman.” The examining magistrate nodded his head emphatically. “My view exactly. Then we must look for the explanation of the letter—” “In Santiago,” finished the commissary. “I shall cable without delay to the police in that city, requesting full details of the murdered man’s life out there, his love affairs, his business transactions, his friendships, and any enmities he may have incurred. It will be strange if, after that, we do not hold a clue to his mysterious murder.” The commissary looked round for approval. “Excellent,” said Poirot appreciatively. “His wife, too, may be able to give us a pointer,” added the magistrate. “You have found no other letters from this Bella amongst M. Renauld’s effects?” asked Poirot. “No. Of course one of our first proceedings was to search through his private papers in the study. We found nothing of interest, however. All seemed square and above-board. The only thing at all out of the ordinary was his will. Here it is.” Poirot ran through the document. “So. A legacy of a thousand pounds to Mr. Stonor—who is he, by the way?” “M. Renauld’s secretary."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,4,"He remained in England, but was over here once or twice for a week-end.” “And everything else left unconditionally to his beloved wife, Eloise. Simply drawn up, but perfectly legal. Witnessed by the two servants, Denise and Françoise. Nothing so very unusual about that.” He handed it back. “Perhaps,” began Bex, “you did not notice—” “The date?” twinkled Poirot. “But yes, I noticed it. A fortnight ago. Possibly it marks his first intimation of danger. Many rich men die intestate through never considering the likelihood of their demise. But it is dangerous to draw conclusions prematurely. It points, however, to his having a real liking and fondness for his wife, in spite of his amorous intrigues.” “Yes,” said M. Hautet doubtfully. “But it is possibly a little unfair on his son, since it leaves him entirely dependent on his mother. If she were to marry again, and her second husband obtained an ascendancy over her, this boy might never touch a penny of his father’s money.” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Man is a vain animal. M. Renauld figured to himself, without doubt, that his widow would never marry again. As to the son, it may have been a wise precaution to leave the money in his mother’s hands. The sons of rich men are proverbially wild.” “It may be as you say. Now, M. Poirot, you would without doubt like to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,5,"visit the scene of the crime. I am sorry that the body has been removed, but of course photographs have been taken from every conceivable angle, and will be at your disposal as soon as they are available.” “I thank you, monsieur, for all your courtesy.” The commissary rose. “Come with me, monsieurs.” He opened the door, and bowed ceremoniously to Poirot to precede him. Poirot, with equal politeness, drew back and bowed to the commissary. “Monsieur.” “Monsieur.” At last they got out into the hall. “That room there, it is the study, _hein?___” asked Poirot suddenly, nodding towards the door opposite. “Yes. You would like to see it?” He threw the door open as he spoke, and we entered. The room which M. Renauld had chosen for his own particular use was small, but furnished with great taste and comfort. A businesslike writing desk, with many pigeon holes, stood in the window. Two large leather-covered armchairs faced the fireplace, and between them was a round table covered with the latest books and magazines. Bookshelves lined two of the walls, and at the end of the room opposite the window there was a handsome oak sideboard with a tantalus on top. The curtains and _portière___ were of a soft dull green, and the carpet matched them in tone. Poirot stood a moment taking in the room, then he stepped forward,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,6,"passed his hand lightly over the backs of the leather chairs, picked up a magazine from the table, and drew a finger gingerly over the surface of the oak sideboard. His face expressed complete approval. “No dust?” I asked, with a smile. He beamed on me, appreciative of my knowledge of his peculiarities. “Not a particle, _mon ami!___ And for once, perhaps, it is a pity.” His sharp, birdlike eyes darted here and there. “Ah!” he remarked suddenly, with an intonation of relief. “The hearth-rug is crooked,” and he bent down to straighten it. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation and rose. In his hand he held a small fragment of paper. “In France, as in England,” he remarked, “the domestics omit to sweep under the mats!” Bex took the fragment from him, and I came closer to examine it. “You recognize it—eh, Hastings?” I shook my head, puzzled—and yet that particular shade of pink paper was very familiar. The commissary’s mental processes were quicker than mine. “A fragment of a cheque,” he exclaimed. The piece of paper was roughly about two inches square. On it was written in ink the word “Duveen.” “_Bien___,” said Bex. “This cheque was payable to, or drawn by, one named Duveen.” “The former, I fancy,” said Poirot, “for, if I am not mistaken, the handwriting is that of M. Renauld.” That was soon established, by"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,7,"comparing it with a memorandum from the desk. “Dear me,” murmured the commissary, with a crestfallen air, “I really cannot imagine how I came to overlook this.” Poirot laughed. “The moral of that is, always look under the mats! My friend Hastings here will tell you that anything in the least crooked is a torment to me. As soon as I saw that the hearth-rug was out of the straight, I said to myself: ‘_Tiens!___ The leg of the chair caught it in being pushed back. Possibly there may be something beneath it which the good Françoise overlooked.’” “Françoise?” “Or Denise, or Léonie. Whoever did this room. Since there is no dust, the room _must___ have been done this morning. I reconstruct the incident like this. Yesterday, possibly last night, M. Renauld drew a cheque to the order of some one named Duveen. Afterwards it was torn up, and scattered on the floor. This morning—” But M. Bex was already pulling impatiently at the bell. Françoise answered it. Yes, there had been a lot of pieces of paper on the floor. What had she done with them? Put them in the kitchen stove of course! What else? With a gesture of despair, Bex dismissed her. Then, his face lightening, he ran to the desk. In a minute he was hunting through the dead man’s cheque book. Then he repeated his"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,8,"former gesture. The last counterfoil was blank. “Courage!” cried Poirot, clapping him on the back. “Without doubt, Madame Renauld will be able to tell us all about this mysterious person named Duveen.” The commissary’s face cleared. “That is true. Let us proceed.” As we turned to leave the room, Poirot remarked casually: “It was here that M. Renauld received his guest last night, eh?” “It was—but how did you know?” “By _this___. I found it on the back of the leather chair.” And he held up between his finger and thumb a long black hair—a woman’s hair! M. Bex took us out by the back of the house to where there was a small shed leaning against the house. He produced a key from his pocket and unlocked it. “The body is here. We moved it from the scene of the crime just before you arrived, as the photographers had done with it.” He opened the door and we passed in. The murdered man lay on the ground, with a sheet over him. M. Bex dexterously whipped off the covering. Renauld was a man of medium height, slender and lithe in figure. He looked about fifty years of age, and his dark hair was plentifully streaked with grey. He was clean shaven with a long thin nose, and eyes set rather close together, and his skin was deeply bronzed, as"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,9,"that of a man who had spent most of his life beneath tropical skies. His lips were drawn back from his teeth and an expression of absolute amazement and terror was stamped on the livid features. “One can see by his face that he was stabbed in the back,” remarked Poirot. Very gently, he turned the dead man over. There, between the shoulder-blades, staining the light fawn overcoat, was a round dark patch. In the middle of it there was a slit in the cloth. Poirot examined it narrowly. “Have you any idea with what weapon the crime was committed?” “It was left in the wound.” The commissary reached down a large glass jar. In it was a small object that looked to me more like a paper-knife than anything else. It had a black handle, and a narrow shining blade. The whole thing was not more than ten inches long. Poirot tested the discoloured point gingerly with his finger tip. “_Ma foi!___ but it is sharp! A nice easy little tool for murder!” “Unfortunately, we could find no trace of fingerprints on it,” remarked Bex regretfully. “The murderer must have worn gloves.” “Of course he did,” said Poirot contemptuously. “Even in Santiago they know enough for that. The veriest amateur of an English Mees knows it—thanks to the publicity the Bertillon system has been given in the Press. All"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,4,4 The Letter Signed “Bella”,10,"the same, it interests me very much that there were no finger-prints. It is so amazingly simple to leave the finger-prints of some one else! And then the police are happy.” He shook his head. “I very much fear our criminal is not a man of method—either that or he was pressed for time. But we shall see.” He let the body fall back into its original position. “He wore only underclothes under his overcoat, I see,” he remarked. “Yes, the examining magistrate thinks that is rather a curious point.” At this minute there was a tap on the door which Bex had closed after him. He strode forward and opened it. Françoise was there. She endeavoured to peep in with ghoulish curiosity. “Well, what is it?” demanded Bex impatiently. “Madame. She sends a message that she is much recovered, and is quite ready to receive the examining magistrate.” “Good,” said M. Bex briskly. “Tell M. Hautet and say that we will come at once.” Poirot lingered a moment, looking back towards the body. I thought for a moment that he was going to apostrophize it, to declare aloud his determination never to rest till he had discovered the murderer. But when he spoke, it was tamely and awkwardly, and his comment was ludicrously inappropriate to the solemnity of the moment. “He wore his overcoat very long,” he said constrainedly."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,1,"We found M. Hautet awaiting us in the hall, and we all proceeded upstairs together, Françoise marching ahead to show us the way. Poirot went up in a zigzag fashion which puzzled me, until he whispered with a grimace: “No wonder the servants heard M. Renauld mounting the stairs; not a board of them but creaks fit to wake the dead!” At the head of the staircase, a small passage branched off. “The servants’ quarters,” explained Bex. We continued along a corridor, and Françoise tapped on the last door to the right of it. A faint voice bade us enter, and we passed into a large sunny apartment looking out towards the sea, which showed blue and sparkling about a quarter of a mile distant. On a couch, propped up with cushions, and attended by Dr. Durand, lay a tall, striking-looking woman. She was middle-aged, and her once dark hair was now almost entirely silvered, but the intense vitality and strength of her personality would have made itself felt anywhere. You knew at once that you were in the presence of what the French call “_une maitresse femme___.” She greeted us with a dignified inclination of the head. “Pray be seated, monsieurs.” We took chairs, and the magistrate’s clerk established himself at a round table. “I hope, madame,” began M. Hautet, “that it will not distress you unduly to relate to us what occurred last night?” “Not at all, monsieur. I know the value of time, if these scoundrelly assassins are"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,2,"to be caught and punished.” “Very well, madame. It will fatigue you less, I think, if I ask you questions and you confine yourself to answering them. At what time did you go to bed last night?” “At half-past nine, monsieur. I was tired.” “And your husband?” “About an hour later, I fancy.” “Did he seem disturbed—upset in any way?” “No, not more than usual.” “What happened then?” “We slept. I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.” “Can you describe them at all, madame?” “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.” “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.” “You mean they were false?” “Yes, madame. But continue your story.” “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,3,"desperately. “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said. ‘_The secret!___ Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’ “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.” “_Pardon___,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?” “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,4,"agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound—and you are a dead man, remember.’ “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.” “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?” “None whatever, monsieur.” “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?” “Yes. I had seen the change in him.” “How long ago was that?” Mrs. Renauld reflected. “Ten days perhaps.” “Not longer?” “Possibly. I only noticed it then.” “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?” “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.” “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?” “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised. “Yes, this gentleman—M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,5,"his pocket he handed it to the lady. She read it with apparently genuine astonishment. “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.” “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?” Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head. “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident—only that I am not aware of it.” The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately. “And you can fix the time of this outrage?” “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece. Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied. “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.” Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction. “_Mon Dieu!___” he ejaculated. “What is it?” “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!” “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished. But Poirot,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,6,"deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled. “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.” The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point. “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?” “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?” Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly. “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.” With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory. “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?” “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.” “Is that a likely thing to happen?” “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.” There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her. “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,7,"distance away.” The magistrate nodded. “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.” “What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot. “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.” “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen. “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.” He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld: “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?” “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.” “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?” “Never.” “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?” He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions. “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?” Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly. “No, who was that?” “A lady.” “Indeed?” But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,8,"Mrs. Renauld more than necessary. He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger. “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?” She gave a little cry. “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then—she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that—blood?” “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?” “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.” “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.” “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.” “What?” “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,9,"last night, and he wired him to catch it.” “Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?” “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.” And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed: “Santiago! Again Santiago!” It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the mention of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow. “_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.” Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared. “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled. But the magistrate was speaking excitedly. “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused. “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,5,5 Mrs. Renauld’s Story,10,"of my husband’s body?” The magistrate bowed his head. “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready—now.” “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you—” “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?” The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen. She raised her hand to her face. “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.” She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her. “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground. Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside. He caught me by the arm. “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. _Eh bien!___ I must start again!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,1,"Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head. “_Pauvre femme___,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?” “If you please, M. Bex.” We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken the dead!” “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.” But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house. “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.” “But all"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,2,"the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary. Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor. “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.” “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.” I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed. “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.” Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere. Poirot"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,3,"nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed. “M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.” The commissary joined him—and smiled. “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.” “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?” “Not the least in the world.” Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words: “I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.” M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion. “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead. “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully. Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,4,"incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment. “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried. Bex nodded. “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.” I gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had overlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was the body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I had a wild fancy that the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,5,"tragedy had been duplicated. But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance: “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!” The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder. “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet. “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.” As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity. The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye. “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,6,"a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.” “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently. I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself. “The examining magistrate—” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely: “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.” “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.” The other grunted disgustedly. “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge—but they were"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,7,"cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.” “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?” The other detective stared. “Of course.” A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying. “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who used it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re Renauld’s too—or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always _something!___ And I mean to find it.” But Poirot was now apparently"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,8,"interested in something else, a short discoloured piece of lead-piping which lay beside the spade. He touched it delicately with his finger. “And does this, too, belong to the murdered man?” he asked, and I thought I detected a subtle flavour of irony in the question. Giraud shrugged his shoulders to indicate that he neither knew nor cared. “May have been lying around here for weeks. Anyway, it doesn’t interest me.” “I, on the contrary, find it very interesting,” said Poirot sweetly. I guessed that he was merely bent on annoying the Paris detective and, if so, he succeeded. The other turned away rudely, remarking that he had no time to waste, and bending down he resumed his minute search of the ground. Meanwhile Poirot, as though struck by a sudden idea, stepped back over the boundary, and tried the door of the little shed. “That’s locked,” said Giraud over his shoulder. “But it’s only a place where the gardener keeps his rubbish. The spade didn’t come from there, but from the toolshed up by the house.” “Marvellous,” murmured M. Bex, to me ecstatically. “He has been here but half an hour, and"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,9,"he already knows everything! What a man! Undoubtedly Giraud is the greatest detective alive today.” Although I disliked the detective heartily, I nevertheless was secretly impressed. Efficiency seemed to radiate from the man. I could not help feeling that, so far, Poirot had not greatly distinguished himself, and it vexed me. He seemed to be directing his attention to all sorts of silly, puerile points that had nothing to do with the case. Indeed, at this juncture, he suddenly asked: “M. Bex, tell me, I pray you, the meaning of this whitewashed line that extends all round the grave. Is it a device of the police?” “No, M. Poirot, it is an affair of the golf course. It shows that there is here to be a ‘bunkair,’ as you call it.” “A bunkair?” Poirot turned to me. “That is the irregular hole filled with sand and a bank at one side, is it not?” I concurred. “You do not play the golf, M. Poirot?” inquired Bex. “I? Never! What a game!” He became excited. “Figure to yourself, each hole it is of a different length. The obstacles, they are not arranged mathematically. Even"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,6,6 The Scene of the Crime,10,"the greens are frequently up one side! There is only one pleasing thing—the how do you call them?—tee boxes! They, at least, are symmetrical.” I could not refrain from a laugh at the way the game appeared to Poirot, and my little friend smiled at me affectionately, bearing no malice. Then he asked: “But M. Renauld, without doubt he played the golf?” “Yes, he was a keen golfer. It’s mainly owing to him, and to his large subscriptions, that this work is being carried forward. He even had a say in the designing of it.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. Then he remarked: “It was not a very good choice they made—of a spot to bury the body? When the men began to dig up the ground, all would have been discovered.” “Exactly,” cried Giraud triumphantly. “And that _proves___ that they were strangers to the place. It’s an excellent piece of indirect evidence.” “Yes,” said Poirot doubtfully. “No one who knew would bury a body there—unless—unless—they _wanted___ it to be discovered. And that is clearly absurd, is it not?” Giraud did not even trouble to reply. “Yes,” said Poirot, in a somewhat dissatisfied voice. “Yes—undoubtedly—absurd!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,1,"As we retraced our steps to the house, M. Bex excused himself for leaving us, explaining that he must immediately acquaint the examining magistrate with the fact of Giraud’s arrival. Giraud himself had been obviously delighted when Poirot declared that he had seen all he wanted. The last thing we observed, as we left the spot, was Giraud, crawling about on all fours, with a thoroughness in his search that I could not but admire. Poirot guessed my thoughts, for as soon as we were alone he remarked ironically: “At last you have seen the detective you admire—the human foxhound! Is it not so, my friend?” “At any rate, he’s _doing___ something,” I said, with asperity. “If there’s anything to find, he’ll find it. Now you—” “_Eh bien!___ I also have found something! A piece of lead-piping.” “Nonsense, Poirot. You know very well that’s got nothing to do with it. I meant _little___ things—traces that may lead us infallibly to the murderers.” “_Mon ami___, a clue of two feet long is every bit as valuable as one measuring two millimetres! But it is the romantic idea that all important clues must be infinitesimal! As to the piece of lead-piping having nothing to do with the crime, you say that because Giraud told you so. No”—as I was about to interpose a question—“we will say no more. Leave Giraud to his search, and me to my ideas. The case seems straightforward enough—and yet—and yet, _mon ami___, I am not satisfied! And do you know why? Because of the wrist watch that is two hours fast. And then there are several curious little points that do not seem to fit in. For instance, if the object of the murderers was revenge, why did they not stab Renauld in his sleep and have done with it?” “They wanted the ‘secret,’” I reminded him. Poirot brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve with a dissatisfied air."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,2,"“Well, where is this ‘secret’? Presumably some distance away, since they wish him to dress himself. Yet he is found murdered close at hand, almost within ear-shot of the house. Then again, it is pure chance that a weapon such as the dagger should be lying about casually, ready to hand.” He paused frowning, and then went on: “Why did the servants hear nothing? Were they drugged? Was there an accomplice and did that accomplice see to it that the front door should remain open? I wonder if—” He stopped abruptly. We had reached the drive in front of the house. Suddenly he turned to me. “My friend, I am about to surprise you—to please you! I have taken your reproaches to heart! We will examine some footprints!” “Where?” “In that right-hand bed yonder. M. Bex says that they are the footmarks of the gardener. Let us see if that is so. See, he approaches with his wheelbarrow.” Indeed an elderly man was just crossing the drive with a barrowful of seedlings. Poirot called to him, and he set down the barrow and came hobbling towards us. “You are going to ask him for one of his boots to compare with the footmarks?” I asked breathlessly. My faith in Poirot revived a little. Since he said the footprints in this right-hand bed were important, presumably they _were___. “Exactly,” said Poirot. “But won’t he think it very odd?” “He will not think about it at all.” We could say no more, for the old man had joined us. “You want me for something, monsieur?” “Yes. You have been gardener here a long time, haven’t you?” “Twenty-four years, monsieur.” “And your name is—?” “Auguste, monsieur.” “I was admiring these magnificent geraniums. They are truly superb. They have been planted long?” “Some time, monsieur. But of course, to keep the beds looking smart, one must keep bedding out a few new plants, and remove those that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,3,"are over, besides keeping the old blooms well picked off.” “You put in some new plants yesterday, didn’t you? Those in the middle there, and in the other bed also?” “Monsieur has a sharp eye. It takes always a day or so for them to ‘pick up.’ Yes, I put ten new plants in each bed last night. As Monsieur doubtless knows, one should not put in plants when the sun is hot.” Auguste was charmed with Poirot’s interest, and was quite inclined to be garrulous. “That is a splendid specimen there,” said Poirot, pointing. “Might I perhaps have a cutting of it?” “But certainly, monsieur.” The old fellow stepped into the bed, and carefully took a slip from the plant Poirot had admired. Poirot was profuse in his thanks, and Auguste departed to his barrow. “You see?” said Poirot with a smile, as he bent over the bed to examine the indentation of the gardener’s hobnailed boot. “It is quite simple.” “I did not realize—” “That the foot would be inside the boot? You do not use your excellent mental capacities sufficiently. Well, what of the footmark?” I examined the bed carefully. “All the footmarks in the bed were made by the same boot,” I said at length after a careful study. “You think so? _Eh bien___, I agree with you,” said Poirot. He seemed quite uninterested, and as though he were thinking of something else. “At any rate,” I remarked, “you will have one bee less in your bonnet now.” “_Mon Dieu!___ But what an idiom! What does it mean?” “What I meant was that now you will give up your interest in these footmarks.” But to my surprise Poirot shook his head. “No, no, _mon ami___. At last I am on the right track. I am still in the dark, but, as I hinted just now to M. Bex, these footmarks are the most important and interesting things in the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,4,"case! That poor Giraud—I should not be surprised if he took no notice of them whatever.” At that moment, the front door opened, and M. Hautet and the commissary came down the steps. “Ah, M. Poirot, we were coming to look for you,” said the magistrate. “It is getting late, but I wish to pay a visit to Madame Daubreuil. Without doubt she will be very much upset by M. Renauld’s death, and we may be fortunate enough to get a clue from her. The secret that he did not confide to his wife, it is possible that he may have told it to the woman whose love held him enslaved. We know where our Samsons are weak, don’t we?” I admired the picturesqueness of M. Hautet’s language. I suspected that the examining magistrate was by now thoroughly enjoying his part in the mysterious drama. “Is M. Giraud not going to accompany us?” asked Poirot. “M. Giraud has shown clearly that he prefers to conduct the case in his own way,” said M. Hautet dryly. One could see easily enough that Giraud’s cavalier treatment of the examining magistrate had not prejudiced the latter in his favour. We said no more, but fell into line. Poirot walked with the examining magistrate, and the commissary and I followed a few paces behind. “There is no doubt that Françoise’s story is substantially correct,” he remarked to me in a confidential tone. “I have been telephoning headquarters. It seems that three times in the last six weeks—that is to say since the arrival of M. Renauld at Merlinville—Madame Daubreuil has paid a large sum in notes into her banking account. Altogether the sum totals two hundred thousand francs!” “Dear me,” I said, considering, “that must be something like four thousand pounds!” “Precisely. Yes, there can be no doubt that he was absolutely infatuated. But it remains to be seen whether he confided his secret to her."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,5,"The examining magistrate is hopeful, but I hardly share his views.” During this conversation we were walking down the lane towards the fork in the road where our car had halted earlier in the afternoon, and in another moment I realized that the Villa Marguerite, the home of the mysterious Madame Daubreuil, was the small house from which the beautiful girl had emerged. “She has lived here for many years,” said the commissary, nodding his head towards the house. “Very quietly, very unobtrusively. She seems to have no friends or relations other than the acquaintances she has made in Merlinville. She never refers to the past, nor to her husband. One does not even know if he is alive or dead. There is a mystery about her, you comprehend.” I nodded, my interest growing. “And—the daughter?” I ventured. “A truly beautiful young girl—modest, devout, all that she should be. One pities her, for, though she may know nothing of the past, a man who wants to ask her hand in marriage must necessarily inform himself, and then—” The commissary shrugged his shoulders cynically. “But it would not be her fault!” I cried, with rising indignation. “No. But what will you? A man is particular about his wife’s antecedents.” I was prevented from further argument by our arrival at the door. M. Hautet rang the bell. A few minutes elapsed, and then we heard a footfall within, and the door was opened. On the threshold stood my young goddess of that afternoon. When she saw us, the colour left her cheeks, leaving her deathly white, and her eyes widened with apprehension. There was no doubt about it, she was afraid! “Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” said M. Hautet, sweeping off his hat, “we regret infinitely to disturb you, but the exigencies of the Law—you comprehend? My compliments to Madame your mother, and will she have the goodness to grant me a few moments’ interview.” For a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,6,"moment the girl stood motionless. Her left hand was pressed to her side, as though to still the sudden unconquerable agitation of her heart. But she mastered herself, and said in a low voice: “I will go and see. Please come inside.” She entered a room on the left of the hall, and we heard the low murmur of her voice. And then another voice, much the same in timbre, but with a slightly harder inflection behind its mellow roundness said: “But certainly. Ask them to enter.” In another minute we were face to face with the mysterious Madame Daubreuil. She was not nearly so tall as her daughter, and the rounded curves of her figure had all the grace of full maturity. Her hair, again unlike her daughter’s, was dark, and parted in the middle in the madonna style. Her eyes, half hidden by the drooping lids, were blue. There was a dimple in the round chin, and the half parted lips seemed always to hover on the verge of a mysterious smile. There was something almost exaggeratedly feminine about her, at once yielding and seductive. Though very well preserved, she was certainly no longer young, but her charm was of the quality which is independent of age. Standing there, in her black dress with the fresh white collar and cuffs, her hands clasped together, she looked subtly appealing and helpless. “You wished to see me, monsieur?” she asked. “Yes, madame.” M. Hautet cleared his throat. “I am investigating the death of M. Renauld. You have heard of it, no doubt?” She bowed her head without speaking. Her expression did not change. “We came to ask you whether you can—er—throw any light upon the circumstances surrounding it?” “I?” The surprise of her tone was excellent. “Yes, madame. It would, perhaps, be better if we could speak to you alone.” He looked meaningly in the direction of the girl. Madame Daubreuil turned"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,7,"to her. “Marthe, dear—” But the girl shook her head. “No, _maman___, I will not go. I am not a child. I am twenty-two. I shall not go.” Madame Daubreuil turned back to the examining magistrate. “You see, monsieur.” “I should prefer not to speak before Mademoiselle Daubreuil.” “As my daughter says, she is not a child.” For a moment the magistrate hesitated, baffled. “Very well, madame,” he said at last. “Have it your own way. We have reason to believe that you were in the habit of visiting the dead man at his Villa in the evenings. Is that so?” The colour rose in the lady’s pale cheeks, but she replied quietly: “I deny your right to ask me such a question!” “Madame, we are investigating a murder.” “Well, what of it? I had nothing to do with the murder.” “Madame, we do not say that for a moment. But you knew the dead man well. Did he ever confide in you as to any danger that threatened him?” “Never.” “Did he ever mention his life in Santiago, and any enemies he may have made there?” “No.” “Then you can give us no help at all?” “I fear not. I really do not see why you should come to me. Cannot his wife tell you what you want to know?” Her voice held a slender inflection of irony. “Madame Renauld has told us all she can.” “Ah!” said Madame Daubreuil. “I wonder—” “You wonder what, madame?” “Nothing.” The examining magistrate looked at her. He was aware that he was fighting a duel, and that he had no mean antagonist. “You persist in your statement that M. Renauld confided nothing in you?” “Why should you think it likely that he should confide in me?” “Because, madame,” said M. Hautet, with calculated brutality. “A man tells to his mistress what he does not always tell to his wife.” “Ah!” she sprang forward. Her"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,8,"eyes flashed fire. “Monsieur, you insult me! And before my daughter! I can tell you nothing. Have the goodness to leave my house!” The honours undoubtedly rested with the lady. We left the Villa Marguerite like a shamefaced pack of schoolboys. The magistrate muttered angry ejaculations to himself. Poirot seemed lost in thought. Suddenly he came out of his reverie with a start, and inquired of M. Hautet if there was a good hotel near at hand. “There is a small place, the Hotel des Bains, on this side of town. A few hundred yards down the road. It will be handy for your investigations. We shall see you in the morning then, I presume?” “Yes, I thank you, M. Hautet.” With mutual civilities, we parted company, Poirot and I going towards Merlinville, and the others returning to the Villa Geneviève. “The French police system is very marvellous,” said Poirot, looking after them. “The information they possess about every one’s life, down to the most commonplace detail, is extraordinary. Though he has only been here a little over six weeks, they are perfectly well acquainted with M. Renauld’s tastes and pursuits, and at a moment’s notice they can produce information as to Madame Daubreuil’s banking account, and the sums that have lately been paid in! Undoubtedly the _dossier___ is a great institution. But what is that?” He turned sharply. A figure was running hatless, down the road after us. It was Marthe Daubreuil. “I beg your pardon,” she cried breathlessly, as she reached us. “I—I should not do this, I know. You must not tell my mother. But is it true, what the people say, that M. Renauld called in a detective before he died, and—and that you are he?” “Yes, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “It is quite true. But how did you learn it?” “Françoise told our Amélie,” explained Marthe, with a blush. Poirot made a grimace. “The secrecy, it is"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,9,"impossible in an affair of this kind! Not that it matters. Well, mademoiselle, what is it you want to know?” The girl hesitated. She seemed longing, yet fearing, to speak. At last, almost in a whisper, she asked: “Is—any one suspected?” Poirot eyed her keenly. Then he replied evasively: “Suspicion is in the air at present, mademoiselle.” “Yes, I know—but—any one in particular?” “Why do you want to know?” The girl seemed frightened by the question. All at once Poirot’s words about her earlier in the day recurred to me. The “girl with the anxious eyes!” “M. Renauld was always very kind to me,” she replied at last. “It is natural that I should be interested.” “I see,” said Poirot. “Well, mademoiselle, suspicion at present is hovering round two persons.” “Two?” I could have sworn there was a note of surprise and relief in her voice. “Their names are unknown, but they are presumed to be Chilians from Santiago. And now, mademoiselle, you see what comes of being young and beautiful! I have betrayed professional secrets for you!” The girl laughed merrily, and then, rather shyly, she thanked him. “I must run back now. _Maman___ will miss me.” And she turned and ran back up the road, looking like a modern Atalanta. I stared after her. “_Mon ami___,” said Poirot, in his gentle ironical voice, “is it that we are to remain planted here all night—just because you have seen a beautiful young woman, and your head is in a whirl?” I laughed and apologized. “But she _is___ beautiful, Poirot. Any one might be excused for being bowled over by her.” Poirot groaned. “_Mon Dieu!___ But it is that you have the susceptible heart!” “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember after the Styles Case when—” “When you were in love with two charming women at once, and neither of them were for you? Yes, I remember.” “You consoled me by saying that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,7,7 The Mysterious Madame Daubreuil,10,"perhaps some day we should hunt together again, and that then—” “_Eh bien?___” “Well, we are hunting together again, and—” I paused, and laughed rather self-consciously. But to my surprise Poirot shook his head very earnestly. “Ah, _mon ami___, do not set your heart on Marthe Daubreuil. She is not for you, that one! Take it from Papa Poirot!” “Why,” I cried, “the commissary assured me that she was as good as she is beautiful! A perfect angel!” “Some of the greatest criminals I have known had the faces of angels,” remarked Poirot cheerfully. “A malformation of the grey cells may coincide quite easily with the face of a madonna.” “Poirot,” I cried, horrified, “you cannot mean that you suspect an innocent child like this!” “Ta-ta-ta! Do not excite yourself! I have not said that I suspected her. But you must admit that her anxiety to know about the case is somewhat unusual.” “For once, I see further than you do,” I said. “Her anxiety is not for herself—but for her mother.” “My friend,” said Poirot, “as usual, you see nothing at all. Madame Daubreuil is very well able to look after herself without her daughter worrying about her. I admit I was teasing you just now, but all the same I repeat what I said before. Do not set your heart on that girl. She is not for you! I, Hercule Poirot, know it. _Sacré!___ if only I could remember where I had seen that face!” “What face?” I asked, surprised. “The daughter’s?” “No. The mother’s.” Noting my surprise, he nodded emphatically. “But yes—it is as I tell you. It was a long time ago, when I was still with the Police in Belgium. I have never actually seen the woman before, but I have seen her picture—and in connection with some case. I rather fancy—” “Yes?” “I may be mistaken, but I rather fancy that it was a murder case!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,1,"We were up at the Villa betimes next morning. The man on guard at the gate did not bar our way this time. Instead, he respectfully saluted us, and we passed on to the house. The maid Léonie was just coming down the stairs, and seemed not averse to the prospect of a little conversation. Poirot inquired after the health of Mrs. Renauld. Léonie shook her head. “She is terribly upset, _la pauvre dame!___ She will eat nothing—but nothing! And she is as pale as a ghost. It is heartrending to see her. Ah, _par exemple___, it is not I who would grieve like that for a man who had deceived me with another woman!” Poirot nodded sympathetically. “What you say is very just, but what will you? The heart of a woman who loves will forgive many blows. Still, undoubtedly there must have been many scenes of recrimination between them in the last few months?” Again Léonie shook her head. “Never, monsieur. Never have I heard Madame utter a word of protest—of reproach, even! She had the temper and disposition of an angel—quite different to Monsieur.” “Monsieur Renauld had not the temper of an angel?” “Far from it. When he enraged himself, the whole house knew of it. The day that he quarrelled with M. Jack—_ma foi!___ they might have been heard in the market place, they shouted so loud!” “Indeed,” said Poirot. “And when did this quarrel take place?” “Oh! it was just before M. Jack went to Paris. Almost he missed his train. He came out of the library, and caught up his bag which he had left in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,2,"the hall. The automobile, it was being repaired, and he had to run for the station. I was dusting the salon, and I saw him pass, and his face was white—white—with two burning spots of red. Ah, but he was angry!” Léonie was enjoying her narrative thoroughly. “And the dispute, what was it about?” “Ah, that I do not know,” confessed Léonie. “It is true that they shouted, but their voices were so loud and high, and they spoke so fast, that only one well acquainted with English could have comprehended. But Monsieur, he was like a thundercloud all day! Impossible to please him!” The sound of a door shutting upstairs cut short Léonie’s loquacity. “And Françoise who awaits me!” she exclaimed, awakening to a tardy remembrance of her duties. “That old one, she always scolds.” “One moment, mademoiselle. The examining magistrate, where is he?” “They have gone out to look at the automobile in the garage. Monsieur the commissary had some idea that it might have been used on the night of the murder.” “_Quelle idée___,” murmured Poirot, as the girl disappeared. “You will go out and join them?” “No, I shall await their return in the _salon___. It is cool there on this hot morning.” This placid way of taking things did not quite commend itself to me. “If you don’t mind—” I said, and hesitated. “Not in the least. You wish to investigate on your own account, eh?” “Well, I’d rather like to have a look at Giraud, if he’s anywhere about, and see what he’s up to.” “The human foxhound,” murmured Poirot, as he leaned back in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,3,"a comfortable chair, and closed his eyes. “By all means, my friend. Au revoir.” I strolled out of the front door. It was certainly hot. I turned up the path we had taken the day before. I had a mind to study the scene of the crime myself. I did not go directly to the spot, however, but turned aside into the bushes, so as to come out on the links some hundred yards or so further to the right. If Giraud were still on the spot, I wanted to observe his methods before he knew of my presence. But the shrubbery here was much denser, and I had quite a struggle to force my way through. When I emerged at last on the course, it was quite unexpectedly and with such vigour that I cannoned heavily into a young lady who had been standing with her back to the plantation. She not unnaturally gave a suppressed shriek, but I, too, uttered an exclamation of surprise. For it was my friend of the train, Cinderella! The surprise was mutual. “You,” we both exclaimed simultaneously. The young lady recovered herself first. “My only Aunt!” she exclaimed. “What are you doing here?” “For the matter of that, what are you?” I retorted. “When last I saw you, the day before yesterday, you were trotting home to England like a good little boy. Have they given you a season ticket to and fro, on the strength of your M.P.?” I ignored the end of the speech. “When last I saw you,” I said, “you were trotting home with your sister, like a good little"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,4,"girl. By the way, how is your sister?” A flash of white teeth rewarded me. “How kind of you to ask! My sister is well, I thank you.” “She is here with you?” “She remained in town,” said the minx with dignity. “I don’t believe you’ve got a sister,” I laughed. “If you have, her name is Harris!” “Do you remember mine?” she asked, with a smile. “Cinderella. But you’re going to tell me the real one now, aren’t you?” She shook her head with a wicked look. “Not even why you’re here?” “Oh, that! I suppose you’ve heard of members of my profession ‘resting.’” “At expensive French watering-places?” “Dirt cheap if you know where to go.” I eyed her keenly. “Still, you’d no intention of coming here when I met you two days ago?” “We all have our disappointments,” said Miss Cinderella sententiously. “There now, I’ve told you quite as much as is good for you. Little boys should not be inquisitive. You’ve not yet told me what you’re doing here? Got the M.P. in tow, I suppose, doing the gay boy on the beach.” I shook my head. “Guess again. You remember my telling you that my great friend was a detective?” “Yes?” “And perhaps you’ve heard about this crime—at the Villa Geneviève—?” She stared at me. Her breast heaved, and her eyes grew wide and round. “You don’t mean—that you’re in on _that?___” I nodded. There was no doubt that I had scored heavily. Her emotion, as she regarded me, was only too evident. For some few seconds, she remained silent, staring at me. Then she nodded her"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,5,"head emphatically. “Well, if that doesn’t beat the band! Tote me round. I want to see all the horrors.” “What do you mean?” “What I say. Bless the boy, didn’t I tell you I doted on crimes? What do you think I’m imperilling my ankles for in high-heeled shoes over this stubble? I’ve been nosing round for hours. Tried the front way in, but that old stick-in-the-mud of a French gendarme wasn’t taking any. I guess Helen of Troy, and Cleopatra, and Mary, Queen of Scots, rolled in one wouldn’t cut ice with him! It’s a real piece of luck happening on you this way. Come on, show me all the sights.” “But look here—wait a minute—I can’t. Nobody’s allowed in. They’re awfully strict.” “Aren’t you and your friend the big bugs?” I was loath to relinquish my position of importance. “Why are you so keen?” I asked weakly. “And what is it you want to see.” “Oh, everything! The place where it happened, and the weapon, and the body, and any finger-prints or interesting things like that. I’ve never had a chance of being right in on a murder like this before. It’ll last me all my life?” I turned away, sickened. What were women coming to nowadays? The girl’s ghoulish excitement nauseated me. I had read of the mobs of women who besieged the law courts when some wretched man was being tried for his life on the capital charge. I had sometimes wondered who these women were. Now I knew. They were of the likeness of Cinderella, young, yet obsessed with a yearning for morbid excitement, for sensation"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,6,"at any price, without regard to any decency or good feeling. The vividness of the girl’s beauty had attracted me in spite of myself, yet at heart I retained my first impression of disapproval and dislike. I thought of my mother, long since dead. What would she have said of this strange modern product of girlhood? The pretty face with the paint and powder, and the ghoulish mind behind! “Come off your high horse,” said the lady suddenly. “And don’t give yourself airs. When you got called to this job, did you put your nose in the air and say it was a nasty business, and you wouldn’t be mixed up in it?” “No, but—” “If you’d been here on a holiday, wouldn’t you be nosing round just the same as I am? Of course you would.” “I’m a man. You’re a woman.” “Your idea of a woman is some one who gets on a chair and shrieks if she sees a mouse. That’s all prehistoric. But you _will___ show me round, won’t you? You see, it might make a big difference to me.” “In what way?” “They’re keeping all the reporters out. I might make a big scoop with one of the papers. You don’t know how much they pay for a bit of inside stuff.” I hesitated. She slipped a small soft hand into mine. “_Please___—there’s a dear.” I capitulated. Secretly, I knew that I should rather enjoy the part of showman. After all, the moral attitude displayed by the girl was none of my business. I was a little nervous as to what the examining magistrate might say,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,7,"but I reassured myself by the reflection that no harm could possibly be done. We repaired first to the spot where the body had been discovered. A man was on guard there, who saluted respectfully, knowing me by sight, and raised no question as to my companion. Presumably he regarded her as vouched for by me. I explained to Cinderella just how the discovery had been made, and she listened attentively, sometimes putting an intelligent question. Then we turned our steps in the direction of the Villa. I proceeded rather cautiously, for, truth to tell, I was not at all anxious to meet any one. I took the girl through the shrubbery round to the back of the house where the small shed was. I recollected that yesterday evening, after relocking the door, M. Bex had left the key with the _sergent de ville___ Marchaud, “in case M. Giraud should require it while we are upstairs.” I thought it quite likely that the Sûreté detective, after using it, had returned it to Marchaud again. Leaving the girl out of sight in the shrubbery, I entered the house. Marchaud was on duty outside the door of the _salon___. From within came the murmur of voices. “Monsieur desires Hautet? He is within. He is again interrogating Françoise.” “No,” I said hastily, “I don’t want him. But I should very much like the key of the shed outside if it is not against regulations.” “But certainly, monsieur.” He produced it. “Here it is. M. le juge gave orders that all facilities were to be placed at your disposal. You will return it to me"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,8,"when you have finished out there, that is all.” “Of course.” I felt a thrill of satisfaction as I realized that in Marchaud’s eyes, at least, I ranked equally in importance with Poirot. The girl was waiting for me. She gave an exclamation of delight as she saw the key in my hand. “You’ve got it then?” “Of course,” I said coolly. “All the same, you know, what I’m doing is highly irregular.” “You’ve been a perfect duck, and I shan’t forget it. Come along. They can’t see us from the house, can they?” “Wait a minute.” I arrested her eager advance. “I won’t stop you if you really wish to go in. But do you? You’ve seen the grave, and the grounds, and you’ve heard all the details of the affair. Isn’t that enough for you? This is going to be gruesome, you know, and—unpleasant.” She looked at me for a moment with an expression that I could not quite fathom. Then she laughed. “Me for the horrors,” she said. “Come along.” In silence we arrived at the door of the shed. I opened it and we passed in. I walked over to the body, and gently pulled down the sheet as M. Bex had done the preceding afternoon. A little gasping sound escaped from the girl’s lips, and I turned and looked at her. There was horror on her face now, and those debonair high spirits of hers were quenched utterly. She had not chosen to listen to my advice, and she was punished now for her disregard of it. I felt singularly merciless towards her. She should go"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,9,"through with it now. I turned the corpse gently over. “You see,” I said, “he was stabbed in the back.” Her voice was almost soundless. “With what?” I nodded towards the glass jar. “That dagger.” Suddenly the girl reeled, and then sank down in a heap. I sprang to her assistance. “You are faint. Come out of here. It has been too much for you.” “Water,” she murmured. “Quick. Water.…” I left her, and rushed into the house. Fortunately none of the servants were about, and I was able to secure a glass of water unobserved and add a few drops of brandy from a pocket flask. In a few minutes I was back again. The girl was lying as I had left her, but a few sips of the brandy and water revived her in a marvellous manner. “Take me out of here—oh, quickly, quickly!” she cried, shuddering. Supporting her with my arm I led her out into the air, and she pulled the door to behind her. Then she drew a deep breath. “That’s better. Oh, it was horrible! Why did you ever let me go in?” I felt this to be so feminine that I could not forbear a smile. Secretly, I was not dissatisfied with her collapse. It proved that she was not quite so callous as I had thought her. After all she was little more than a child, and her curiosity had probably been of the unthinking order. “I did my best to stop you, you know,” I said gently. “I suppose you did. Well, good-bye.” “Look here, you can’t start off like that—all alone."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,8,8 An Unexpected Meeting,10,"You’re not fit for it. I insist on accompanying you back to Merlinville.” “Nonsense. I’m quite all right now.” “Supposing you felt faint again? No, I shall come with you.” But this she combated with a good deal of energy. In the end, however, I prevailed so far as to be allowed to accompany her to the outskirts of the town. We retraced our steps over our former route, passing the grave again, and making a detour on to the road. Where the first straggling line of shops began, she stopped and held out her hand. “Good-bye, and thank you ever so much for coming with me.” “Are you sure you’re all right now?” “Quite, thanks. I hope you won’t get into any trouble over showing me things?” I disclaimed the idea lightly. “Well, good-bye.” “Au revoir,” I corrected. “If you’re staying here, we shall meet again.” She flashed a smile at me. “That’s so. Au revoir, then.” “Wait a second, you haven’t told me your address?” “Oh, I’m staying at the Hôtel du Phare. It’s a little place, but quite good. Come and look me up tomorrow.” “I will,” I said, with perhaps rather unnecessary _empressement___. I watched her out of sight, then turned and retraced my steps to the Villa. I remembered that I had not relocked the door of the shed. Fortunately no one had noticed the oversight, and turning the key I removed it and returned it to the _sergent de ville___. And, as I did so, it came upon me suddenly that though Cinderella had given me her address I still did not know her name."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,1,"In the _Salon___ I found the examining magistrate busily interrogating the old gardener Auguste. Poirot and the commissary, who were both present, greeted me respectively with a smile and a polite bow. I slipped quietly into a seat. M. Hautet was painstaking and meticulous in the extreme, but did not succeed in eliciting anything of importance. The gardening gloves Auguste admitted to be his. He wore them when handling a certain species of primula plant which was poisonous to some people. He could not say when he had worn them last. Certainly he had not missed them. Where were they kept? Sometimes in one place, sometimes in another. The spade was usually to be found in the small tool shed. Was it locked? Of course it was locked. Where was the key kept? _Parbleu___, it was in the door of course! There was nothing of value to steal. Who would have expected a party of bandits, of assassins? Such things did not happen in Madame la Vicomtesse’s time. M. Hautet signifying that he had finished with him, the old man withdrew, grumbling to the last. Remembering Poirot’s unaccountable insistence on the footprints in the flower beds, I scrutinized him narrowly as he gave his evidence."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,2,"Either he had nothing to do with the crime or he was a consummate actor. Suddenly, just as he was going out of the door, an idea struck me. “_Pardon___ M. Hautet,” I cried, “but will you permit me to ask him one question?” “But certainly, monsieur.” Thus encouraged, I turned to Auguste. “Where do you keep your boots?” “_Sac à papier!___” growled the old man. “On my feet. Where else?” “But when you go to bed at night?” “Under my bed.” “But who cleans them?” “Nobody. Why should they be cleaned? Is it that I promenade myself on the front like a young man? On Sunday I wear the Sunday boots, _bien entendu___, but otherwise—!” he shrugged his shoulders. I shook my head, discouraged. “Well, well,” said the magistrate. “We do not advance very much. Undoubtedly we are held up until we get the return cable from Santiago. Has any one seen Giraud? In verity that one lacks politeness! I have a very good mind to send for him and—” “You will not have to send far, M. le juge.” The quiet voice startled us. Giraud was standing outside looking in through the open window. He leaped lightly into the room, and advanced to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,3,"the table. “Here I am, M. le juge, at your service. Accept my excuses for not presenting myself sooner.” “Not at all. Not at all,” said the magistrate, rather confused. “Of course I am only a detective,” continued the other. “I know nothing of interrogatories. Were I conducting one, I should be inclined to do so without an open window. Any one standing outside can so easily hear all that passes.… But no matter.” M. Hautet flushed angrily. There was evidently going to be no love lost between the examining magistrate and the detective in charge of the case. They had fallen foul of each other at the start. Perhaps in any event it would have been much the same. To Giraud, all examining magistrates were fools, and to M. Hautet who took himself seriously, the casual manner of the Paris detective could not fail to give offence. “_Eh bien___, M. Giraud,” said the magistrate rather sharply. “Without doubt you have been employing your time to a marvel? You have the names of the assassins for us, have you not? And also the precise spot where they find themselves now?” Unmoved by this irony, Giraud replied: “I know at least where they have come from.”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,4,"“_Comment?___” Giraud took two small objects from his pocket and laid them down on the table. We crowded round. The objects were very simple ones: the stub of a cigarette, and an unlighted match. The detective wheeled round on Poirot. “What do you see there?” he asked. There was something almost brutal in his tone. It made my cheeks flush. But Poirot remained unmoved. He shrugged his shoulders. “A cigarette end, and a match.” “And what does that tell you?” Poirot spread out his hands. “It tells me—nothing.” “Ah!” said Giraud, in a satisfied voice. “You haven’t made a study of these things. That’s not an ordinary match—not in this country at least. It’s common enough in South America. Luckily it’s unlighted. I mightn’t have recognized it otherwise. Evidently one of the men threw away his cigarette end, and lit another, spilling one match out of the box as he did so.” “And the other match?” asked Poirot. “Which match?” “The one he _did___ light his cigarette with. You have found that also?” “No.” “Perhaps you didn’t search very thoroughly.” “Not search thoroughly—” For a moment it seemed as though the detective were going to break out angrily, but with an effort he controlled himself."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,5,"“I see you love a joke, M. Poirot. But in any case, match or no match, the cigarette end would be sufficient. It is a South American cigarette with liquorice pectoral paper.” Poirot bowed. The commissary spoke: “The cigarette end and match might have belonged to M. Renauld. Remember, it is only two years since he returned from South America.” “No,” replied the other confidently. “I have already searched among the effects of M. Renauld. The cigarettes he smoked and the matches he used are quite different.” “You do not think it odd,” asked Poirot, “that these strangers should come unprovided with a weapon, with gloves, with a spade, and that they should so conveniently find all these things?” Giraud smiled in a rather superior manner. “Undoubtedly it is strange. Indeed, without the theory that I hold, it would be inexplicable.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet. “An accomplice. An accomplice within the house!” “Or outside it,” said Giraud with a peculiar smile. “But some one must have admitted them? We cannot allow that, by an unparalleled piece of good fortune, they found the door ajar for them to walk in?” “_D’accord___, M. le juge. The door was opened for them, but it could just as easily"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,6,"be opened from outside—by some one who possessed a key.” “But who did possess a key?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “As for that, no one who possesses one is going to admit the fact if they can help it. But several people _might___ have had one. M. Jack Renauld, the son, for instance. It is true that he is on his way to South America, but he might have lost the key or had it stolen from him. Then there is the gardener—he has been here many years. One of the younger servants may have a lover. It is easy to take an impression of a key and have one cut. There are many possibilities. Then there is another person who, I should judge, is exceedingly likely to have such a thing in her keeping.” “Who is that?” “Madame Daubreuil,” said the detective dryly. “Eh, eh!” said the magistrate, his face falling a little, “so you have heard about that, have you?” “I hear everything,” said Giraud imperturbably. “There is one thing I could swear you have not heard,” said M. Hautet, delighted to be able to show superior knowledge, and without more ado, he retailed the story of the mysterious visitor the night before."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,7,"He also touched on the cheque made out to “Duveen,” and finally handed Giraud the letter signed “Bella.” Giraud listened in silence, studied the letter attentively, and then handed it back. “All very interesting, M. le juge. But my theory remains unaffected.” “And your theory is?” “For the moment I prefer not to say. Remember, I am only just beginning my investigations.” “Tell me one thing, M. Giraud,” said Poirot suddenly. “Your theory allows for the door being opened. It does not explain why it was _left___ open. When they departed, would it not have been natural for them to close it behind them. If a _sergent de ville___ had chanced to come up to the house, as is sometimes done to see that all is well, they might have been discovered and overtaken almost at once.” “Bah! They forgot it. A mistake, I grant you.” Then, to my surprise, Poirot uttered almost the same words as he had uttered to Bex the previous evening: “_I do not agree with you.___ The door being left open was the result of either design or necessity, and any theory that does not admit that fact is bound to prove vain.” We all regarded the little man with"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,8,"a good deal of astonishment. The confession of ignorance drawn from him over the match end had, I thought, been bound to humiliate him, but here he was self satisfied as ever, laying down the law to the great Giraud without a tremor. The detective twisted his moustache, eyeing my friend in a somewhat bantering fashion. “You don’t agree with me, eh? Well, what strikes you particularly about the case. Let’s hear your views.” “One thing presents itself to me as being significant. Tell me, M. Giraud, does nothing strike you as familiar about this case? Is there nothing it reminds you of?” “Familiar? Reminds me of? I can’t say off-hand. I don’t think so, though.” “You are wrong,” said Poirot quietly. “A crime almost precisely similar has been committed before.” “When? And where?” “Ah, that, unfortunately, I cannot for the moment remember—but I shall do so. I had hoped you might be able to assist me.” Giraud snorted incredulously. “There have been many affairs of masked men! I cannot remember the details of them all. These crimes all resemble each other more or less.” “There is such a thing as the individual touch.” Poirot suddenly assumed his lecturing manner, and addressed us collectively. “I"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,9,"am speaking to you now of the psychology of crime. M. Giraud knows quite well that each criminal has his particular method, and that the police, when called in to investigate—say a case of burglary—can often make a shrewd guess at the offender, simply by the peculiar method he has employed. (Japp would tell you the same, Hastings.) Man is an unoriginal animal. Unoriginal within the law in his daily respectable life, equally unoriginal outside the law. If a man commits a crime, any other crime he commits will resemble it closely. The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality.” “And the point of all this?” sneered Giraud. “That when you have two crimes precisely similar in design and execution, you find the same brain behind them both. I am looking for that brain, M. Giraud—and I shall find it. Here we have a true clue—a psychological clue. You may"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,9,9 M. Giraud Finds Some Clues,10,"know all about cigarettes and match ends, M. Giraud, but I, Hercule Poirot, know the mind of man!” And the ridiculous little fellow tapped his forehead with emphasis. Giraud remained singularly unimpressed. “For your guidance,” continued Poirot, “I will also advise you of one fact which might fail to be brought to your notice. The wrist watch of Madame Renauld, on the day following the tragedy, had gained two hours. It might interest you to examine it.” Giraud stared. “Perhaps it was in the habit of gaining?” “As a matter of fact, I am told it did.” “_Eh bien___, then!” “All the same, two hours is a good deal,” said Poirot softly. “Then there is the matter of the footprints in the flower-bed.” He nodded his head towards the open window. Giraud took two eager strides, and looked out. “This bed here?” “Yes.” “But I see no footprints?” “No,” said Poirot, straightening a little pile of books on a table. “There are none.” For a moment an almost murderous rage obscured Giraud’s face. He took two strides towards his tormentor, but at that moment the _salon___ door was opened, and Marchaud announced. “M. Stonor, the secretary, has just arrived from England. May he enter?”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,1,"The man who entered the room was a striking figure. Very tall, with a well knit athletic frame, and a deeply bronzed face and neck, he dominated the assembly. Even Giraud seemed anaemic beside him. When I knew him better I realized that Gabriel Stonor was quite an unusual personality. English by birth, he had knocked about all over the world. He had shot big game in Africa, travelled in Korea, ranched in California, and traded in the South Sea Islands. He had been secretary to a New York railway magnate, and had spent a year encamped in the desert with a friendly tribe of Arabs. His unerring eye picked out M. Hautet. “The examining magistrate in charge of the case? Pleased to meet you, M. le juge. This is a terrible business. How’s Mrs. Renauld? Is she bearing up fairly well? It must have been an awful shock to her.” “Terrible, terrible,” said M. Hautet. “Permit me to introduce M. Bex—our commissary of police, M. Giraud of the Sûreté. This gentleman is M. Hercule Poirot. M. Renauld sent for him, but he arrived too"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,2,"late to do anything to avert the tragedy. A friend of M. Poirot’s, Captain Hastings.” Stonor looked at Poirot with some interest. “Sent for you, did he?” “You did not know, then, that M. Renauld contemplated calling in a detective?” interposed M. Bex. “No, I didn’t. But it doesn’t surprise me a bit.” “Why?” “Because the old man was rattled! I don’t know what it was all about. He didn’t confide in me. We weren’t on those terms. But rattled he was—and badly!” “H’m!” said M. Hautet. “But you have no notion of the cause?” “That’s what I said, sir.” “You will pardon me, M. Stonor, but we must begin with a few formalities. Your name?” “Gabriel Stonor.” “How long ago was it that you became secretary to M. Renauld?” “About two years ago, when he first arrived from South America. I met him through a mutual friend, and he offered me the post. A thundering good boss he was too.” “Did he talk to you much about his life in South America?” “Yes, a good bit.” “Do you know if he was ever in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,3,"Santiago?” “Several times, I believe.” “He never mentioned any special incident that occurred there—anything that might have provoked some vendetta against him?” “Never.” “Did he speak of any secret that he had acquired whilst sojourning there?” “No.” “Did he ever say anything at all about a secret?” “Not that I can remember. But, for all that, there _was___ a mystery about him. I’ve never heard him speak of his boyhood for instance, or of any incident prior to his arrival in South America. He was a French Canadian by birth, I believe, but I’ve never heard him speak of his life in Canada. He could shut up like a clam if he liked.” “So, as far as you know, he had no enemies, and you can give us no clue as to any secret to obtain possession of which he might have been murdered?” “That’s so.” “M. Stonor, have you ever heard the name of Duveen in connection with M. Renauld?” “Duveen. Duveen.” He tried the name over thoughtfully. “I don’t think I have. And yet it seems familiar.” “Do you know a lady, a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,4,"friend of M. Renauld’s whose Christian name is Bella?” Again Mr. Stonor shook his head. “Bella Duveen? Is that the full name? It’s curious! I’m sure I know it. But for the moment I can’t remember in what connection.” The magistrate coughed. “You understand, M. Stonor—the case is like this. _There must be no reservations.___ You might, perhaps, through a feeling of consideration for Madame Renauld—for whom, I gather, you have a great esteem and affection, you might—_enfin!___” said M. Hautet getting rather tied up in his sentence, “there must absolutely be no reservations.” Stonor stared at him, a dawning light of comprehension in his eyes. “I don’t quite get you,” he said gently. “Where does Mrs. Renauld come in? I’ve an immense respect and affection for that lady; she’s a very wonderful and unusual type, but I don’t quite see how my reservations, or otherwise, could affect her?” “Not if this Bella Duveen should prove to have been something more than a friend to her husband?” “Ah!” said Stonor. “I get you now. But I’ll bet my bottom dollar that you’re wrong. The old"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,5,"man never so much as looked at a petticoat. He just adored his own wife. They were the most devoted couple I know.” M. Hautet shook his head gently. “M. Stonor, we hold absolute proof—a love letter written by this Bella to M. Renauld, accusing him of having tired of her. Moreover, we have further proof that, at the time of his death, he was carrying on an intrigue with a Frenchwoman, a Madame Daubreuil, who rents the adjoining Villa. And this is the man who, according to you, never looked at a petticoat!” The secretary’s eyes narrowed. “Hold on, M. le juge. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I knew Paul Renauld. What you’ve just been saying is utterly impossible. There’s some other explanation.” The magistrate shrugged his shoulders. “What other explanation could there be?” “What leads you to think it was a love affair?” “Madame Daubreuil was in the habit of visiting him here in the evenings. Also, since M. Renauld came to the Villa Geneviève, Madame Daubreuil has paid large sums of money into the bank in notes. In all, the amount"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,6,"totals four thousand pounds of your English money.” “I guess that’s right,” said Stonor quietly. “I transmitted him those sums at his request. But it wasn’t an intrigue.” “Eh! _mon Dieu!___ What else could it be?” “_Blackmail___,” said Stonor sharply, bringing down his hand with a slam on the table. “That’s what it was.” “Ah! Voilà une idée!” cried the magistrate, shaken in spite of himself. “Blackmail,” repeated Stonor. “The old man was being bled—and at a good rate too. Four thousand in a couple of months. Whew! I told you just now there was a mystery about Renauld. Evidently this Madame Daubreuil knew enough of it to put the screws on.” “It is possible,” the commissary cried excitedly. “Decidedly, it is possible.” “Possible?” roared Stonor. “It’s certain! Tell me, have you asked Mrs. Renauld about this love affair stunt of yours?” “No, monsieur. We did not wish to occasion her any distress if it could reasonably be avoided.” “Distress? Why, she’d laugh in your face. I tell you, she and Renauld were a couple in a hundred.” “Ah, that reminds me of another point,”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,7,"said M. Hautet. “Did M. Renauld take you into his confidence at all as to the dispositions of his will?” “I know all about it—took it to the lawyer for him after he’d drawn it out. I can give you the name of his solicitors if you want to see it. They’ve got it there. Quite simple. Half in trust to his wife for her lifetime, the other half to his son. A few legacies. I rather think he left me a thousand.” “When was this will drawn up?” “Oh, about a year and a half ago.” “Would it surprise you very much, M. Stonor, to hear that M. Renauld had made another will, less than a fortnight ago?” Stonor was obviously very much surprised. “I’d no idea of it. What’s it like?” “The whole of his vast fortune is left unreservedly to his wife. There is no mention of his son.” Mr. Stonor gave vent to a prolonged whistle. “I call that rather rough on the lad. His mother adores him, of course, but to the world at large it looks rather like a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,8,"want of confidence on his father’s part. It will be rather galling to his pride. Still, it all goes to prove what I told you, that Renauld and his wife were on first rate terms.” “Quite so, quite so,” said M. Hautet. “It is possible we shall have to revise our ideas on several points. We have, of course, cabled to Santiago, and are expecting a reply from there any minute. In all possibility, everything will then be perfectly clear and straightforward. On the other hand, if your suggestion of blackmail is true, Madame Daubreuil ought to be able to give us valuable information.” Poirot interjected a remark: “M. Stonor, the English chauffeur, Masters, had he been long with M. Renauld?” “Over a year?” “Have you any idea whether he has ever been in South America?” “I’m quite sure he hasn’t. Before coming to Mr. Renauld, he had been for many years with some people in Gloucestershire whom I know well.” “In fact, you can answer for him as being above suspicion?” “Absolutely.” Poirot seemed somewhat crest-fallen. Meanwhile the magistrate had summoned Marchaud. “My"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,9,"compliments to Madame Renauld, and I should be glad to speak to her for a few minutes. Beg her not to disturb herself. I will wait upon her upstairs.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared. We waited some minutes, and then, to our surprise, the door opened, and Mrs. Renauld, deathly pale in her heavy mourning, entered the room. M. Hautet brought forward a chair, uttering vigorous protestations, and she thanked him with a smile. Stonor was holding one hand of hers in his with an eloquent sympathy. Words evidently failed him. Mrs. Renauld turned to M. Hautet. “You wished to ask me something, M. le juge.” “With your permission, madame. I understand your husband was a French Canadian by birth. Can you tell me anything of his youth, or upbringing?” She shook her head. “My husband was always very reticent about himself, monsieur. He came from the North West, I know, but I fancy that he had an unhappy childhood, for he never cared to speak of that time. Our life was lived entirely in the present and the future.” “Was there any mystery in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,10,10 Gabriel Stonor,10,"his past life?” Mrs. Renauld smiled a little, and shook her head. “Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.” M. Hautet also smiled. “True, we must not permit ourselves to get melodramatic. There is one thing more—” he hesitated. Stonor broke in impetuously: “They’ve got an extraordinary idea into their heads Mrs. Renauld. They actually fancy that Mr. Renauld was carrying on an intrigue with a Madame Daubreuil who, it seems, lives next door.” The scarlet colour flamed into Mrs. Renauld’s cheeks. She flung her head up, then bit her lip, her face quivering. Stonor stood looking at her in astonishment, but M. Bex leaned forward and said gently: “We regret to cause you pain, madame, but have you any reason to believe that Madame Daubreuil was your husband’s mistress?” With a sob of anguish, Mrs. Renauld buried her face in her hands. Her shoulders heaved convulsively. At last she lifted her head, and said brokenly: “She may have been.” Never, in all my life, have I seen anything to equal the blank amazement on Stonor’s face. He was thoroughly taken aback."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,1,"What the next development of the conversation would have been, I cannot say, for at that moment the door was thrown violently open, and a tall young man strode into the room. Just for a moment I had the uncanny sensation that the dead man had come to life again. Then I realized that this dark head was untouched with grey, and that, in point of fact, it was a mere boy who now burst in among us with so little ceremony. He went straight to Mrs. Renauld with an impetuosity that took no heed of the presence of others. “Mother!” “Jack!” With a cry she folded him in her arms. “My dearest! But what brings you here? You were to sail on the _Anzora___ from Cherbourg two days ago?” Then, suddenly recalling to herself the presence of others, she turned with a certain dignity, “My son, messieurs.” “Aha!” said M. Hautet, acknowledging the young man’s bow. “So you did not sail on the _Anzora?___” “No, monsieur. As I was about to explain, the _Anzora___ was detained twenty-four hours through engine trouble. I should have sailed last night instead of the night before, but, happening to buy an evening paper, I saw in it an account of the—the awful tragedy that had befallen us—” His voice broke and the tears came into his eyes. “My poor father—my poor, poor, father.” Staring at him like one in a dream, Mrs. Renauld repeated: “So you did not sail?” And then, with a gesture of infinite weariness, she murmured as though to herself, “After all, it does not matter—now.” “Sit down, M. Renauld, I beg of you,” said M. Hautet, indicating a chair. “My sympathy for you is profound. It must have been a terrible shock to you to learn the news as you did. However, it is most fortunate that you were prevented from sailing. I am in hopes that you may be able to give"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,2,"us just the information we need to clear up this mystery.” “I am at your disposal, M. le juge. Ask me any questions you please.” “To begin with, I understand that this journey was being undertaken at your father’s request?” “Quite so, M. le juge. I received a telegram bidding me to proceed without delay to Buenos Ayres, and from thence via the Andes to Valparaiso and on to Santiago.” “Ah. And the object of this journey?” “I have no idea, M. le juge.” “What?” “No. See, here is the telegram.” The magistrate took it and read it aloud. “‘Proceed immediately Cherbourg embark _Anzora___ sailing tonight Buenos Ayres. Ultimate destination Santiago. Further instructions will await you Buenos Ayres. Do not fail. Matter is of utmost importance. Renauld.’ And there had been no previous correspondence on the matter?” Jack Renauld shook his head. “That is the only intimation of any kind. I knew, of course, that my father, having lived so long out there, had necessarily many interests in South America. But he had never mooted any suggestion of sending me out.” “You have, of course, been a good deal in South America, M. Renauld?” “I was there as a child. But I was educated in England, and spent most of my holidays in that country, so I really know far less of South America than might be supposed. You see, the war broke out when I was seventeen.” “You served in the English Flying Corps, did you not?” “Yes, M. le juge.” M. Hautet nodded his head, and proceeded with his inquiries along the, by now, well-known lines. In response, Jack Renauld declared definitely that he knew nothing of any enmity his father might have incurred in the city of Santiago, or elsewhere in the South American continent, that he had noticed no change in his father’s manner of late, and that he had never heard him refer to a secret. He had regarded"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,3,"the mission to South America as connected with business interests. As M. Hautet paused for a minute, the quiet voice of Giraud broke in. “I should like to put a few questions on my own account, M. le juge.” “By all means, M. Giraud, if you wish,” said the magistrate coldly. Giraud edged his chair a little nearer to the table. “Were you on good terms with your father, M. Renauld?” “Certainly I was,” returned the lad haughtily. “You assert that positively?” “Yes.” “No little disputes, eh?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Every one may have a difference of opinion now and then.” “Quite so, quite so. But if any one were to assert that you had a violent quarrel with your father on the eve of your departure for Paris, that person, without doubt, would be lying?” I could not but admire the ingenuity of Giraud. His boast “I know everything” had been no idle one. Jack Renauld was clearly disconcerted by the question. “We—we did have an argument,” he admitted. “Ah, an argument! In the course of that argument did you use this phrase: ‘When you are dead, I can do as I please?’” “I may have done,” muttered the other. “I don’t know.” “In response to that, did your father say: ‘But I am not dead yet!’ To which you responded: ‘I wish you were!’” The boy made no answer. His hands fiddled nervously with the things on the table in front of him. “I must request an answer, please, M. Renauld,” said Giraud sharply. With an angry exclamation, the boy swept a heavy paper-knife on to the floor. “What does it matter? You might as well know. Yes, I did quarrel with my father. I dare say I said all those things—I was so angry I cannot even remember what I said! I was furious—I could almost have killed him at that moment—there, make the most of that!” He leant back"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,4,"in his chair, flushed and defiant. Giraud smiled, then, moving his chair back a little, said: “That is all. You would, without doubt, prefer to continue the interrogatory, M. le juge.” “Ah, yes, exactly,” said M. Hautet. “And what was the subject of your quarrel?” “I decline to state.” M. Hautet sat up in his chair. “M. Renauld, it is not permitted to trifle with the law!” he thundered. “What was the subject of the quarrel?” Young Renauld remained silent, his boyish face sullen and overcast. But another voice spoke, imperturbable and calm, the voice of Hercule Poirot. “I will inform you, if you like, M. le juge.” “You know?” “Certainly I know. The subject of the quarrel was Mademoiselle Marthe Daubreuil.” Renauld sprang round, startled. The magistrate leaned forward. “Is this so, monsieur.” Jack Renauld bowed his head. “Yes,” he admitted. “I love Mademoiselle Daubreuil, and I wish to marry her. When I informed my father of the fact, he flew at once into a violent rage. Naturally I could not stand hearing the girl I loved insulted, and I, too, lost my temper.” M. Hautet looked across at Mrs. Renauld. “You were aware of this—attachment, madame.” “I feared it,” she replied simply. “Mother,” cried the boy. “You too! Marthe is as good as she is beautiful. What can you have against her?” “I have nothing against Mademoiselle Daubreuil in any way. But I should prefer you to marry an Englishwoman, or if a Frenchwoman not one who has a mother of doubtful antecedents!” Her rancour against the older woman showed plainly in her voice, and I could well understand that it must have been a bitter blow to her when her only son showed signs of falling in love with the daughter of her rival. Mrs. Renauld continued, addressing the magistrate: “I ought, perhaps, to have spoken to my husband on the subject, but I hoped that it was only a boy"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,5,"and girl flirtation which would blow over all the quicker if no notice was taken of it. I blame myself now for my silence, but my husband, as I told you, had seemed so anxious and care-worn, different altogether from his normal self, that I was chiefly concerned not to give him any additional worry.” M. Hautet nodded. “When you informed your father of your intentions towards Mademoiselle Daubreuil,” he resumed, “he was surprised?” “He seemed completely taken aback. Then he ordered me peremptorily to dismiss any such idea from my mind. He would never give his consent to such a marriage. Nettled, I demanded what he had against Mademoiselle Daubreuil. To that he could give no satisfactory reply, but spoke in slighting terms of the mystery surrounding the lives of the mother and daughter. I answered that I was marrying Marthe, and not her antecedents, but he shouted me down with a peremptory refusal to discuss the matter in any way. The whole thing must be given up. The injustice and high-handedness of it all maddened me—especially since he himself always seemed to go out of his way to be attentive to the Daubreuils and was always suggesting that they should be asked to the house. I lost my head, and we quarrelled in earnest. My father reminded me that I was entirely dependent on him, and it must have been in answer to that that I made the remark about doing as I pleased after his death—” Poirot interrupted with a quick question. “You were aware, then, of the terms of your father’s will?” “I knew that he had left half his fortune to me, the other half in trust for my mother to come to me at her death,” replied the lad. “Proceed with your story,” said the magistrate. “After that we shouted at each other in sheer rage, until I suddenly realized that I was in danger of missing my"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,6,"train to Paris. I had to run for the station, still in a white heat of fury. However, once well away, I calmed down. I wrote to Marthe, telling her what had happened, and her reply soothed me still further. She pointed out to me that we had only to be steadfast, and any opposition was bound to give way at last. Our affection for each other must be tried and proved, and when my parents realized that it was no light infatuation on my part they would doubtless relent towards us. Of course, to her, I had not dwelt on my father’s principal objection to the match. I soon saw that I should do my cause no good by violence. My father wrote me several letters to Paris, affectionate in tone, and which did not refer to our disagreement or its cause, and I replied in the same strain.” “You can produce those letters, eh?” said Giraud. “I did not keep them.” “No matter,” said the detective. Renauld looked at him for a moment, but the magistrate was continuing his questions. “To pass to another matter, are you acquainted with the name of Duveen, M. Renauld?” “Duveen?” said Jack. “Duveen?” He leant forward, and slowly picked up the paper-knife he had swept from the table. As he lifted his head, his eyes met the watching ones of Giraud. “Duveen? No, I can’t say I am.” “Will you read this letter, M. Renauld? And tell me if you have any idea as to who the person was who addressed it to your father?” Jack Renauld took the letter, and read it through, the colour mounting in his face as he did so. “Addressed to my father?” The emotion and indignation in his tones were evident. “Yes. We found it in the pocket of his coat.” “Does—” He hesitated, throwing the merest fraction of a glance towards his mother. The magistrate understood. “As yet—no."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,7,"Can you give us any clue as to the writer?” “I have no idea whatsoever.” M. Hautet sighed. “A most mysterious case. Ah, well, I suppose we can now rule out the letter altogether. What do you think, M. Giraud? It does not seem to lead us anywhere.” “It certainly does not,” agreed the detective with emphasis. “And yet,” sighed the magistrate, “it promised at the beginning to be such a beautiful and simple case!” He caught Mrs. Renauld’s eye, and blushed in immediate confusion. “Ah, yes,” he coughed, turning over the papers on the table. “Let me see, where were we? Oh, the weapon. I fear this may give you pain, M. Renauld. I understand it was a present from you to your mother. Very sad—very distressing—” Jack Renauld leaned forward. His face, which had flushed during the perusal of the letter, was now deadly white. “Do you mean—that it was with an aeroplane wire paper cutter that my father was—was killed? But it’s impossible! A little thing like that!” “Alas, M. Renauld, it is only too true! An ideal little tool, I fear. Sharp and easy to handle.” “Where is it? Can I see it? Is it still in the—the body?” “Oh, no, it had been removed. You would like to see it? To make sure? It would be as well, perhaps, though madame has already identified it. Still—M. Bex, might I trouble you?” “Certainly, M. le juge. I will fetch it immediately.” “Would it not be better to take M. Renauld to the shed?” suggested Giraud smoothly. “Without doubt he would wish to see his father’s body.” The boy made a shivering gesture of negation, and the magistrate, always disposed to cross Giraud whenever possible, replied. “But no—not at present. M. Bex will be so kind as to bring it to us here.” The commissary left the room. Stonor crossed to Jack, and wrung him by the hand. Poirot had"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,8,"risen and was adjusting a pair of candlesticks that struck his trained eye as being a shade askew. The magistrate was reading the mysterious love-letter through a last time, clinging desperately to his first theory of jealousy and a stab in the back. Suddenly the door burst open and the commissary rushed in. “M. le juge! M. le juge!” “But yes. What is it?” “The dagger! It is gone!” “_Comment___—gone?” “Vanished. Disappeared. The glass jar that contained it is empty!” “What?” I cried. “Impossible. Why, only this morning I saw—” The words died on my tongue. But the attention of the entire room was diverted to me. “What is that you say?” cried the commissary. “This morning?” “I saw it there this morning,” I said slowly. “About an hour and a half ago, to be accurate.” “You went to the shed, then? How did you get the key?” “I asked the _sergent de ville___ for it.” “And you went there? Why?” I hesitated, but in the end I decided that the only thing to do was to make a clean breast of it. “M. le juge,” I said. “I have committed a grave fault, for which I must crave your indulgence.” “_Eh bien!___ Proceed, monsieur.” “The fact of the matter is,” I said, wishing myself anywhere else than where I was, “that I met a young lady, an acquaintance of mine. She displayed a great desire to see everything that was to be seen, and I—well, in short, I took the key to show her the body.” “Ah, _par exemple___,” cried the magistrate indignantly. “But it is a grave fault you have committed there, Captain Hastings. It is altogether most irregular. You should not have permitted yourself this folly.” “I know,” I said meekly. “Nothing that you can say could be too severe, M. le juge.” “You did not invite this lady to come here?” “Certainly not. I met her quite by accident."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,9,"She is an English lady who happens to be staying in Merlinville, though I was not aware of that until my unexpected meeting with her.” “Well, well,” said the magistrate, softening. “It was most irregular, but the lady is without doubt young and beautiful, _n’est-ce pas?___ What it is to be young! _O jeunesse, jeunesse!___” And he sighed sentimentally. But the commissary, less romantic, and more practical, took up the tale: “But did not you reclose and lock the door when you departed.” “That’s just it,” I said slowly. “That’s what I blame myself for so terribly. My friend was upset at the sight. She nearly fainted. I got her some brandy and water, and afterwards insisted on accompanying her back to town. In the excitement, I forgot to relock the door. I only did so when I got back to the Villa.” “Then for twenty minutes at least—” said the commissary slowly. He stopped. “Exactly,” I said. “Twenty minutes,” mused the commissary. “It is deplorable,” said M. Hautet, his sternness of manner returning. “Without precedent.” Suddenly another voice spoke. “You find it deplorable, M. le juge?” asked Giraud. “Certainly I do.” “_Eh bien!___ I find it admirable,” said the other imperturbably. This unexpected ally quite bewildered me. “Admirable, M. Giraud?” asked the magistrate, studying him cautiously out of the corner of his eye. “Precisely.” “And why?” “Because we know now that the assassin, or an accomplice of the assassin, has been near the Villa only an hour ago. It will be strange if, with that knowledge, we do not shortly lay hands upon him.” There was a note of menace in his voice. He continued: “He risked a good deal to gain possession of that dagger. Perhaps he feared that finger-prints might be discovered on it.” Poirot turned to Bex. “You said there were none?” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Perhaps he could not be sure.” Poirot looked at him. “You are wrong,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,11,11 Jack Renauld,10,"M. Giraud. The assassin wore gloves. So he must have been sure.” “I do not say it was the assassin himself. It may have been an accomplice who was not aware of that fact.” “_Ils sont mal renseignés, les accomplices!___” muttered Poirot, but he said no more. The magistrate’s clerk was gathering up the papers on the table. M. Hautet addressed us: “Our work here is finished. Perhaps, M. Renauld, you will listen whilst your evidence is read over to you. I have purposely kept all the proceedings as informal as possible. I have been called original in my methods, but I maintain that there is much to be said for originality. The case is now in the clever hands of the renowned M. Giraud. He will without doubt distinguish himself. Indeed, I wonder that he has not already laid his hands upon the murderers! Madame, again let me assure you of my heart-felt sympathy. Messieurs, I wish you all good day.” And, accompanied by his clerk and the commissary, he took his departure. Poirot tugged out that large turnip of a watch of his, and observed the time. “Let us return to the hotel for lunch, my friend,” he said. “And you shall recount to me in full the indiscretions of this morning. No one is observing us. We need make no adieux.” We went quietly out of the room. The examining magistrate had just driven off in his car. I was going down the steps when Poirot’s voice arrested me: “One little moment, my friend.” Dexterously, he whipped out his yard measure, and proceeded, quite solemnly, to measure an overcoat hanging in the hall from the collar to the hem. I had not seen it hanging there before, and guessed that it belonged to either Mr. Stonor, or Jack Renauld. Then, with a little satisfied grunt, Poirot returned the measure to his pocket, and followed me out into the open air."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,1,"“Why did you measure that overcoat?” I asked, with some curiosity, as we walked down the hot white road at a leisurely pace. “_Parbleu!___ to see how long it was,” replied my friend imperturbably. I was vexed. Poirot’s incurable habit of making a mystery out of nothing never failed to irritate me. I relapsed into silence, and followed a train of thought of my own. Although I had not noticed them specially at the time, certain words Mrs. Renauld had addressed to her son now recurred to me, fraught with a new significance. “So you did not sail?” she had said, and then had added: “_After all, it does not matter—now.___” What had she meant by that? The words were enigmatical—significant. Was it possible that she knew more than we supposed? She had denied all knowledge of the mysterious mission with which her husband was to have entrusted his son. But was she really less ignorant than she pretended? Could she enlighten us if she chose, and was her silence part of a carefully thought out and preconceived plan? The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I was right. Mrs. Renauld knew more than she chose to tell. In her surprise at seeing her son, she had momentarily betrayed herself. I felt convinced that she knew, if not the assassins, at least the motive for the assassination. But some very powerful considerations must keep her silent. “You think profoundly, my friend,” remarked Poirot, breaking in upon my reflections."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,2,"“What is it that intrigues you so?” I told him, sure of my ground, though feeling expectant that he would ridicule my suspicions. But to my surprise he nodded thoughtfully. “You are quite right, Hastings. From the beginning I have been sure that she was keeping something back. At first I suspected her, if not of inspiring, at least of conniving at the crime.” “You suspected _her?___” I cried. “But certainly! She benefits enormously—in fact, by this new will, she is the only person to benefit. So, from the start, she was singled out for attention. You may have noticed that I took an early opportunity of examining her wrists. I wished to see whether there was any possibility that she had gagged and bound herself. _Eh bien___, I saw at once that there was no fake, the cords had actually been drawn so tight as to cut into the flesh. That ruled out the possibility of her having committed the crime single-handed. But it was still possible for her to have connived at it, or to have been the instigator with an accomplice. Moreover, the story, as she told it, was singularly familiar to me—the masked men that she could not recognize, the mention of ‘the secret’—I had heard, or read, all these things before. Another little detail confirmed my belief that she was not speaking the truth. _The wrist watch, Hastings, the wrist watch!___” Again that wrist watch! Poirot was eyeing me curiously. “You see, _mon ami?___ You comprehend?” “No,” I"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,3,"replied with some ill humour. “I neither see nor comprehend. You make all these confounded mysteries, and it’s useless asking you to explain. You always like keeping everything up your sleeve to the last minute.” “Do not enrage yourself, my friend,” said Poirot with a smile. “I will explain if you wish. But not a word to Giraud, _c’est entendu?___ He treats me as an old one of no importance! _We shall see!___ In common fairness I gave him a hint. If he does not choose to act upon it, that is his own look out.” I assured Poirot that he could rely upon my discretion. “_C’est bien!___ Let us then employ our little grey cells. Tell me, my friend, at what time, according to you, did the tragedy take place?” “Why, at two o’clock or thereabouts,” I said, astonished. “You remember, Mrs. Renauld told us that she heard the clock strike while the men were in the room.” “Exactly, and on the strength of that, you, the examining magistrate, Bex, and every one else, accept the time without further question. But I, Hercule Poirot, say that Madame Renauld lied. _The crime took place at least two hours earlier.___” “But the doctors—” “They declared, after examination of the body, that death had taken place between ten and seven hours previously. _Mon ami___, for some reason, it was imperative that the crime should seem to have taken place later than it actually did. You have read of a smashed watch or clock recording the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,4,"exact hour of a crime? So that the time should not rest on Mrs. Renauld’s testimony alone, some one moved on the hands of that wrist watch to two o’clock, and then dashed it violently to the ground. But, as is often the case, they defeated their own object. The glass was smashed, but the mechanism of the watch was uninjured. It was a most disastrous manoeuvre on their part, for it at once drew my attention to two points—first, that Madame Renauld was lying: secondly, that there must be some vital reason for the postponement of the time.” “But what reason could there be?” “Ah, that is the question! There we have the whole mystery. As yet, I cannot explain it. There is only one idea that presents itself to me as having a possible connection.” “And that is?” “The last train left Merlinville at seventeen minutes past twelve.” I followed it out slowly. “So that, the crime apparently taking place some two hours later, any one leaving by that train would have an unimpeachable alibi!” “Perfect, Hastings! You have it!” I sprang up. “But we must inquire at the station. Surely they cannot have failed to notice two foreigners who left by that train! We must go there at once!” “You think so, Hastings?” “Of course. Let us go there now.” Poirot restrained my ardour with a light touch upon the arm. “Go by all means if you wish, _mon ami___—but if you go, I should not ask for particulars of"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,5,"two foreigners.” I stared, and he said rather impatiently: “Là, là, you do not believe all that rigmarole, do you? The masked men and all the rest of _cette histoire-là!___” His words took me so much aback that I hardly knew how to respond. He went on serenely: “You heard me say to Giraud, did you not, that all the details of this crime were familiar to me? _Eh bien___, that presupposes one of two things, either the brain that planned the first crime also planned this one, or else an account read of a _cause célèbre___ unconsciously remained in our assassin’s memory and prompted the details. I shall be able to pronounce definitely on that after—” he broke off. I was revolving sundry matters in my mind. “But Mr. Renauld’s letter? It distinctly mentions a secret and Santiago?” “Undoubtedly there was a secret in M. Renauld’s life—there can be no doubt of that. On the other hand, the word Santiago, to my mind, is a red herring, dragged continually across the track to put us off the scent. It is possible that it was used in the same way on M. Renauld, to keep him from directing his suspicions into a quarter nearer at hand. Oh, be assured, Hastings, the danger that threatened him was not in Santiago, it was near at hand, in France.” He spoke so gravely, and with such assurance, that I could not fail to be convinced. But I essayed one final objection: “And the match and"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,6,"cigarette end found near the body? What of them.” A light of pure enjoyment lit up Poirot’s face. “Planted! Deliberately planted there for Giraud or one of his tribe to find! Ah, he is smart, Giraud, he can do his tricks! So can a good retriever dog. He comes in so pleased with himself. For hours he has crawled on his stomach. ‘See what I have found,’ he says. And then again to me: ‘What do you see here?’ Me, I answer, with profound and deep truth, ‘Nothing.’ And Giraud, the great Giraud, he laughs, he thinks to himself, ‘Oh, that he is imbecile, this old one!’ _But we shall see.…___” But my mind had reverted to the main facts. “Then all this story of the masked men—?” “Is false.” “What really happened?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “One person could tell us—Madame Renauld. But she will not speak. Threats and entreaties would not move her. A remarkable woman that, Hastings. I recognized as soon as I saw her that I had to deal with a woman of unusual character. At first, as I told you, I was inclined to suspect her of being concerned in the crime. Afterwards I altered my opinion.” “What made you do that?” “Her spontaneous and genuine grief at the sight of her husband’s body. I could swear that the agony in that cry of hers was genuine.” “Yes,” I said thoughtfully, “one cannot mistake these things.” “I beg your pardon, my friend—one can always be mistaken. Regard"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,7,"a great actress, does not her acting of grief carry you away and impress you with its reality? No, however strong my own impression and belief, I needed other evidence before I allowed myself to be satisfied. The great criminal can be a great actor. I base my certainty in this case, not upon my own impression, but upon the undeniable fact that Mrs. Renauld actually fainted. I turned up her eyelids and felt her pulse. There was no deception—the swoon was genuine. Therefore I was satisfied that her anguish was real and not assumed. Besides, a small additional point not without interest, it was unnecessary for Mrs. Renauld to exhibit unrestrained grief. She had had one paroxysm on learning of her husband’s death, and there would be no need for her to simulate another such a violent one on beholding his body. No, Mrs. Renauld was not her husband’s murderess. But why has she lied? She lied about the wrist watch, she lied about the masked men—she lied about a third thing. Tell me, Hastings, what is your explanation of the open door?” “Well,” I said, rather embarrassed, “I suppose it was an oversight. They forgot to shut it.” Poirot shook his head, and sighed. “That is the explanation of Giraud. It does not satisfy me. There is a meaning behind that open door which for a moment I cannot fathom.” “I have an idea,” I cried suddenly. “_A la bonne heure!___ Let us hear it.” “Listen. We are agreed that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,8,"Mrs. Renauld’s story is a fabrication. Is it not possible, then, that Mr. Renauld left the house to keep an appointment—possibly with the murderer—leaving the front door open for his return. But he did not return, and the next morning he is found, stabbed in the back.” “An admirable theory, Hastings, but for two facts which you have characteristically overlooked. In the first place, who gagged and bound Madame Renauld? And why on earth should they return to the house to do so? In the second place, no man on earth would go out to keep an appointment wearing his underclothes and an overcoat. There are circumstances in which a man might wear pajamas and an overcoat—but the other, never!” “True,” I said, rather crest-fallen. “No,” continued Poirot, “we must look elsewhere for a solution of the open door mystery. One thing I am fairly sure of—they did not leave through the door. They left by the window.” “What?” “Precisely.” “But there were no footmarks in the flower bed underneath.” “No—_and there ought to have been.___ Listen, Hastings. The gardener, Auguste, as you heard him say, planted both those beds the preceding afternoon. In the one there are plentiful impressions of his big hobnailed boots—in the other, _none!___ You see? Some one had passed that way, some one who, to obliterate their footprints, smoothed over the surface of the bed with a rake.” “Where did they get a rake?” “Where they got the spade and the gardening gloves,” said Poirot impatiently. “There"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,9,"is no difficulty about that.” “What makes you think that they left that way, though? Surely it is more probable that they entered by the window, and left by the door.” “That is possible of course. Yet I have a strong idea that they left by the window.” “I think you are wrong.” “Perhaps, _mon ami___.” I mused, thinking over the new field of conjecture that Poirot’s deductions had opened up to me. I recalled my wonder at his cryptic allusions to the flower bed and the wrist watch. His remarks had seemed so meaningless at the moment and now, for the first time, I realized how remarkably, from a few slight incidents, he had unravelled much of the mystery that surrounded the case. I paid a belated homage to my friend. As though he read my thoughts, he nodded sagely. “Method, you comprehend! Method! Arrange your facts. Arrange your ideas. And if some little fact will not fit in—do not reject it but consider it closely. Though its significance escapes you, be sure that it is significant.” “In the meantime,” I said, considering, “although we know a great deal more than we did, we are no nearer to solving the mystery of who killed Mr. Renauld.” “No,” said Poirot cheerfully. “In fact we are a great deal further off.” The fact seemed to afford him such peculiar satisfaction that I gazed at him in wonder. He met my eye and smiled. “But yes, it is better so. Before, there was at"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,12,12 Poirot Elucidates Certain Points,10,"all events a clear theory as to how and by whose hands he met his death. Now that is all gone. We are in darkness. A hundred conflicting points confuse and worry us. That is well. That is excellent. Out of confusion comes forth order. But if you find order to start with, if a crime seems simple and above-board, _eh bien, méfiez vous!___ It is, how do you say it?—_cooked!___ The great criminal is simple—but very few criminals _are___ great. In trying to cover up their tracks, they invariably betray themselves. Ah, _mon ami___, I would that some day I could meet a really great criminal—one who commits his crime, and then—does nothing! Even I, Hercule Poirot, might fail to catch such a one.” But I had not followed his words. A light had burst upon me. “Poirot! Mrs. Renauld! I see it now. She must be shielding somebody.” From the quietness with which Poirot received my remark, I could see that the idea had already occurred to him. “Yes,” he said thoughtfully. “Shielding some one—or screening some one. One of the two.” I saw very little difference between the two words, but I developed my theme with a good deal of earnestness. Poirot maintained a strictly non-committal attitude, repeating: “It may be—yes, it may be. But as yet I do not know! There is something very deep underneath all this. You will see. Something very deep.” Then, as we entered our hotel, he enjoined silence on me with a gesture."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,1,"We lunched with an excellent appetite. I understood well enough that Poirot did not wish to discuss the tragedy where we could so easily be overheard. But, as is usual when one topic fills the mind to the exclusion of everything else, no other subject of interest seemed to present itself. For a while we ate in silence, and then Poirot observed maliciously: “_Eh bien!___ And your indiscretions! You recount them not?” I felt myself blushing. “Oh, you mean this morning?” I endeavoured to adopt a tone of absolute nonchalance. But I was no match for Poirot. In a very few minutes he had extracted the whole story from me, his eyes twinkling as he did so. “_Tiens!___ A story of the most romantic. What is her name, this charming young lady?” I had to confess that I did not know. “Still more romantic! The first _rencontre___ in the train from Paris, the second here. Journeys end in lovers’ meetings, is not that the saying?” “Don’t be an ass, Poirot.” “Yesterday it was Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it is Mademoiselle—Cinderella! Decidedly you have the heart of a Turk, Hastings! You should establish a harem!” “It’s all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil is a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely—I don’t mind admitting it. The other’s nothing—don’t suppose I shall ever see her again. She was quite amusing to talk to just for a railway journey, but she’s not the kind of girl I should ever get keen on.” “Why?” “Well—it sounds snobbish perhaps—but she’s not a lady, not in any sense of the word.” Poirot nodded thoughtfully. There was"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,2,"less raillery in his voice as he asked: “You believe, then, in birth and breeding?” “I may be old-fashioned, but I certainly don’t believe in marrying out of one’s class. It never answers.” “I agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it is as you say. But there is always the hundredth time! Still, that does not arise, as you do not propose to see the lady again.” His last words were almost a question, and I was aware of the sharpness with which he darted a glance at me. And before my eyes, writ large in letters of fire, I saw the words “Hôtel du Phare,” and I heard again her voice saying “Come and look me up” and my own answering with _empressement___: “I will.” Well, what of it? I had meant to go at the time. But since then, I had had time to reflect. I did not like the girl. Thinking it over in cold blood, I came definitely to the conclusion that I disliked her intensely. I had got hauled over the coals for foolishly gratifying her morbid curiosity, and I had not the least wish to see her again. I answered Poirot lightly enough. “She asked me to look her up, but of course I shan’t.” “Why ‘of course’?” “Well—I don’t want to.” “I see.” He studied me attentively for some minutes. “Yes. I see very well. And you are wise. Stick to what you have said.” “That seems to be your invariable advice,” I remarked, rather piqued. “Ah, my friend, have faith in Papa Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I will"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,3,"arrange you a marriage of great suitability.” “Thank you,” I said laughing, “but the prospect leaves me cold.” Poirot sighed and shook his head. “_Les Anglais!___” he murmured. “No method—absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!” He frowned, and altered the position of the salt cellar. “Mademoiselle Cinderella is staying at the Hôtel d’Angleterre you told me, did you not?” “No. Hôtel du Phare.” “True, I forgot.” A moment’s misgiving shot across my mind. Surely I had never mentioned any hotel to Poirot. I looked across at him, and felt reassured. He was cutting his bread into neat little squares, completely absorbed in his task. He must have fancied I had told him where the girl was staying. We had coffee outside facing the sea. Poirot smoked one of his tiny cigarettes, and then drew his watch from his pocket. “The train to Paris leaves at 2:25,” he observed. “I should be starting.” “Paris?” I cried. “That is what I said, _mon ami___.” “You are going to Paris? But why?” He replied very seriously. “To look for the murderer of M. Renauld.” “You think he is in Paris?” “I am quite certain that he is not. Nevertheless, it is there that I must look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to you in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris is necessary. I shall not be away long. In all probability I shall return tomorrow. I do not propose that you should accompany me. Remain here and keep an eye on Giraud. Also cultivate the society of M. Renauld _fils___. And thirdly, if you wish,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,4,"endeavour to cut him out with Mademoiselle Marthe. But I fear you will not have great success.” I did not quite relish the last remark. “That reminds me,” I said. “I meant to ask you how you knew about those two?” “_Mon ami___—I know human nature. Throw together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result is almost inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It was money or a woman and, remembering Léonie’s description of the lad’s anger, I decided on the latter. So I made my guess—and I was right.” “And that was why you warned me against setting my heart on the lady? You already suspected that she loved young Renauld?” Poirot smiled. “At any rate—_I saw that she had anxious eyes.___ That is how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _as the girl with the anxious eyes.…___” His voice was so grave that it impressed me uncomfortably. “What do you mean by that, Poirot?” “I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start.” “You’ve oceans of time.” “Perhaps—perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself.” “At all events,” I said, rising, “I will come and see you off.” “You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it.” He was so peremptory that I stared at him in surprise. He nodded emphatically. “I mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it is not the English custom. Une poignee de main, alors.” I felt rather at a loose end"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,5,"after Poirot had left me. I strolled down the beach, and watched the bathers, without feeling energetic enough to join them. I rather fancied that Cinderella might be disporting herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I saw no signs of her. I strolled aimlessly along the sands towards the further end of the town. It occurred to me that, after all, it would only be decent feeling on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save trouble in the end. The matter would then be finished with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I did not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoying in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it quite clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I left the beach, and walked inland. I soon found the Hôtel du Phare, a very unpretentious building. It was annoying in the extreme not to know the lady’s name and, to save my dignity, I decided to stroll inside and look around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville was a small place, you left your hotel to go to the beach, and you left the beach to return to the hotel. There were no other attractions. There was a Casino being built, but it was not yet completed. I had walked the length of the beach without seeing her, therefore she"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,6,"must be in the hotel. I went in. Several people were sitting in the tiny lounge, but my quarry was not amongst them. I looked into some other rooms, but there was no sign of her. I waited for some time, till my impatience got the better of me. I took the concierge aside, and slipped five francs into his hand. “I wish to see a lady who is staying here. A young English lady, small and dark. I am not sure of her name.” The man shook his head, and seemed to be suppressing a grin. “There is no such lady as you describe staying here.” “She is American possibly,” I suggested. These fellows are so stupid. But the man continued to shake his head. “No, monsieur. There are only six or seven English and American ladies altogether, and they are all much older than the lady you are seeking. It is not here that you will find her, monsieur.” He was so positive that I felt doubts. “But the lady told me she was staying here.” “Monsieur must have made a mistake—or it is more likely the lady did, since there has been another gentleman here inquiring for her.” “What is that you say?” I cried, surprised. “But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who described her just as you have done.” “What was he like?” “He was a small gentleman, well dressed, very neat, very spotless, the moustache very stiff, the head of a peculiar shape, and the eyes green.” Poirot! So that was why he refused to let me accompany him to the station. The impertinence of it! I would thank"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,7,"him not to meddle in my concerns. Did he fancy I needed a nurse to look after me? Thanking the man, I departed, somewhat at a loss, and still much incensed with my meddlesome friend. I regretted that he was, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoyed telling him what I thought of his unwarranted interference. Had I not distinctly told him that I had no intention of seeing the girl? Decidedly, one’s friends can be too zealous! But where was the lady? I set aside my wrath, and tried to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she had named the wrong hotel. Then another thought struck me. Was it inadvertence? Or had she deliberately withheld her name and given me the wrong address? The more I thought about it, the more I felt convinced that this last surmise of mine was right. For some reason or other she did not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour earlier this had been precisely my own view, I did not enjoy having the tables turned upon me. The whole affair was profoundly unsatisfactory, and I went up to the Villa Geneviève in a condition of distinct ill humour. I did not go to the house, but went up the path to the little bench by the shed, and sat there moodily enough. I was distracted from my thoughts by the sound of voices close at hand. In a second or two I realized that they came, not from the garden I was in, but from the adjoining garden of the Villa Marguerite, and that they"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,8,"were approaching rapidly. A girl’s voice was speaking, a voice that I recognized as that of the beautiful Marthe. “_Chéri___,” she was saying, “is it really true? Are all our troubles over.” “You know it, Marthe,” Jack Renauld replied. “Nothing can part us now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union is removed. Nothing can take you from me.” “Nothing?” the girl murmured. “Oh, Jack, Jack—I am afraid.” I had moved to depart, realizing that I was quite unintentionally eavesdropping. As I rose to my feet, I caught sight of them through a gap in the hedge. They stood together facing me, the man’s arm round the girl, his eyes looking into hers. They were a splendid looking couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the fair young goddess. They seemed made for each other as they stood there, happy in spite of the terrible tragedy that overshadowed their young lives. But the girl’s face was troubled, and Jack Renauld seemed to recognize it, as he held her closer to him and asked: “But what are you afraid of, darling? What is there to fear—now?” And then I saw the look in her eyes, the look Poirot had spoken of, as she murmured, so that I almost guessed at the words. “I am afraid—for _you___.…” I did not hear young Renauld’s answer, for my attention was distracted by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appeared to be a brown bush there, which seemed odd, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I stepped along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown bush withdrew itself"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,9,"precipitately, and faced me with a finger to its lips. It was Giraud. Enjoining caution, he led the way round the shed until we were out of ear-shot. “What were you doing there?” I asked. “Exactly what you were doing—listening.” “But I was not there on purpose!” “Ah!” said Giraud. “I was.” As always, I admired the man whilst disliking him. He looked me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. “You didn’t help matters by butting in. I might have heard something useful in a minute. What have you done with your old fossil?” “M. Poirot has gone to Paris,” I replied coldly. “And I can tell you, M. Giraud, that he is anything but an old fossil. He has solved many cases that have completely baffled the English police.” “Bah! The English police!” Giraud snapped his fingers disdainfully. “They must be on a level with our examining magistrates. So he has gone to Paris, has he? Well, a good thing. The longer he stays there, the better. But what does he think he will find there?” I thought I read in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I drew myself up. “That I am not at liberty to say,” I said quietly. Giraud subjected me to a piercing stare. “He has probably enough sense not to tell _you___,” he remarked rudely. “Good afternoon. I’m busy.” And with that, he turned on his heel, and left me without ceremony. Matters seemed at a standstill at the Villa Geneviève. Giraud evidently did not desire my company and, from what I had seen, it seemed fairly certain that Jack Renauld did"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,13,13 The Girl with the Anxious Eyes,10,"not either. I went back to the town, had an enjoyable bath and returned to the hotel. I turned in early, wondering whether the following day would bring forth anything of interest. I was wholly unprepared for what it did bring forth. I was eating my petit déjeuner in the dining-room, when the waiter, who had been talking to some one outside, came back in obvious excitement. He hesitated for a minute, fidgeting with his napkin, and then burst out. “Monsieur will pardon me, but he is connected, is he not, with the affair at the Villa Geneviève?’ “Yes,” I said eagerly. “Why?” “Monsieur has not heard the news, though?” “What news?” “That there has been another murder there last night!” “_What?___” Leaving my breakfast, I caught up my hat and ran as fast as I could. Another murder—and Poirot away! What fatality. But who had been murdered? I dashed in at the gate. A group of the servants was in the drive, talking and gesticulating. I caught hold of Françoise. “What has happened?” “Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It is terrible. There is a curse upon the house. But yes, I say it, a curse! They should send for M. le curé to bring some holy water. Never will I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who knows?” She crossed herself. “Yes,” I cried, “but who has been killed?” “Do I know—me? A man—a stranger. They found him up there—in the shed—not a hundred yards from where they found poor Monsieur. And that is not all. He is stabbed—stabbed to the heart _with the same dagger!___”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,1,"Waiting for no more, I turned and ran up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stood aside to let me pass and, filled with excitement, I entered. The light was dim, the place was a mere rough wooden erection to keep old pots and tools in. I had entered impetuously, but on the threshold I checked myself, fascinated by the spectacle before me. Giraud was on his hands and knees, a pocket torch in his hand with which he was examining every inch of the ground. He looked up with a frown at my entrance, then his face relaxed a little in a sort of good-humoured contempt. “Ah, _c’est l’Anglais!___ Enter then. Let us see what you can make of this affair.” Rather stung by his tone, I stooped my head, and passed in. “There he is,” said Giraud, flashing his torch to the far corner. I stepped across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He was of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly about fifty years of age. He was neatly dressed in a dark"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,2,"blue suit, well cut and probably made by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face was terribly convulsed, and on his left side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stood up, black and shining. I recognized it. It was the same dagger I had seen reposing in the glass jar the preceding morning! “I’m expecting the doctor any minute,” explained Giraud. “Although we hardly need him. There’s no doubt what the man died of. He was stabbed to the heart, and death must have been pretty well instantaneous.” “When was it done? Last night?” Giraud shook his head. “Hardly. I don’t lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man’s been dead well over twelve hours. When do you say you last saw that dagger?” “About ten o’clock yesterday morning.” “Then I should be inclined to fix the crime as being done not long after that.” “But people were passing and repassing this shed continually.” Giraud laughed disagreeably. “You progress to a marvel! Who told you he was killed in this shed?” “Well—” I felt flustered. “I—I assumed it.”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,3,"“Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, _mon petit___—does a man stabbed to the heart fall like that—neatly with his feet together, and his arms to his side? No. Again does a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stabbed without raising a hand to defend himself? It is absurd, is it not? But see here—and here—” He flashed the torch along the ground. I saw curious irregular marks in the soft dirt. “He was dragged here after he was dead. Half dragged, half carried by two people. Their tracks do not show on the hard ground outside, and here they have been careful to obliterate them—but one of the two was a woman, my young friend.” “A woman?” “Yes.” “But if the tracks are obliterated, how do you know?” “Because, blurred as they are, the prints of the woman’s shoe are unmistakable. Also, by _this___—” And, leaning forward, he drew something from the handle of the dagger and held it up for me to see. It was a woman’s long black hair—similar to the one Poirot had taken"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,4,"from the arm-chair in the library. With a slightly ironic smile he wound it round the dagger again. “We will leave things as they are as much as possible,” he explained. “It pleases the examining magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice anything else?” I was forced to shake my head. “Look at his hands.” I did. The nails were broken and discoloured, and the skin was hard. It hardly enlightened me as much as I should have liked it to have done. I looked up at Giraud. “They are not the hands of a gentleman,” he said, answering my look. “On the contrary his clothes are those of a well-to-do man. That is curious, is it not?” “Very curious,” I agreed. “And none of his clothing is marked. What do we learn from that? This man was trying to pass himself off as other than he was. He was masquerading. Why? Did he fear something? Was he trying to escape by disguising himself? As yet we do not know, but one thing we do know—he was as anxious to conceal his identity as we"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,5,"are to discover it.” He looked down at the body again. “As before there are no finger-prints on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wore gloves.” “You think, then, that the murderer was the same in both cases?” I asked eagerly. Giraud became inscrutable. “Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!” The _sergent de ville___ appeared at the doorway. “Monsieur?” “Why is Madame Renauld not here? I sent for her a quarter of an hour ago?” “She is coming up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her.” “Good. I only want one at a time, though.” Marchaud saluted and disappeared again. A moment later he reappeared with Mrs. Renauld. “Here is Madame.” Giraud came forward with a curt bow. “This way, madame.” He led her across, and then, standing suddenly aside. “Here is the man. Do you know him?” And as he spoke, his eyes, gimlet-like, bored into her face, seeking to read her mind, noting every indication of her manner. But Mrs. Renauld remained perfectly calm—too calm, I felt. She looked down at the corpse almost without"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,6,"interest, certainly without any sign of agitation or recognition. “No,” she said. “I have never seen him in my life. He is quite a stranger to me.” “You are sure?” “Quite sure.” “You do not recognize in him one of your assailants, for instance?” “No,” she seemed to hesitate, as though struck by the idea. “No, I do not think so. Of course they wore beards—false ones the examining magistrate thought, but still—no.” Now she seemed to make her mind up definitely. “I am sure neither of the two was this man.” “Very well, madame. That is all, then.” She stepped out with head erect, the sun flashing on the silver threads in her hair. Jack Renauld succeeded her. He, too, failed to identify the man, in a completely natural manner. Giraud merely grunted. Whether he was pleased or chagrined I could not tell. He merely called to Marchaud: “You have got the other there?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Bring her in then.” “The other” was Madame Daubreuil. She came indignantly, protesting with vehemence. “I object, monsieur! This is an outrage! What have I to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,7,"do with all this?” “Madame,” said Giraud brutally, “I am investigating not one murder, but two murders! For all I know you may have committed them both.” “How dare you?” she cried. “How dare you insult me by such a wild accusation! It is infamous.” “Infamous, is it? What about this?” Stooping, he again detached the hair, and held it up. “Do you see this, madame?” He advanced towards her. “You permit that I see whether it matches?” With a cry she started backwards, white to the lips. “It is false—I swear it. I know nothing of the crime—of either crime. Any one who says I do lies! Ah! _mon Dieu___, what shall I do?” “Calm yourself, madame,” said Giraud coldly. “No one has accused you as yet. But you will do well to answer my questions without more ado.” “Anything you wish, monsieur.” “Look at the dead man. Have you ever seen him before?” Drawing nearer, a little of the colour creeping back to her face, Madame Daubreuil looked down at the victim with a certain amount of interest and curiosity. Then"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,8,"she shook her head. “I do not know him.” It seemed impossible to doubt her, the words came so naturally. Giraud dismissed her with a nod of the head. “You are letting her go?” I asked in a low voice. “Is that wise? Surely that black hair is from her head.” “I do not need teaching my business,” said Giraud dryly. “She is under surveillance. I have no wish to arrest her as yet.” Then, frowning, he gazed down at the body. “Should you say that was a Spanish type at all?” he asked suddenly. I considered the face carefully. “No,” I said at last. “I should put him down as a Frenchman most decidedly.” Giraud gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. “Same here.” He stood there for a moment, then with an imperative gesture he waved me aside, and once more, on hands and knees, he continued his search of the floor of the shed. He was marvellous. Nothing escaped him. Inch by inch he went over the floor, turning over pots, examining old sacks. He pounced on a bundle by the door,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,9,"but it proved to be only a ragged coat and trousers, and he flung it down again with a snarl. Two pairs of old gloves interested him, but in the end he shook his head and laid them aside. Then he went back to the pots, methodically turning them over one by one. In the end, he rose to his feet, and shook his head thoughtfully. He seemed baffled and perplexed. I think he had forgotten my presence. But, at that moment, a stir and bustle was heard outside, and our old friend, the examining magistrate, accompanied by his clerk and M. Bex, with the doctor behind him, came bustling in. “But this is extraordinary, Mr. Giraud,” cried M. Hautet. “Another crime! Ah, we have not got to the bottom of this case. There is some deep mystery here. But who is the victim this time?” “That is just what nobody can tell us, M. le juge. He has not been identified.” “Where is the body?” asked the doctor. Giraud moved aside a little. “There in the corner. He has been stabbed to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,14,14 The Second Body,10,"the heart, as you see. And with the dagger that was stolen yesterday morning. I fancy that the murder followed hard upon the theft—but that is for you to say. You can handle the dagger freely—there are no finger-prints on it.” The doctor knelt down by the dead man, and Giraud turned to the examining magistrate. “A pretty little problem, is it not? But I shall solve it.” “And so no one can identify him,” mused the magistrate. “Could it possibly be one of the assassins? They may have fallen out among themselves.” Giraud shook his head. “The man is a Frenchman—I would take my oath of that—” But at that moment they were interrupted by the doctor who was sitting back on his heels with a perplexed expression. “You say he was killed yesterday morning?” “I fix it by the theft of the dagger,” explained Giraud. “He may, of course, have been killed later in the day.” “Later in the day? Fiddlesticks! This man has been dead at least forty-eight hours, and probably longer.” We stared at each other in blank amazement."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,1,"The doctor’s words were so surprising that we were all momentarily taken aback. Here was a man stabbed with a dagger which we knew to have been stolen only twenty-four hours previously, and yet Dr. Durand asserted positively that he had been dead at least forty-eight hours! The whole thing was fantastic to the last extreme. We were still recovering from the surprise of the doctor’s announcement, when a telegram was brought to me. It had been sent up from the hotel to the Villa. I tore it open. It was from Poirot, and announced his return by the train arriving at Merlinville at 12:28. I looked at my watch and saw that I had just time to get comfortably to the station and meet him there. I felt that it was of the utmost importance that he should know at once of the new and startling developments in the case. Evidently, I reflected, Poirot had had no difficulty in finding what he wanted in Paris. The quickness of his return proved that. Very few hours had sufficed. I wondered how he would take the exciting news I had to impart. The train was some minutes late, and I strolled aimlessly up and down the platform, until it occurred to me that I might"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,2,"pass the time by asking a few questions as to who had left Merlinville by the last train on the evening of the tragedy. I approached the chief porter, an intelligent looking man, and had little difficulty in persuading him to enter upon the subject. It was a disgrace to the Police, he hotly affirmed, that such brigands of assassins should be allowed to go about unpunished. I hinted that there was some possibility they might have left by the midnight train, but he negatived the idea decidedly. He would have noticed two foreigners—he was sure of it. Only about twenty people had left by the train, and he could not have failed to observe them. I do not know what put the idea into my head—possibly it was the deep anxiety underlying Marthe Daubreuil’s tones—but I asked suddenly: “Young M. Renauld—he did not leave by that train, did he?” “Ah, no, monsieur. To arrive and start off again within half an hour, it would not be amusing, that!” I stared at the man, the significance of his words almost escaping me. Then I saw.… “You mean,” I said, my heart beating a little, “that M. Jack Renauld arrived at Merlinville that evening?” “But yes, monsieur. By the last train arriving the other way,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,3,"the 11:40.” My brain whirled. That, then, was the reason of Marthe’s poignant anxiety. Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime! But why had he not said so? Why, on the contrary, had he led us to believe that he had remained in Cherbourg? Remembering his frank boyish countenance, I could hardly bring myself to believe that he had any connection with the crime. Yet why this silence on his part about so vital a matter? One thing was certain, Marthe had known all along. Hence her anxiety, and her eager questioning of Poirot to know whether any one were suspected. My cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the train, and in another moment I was greeting Poirot. The little man was radiant. He beamed and vociferated and, forgetting my English reluctance, embraced me warmly on the platform. “_Mon cher ami___, I have succeeded—but succeeded to a marvel!” “Indeed? I’m delighted to hear it. Have you heard the latest here?” “How would you that I should hear anything? There have been some developments, eh? The brave Giraud, he has made an arrest? Or even arrests perhaps? Ah, but I will make him look foolish, that one! But where are you taking me, my friend? Do we not go"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,4,"to the hotel? It is necessary that I attend to my moustaches—they are deplorably limp from the heat of travelling. Also, without doubt, there is dust on my coat. And my tie, that I must rearrange.” I cut short his remonstrances. “My dear Poirot—never mind all that. We must go to the Villa at once. _There has been another murder!___” I have frequently been disappointed when fancying that I was giving news of importance to my friend. Either he has known it already or he has dismissed it as irrelevant to the main issue—and in the latter case events have usually proved him justified. But this time I could not complain of missing my effect. Never have I seen a man so flabbergasted. His jaw dropped. All the jauntiness went out of his bearing. He stared at me open-mouthed. “What is that you say? Another murder? Ah, then, I am all wrong. I have failed. Giraud may mock himself at me—he will have reason!” “You did not expect it, then?” “I? Not the least in the world. It demolishes my theory—it ruins everything—it—ah, no!” He stopped dead, thumping himself on the chest. “It is impossible. I _cannot___ be wrong! The facts, taken methodically and in their proper order admit of only one explanation. I"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,5,"must be right! I _am___ right!” “But then—” He interrupted me. “Wait, my friend. I must be right, therefore this new murder is impossible unless—unless—oh, wait, I implore you. Say no word—” He was silent for a moment or two, then, resuming his normal manner, he said in a quiet assured voice: “The victim is a man of middle-age. His body was found in the locked shed near the scene of the crime and had been dead at least forty-eight hours. And it is most probable that he was stabbed in a similar manner to M. Renauld, though not necessarily in the back.” It was my turn to gape—and gape I did. In all my knowledge of Poirot he had never done anything so amazing as this. And, almost inevitably, a doubt crossed my mind. “Poirot,” I cried, “you’re pulling my leg. You’ve heard all about it already.” He turned his earnest gaze upon me reproachfully. “Would I do such a thing? I assure you that I have heard nothing whatsoever. Did you not observe the shock your news was to me?” “But how on earth could you know all that?” “I was right then? But I knew it. The little grey cells, my friend, the little grey cells! They told me. Thus, and"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,6,"in no other way, could there have been a second death. Now tell me all. If we go round to the left here, we can take a short cut across the golf links which will bring us to the back of the Villa Geneviève much more quickly.” As we walked, taking the way he had indicated, I recounted all I knew. Poirot listened attentively. “The dagger was in the wound, you say? That is curious. You are sure it was the same one?” “Absolutely certain. That’s what make it so impossible.” “Nothing is impossible. There may have been two daggers.” I raised my eyebrows. “Surely that is in the highest degree unlikely? It would be a most extraordinary coincidence.” “You speak as usual, without reflection, Hastings. In some cases two identical weapons _would___ be highly improbable. But not here. This particular weapon was a war souvenir which was made to Jack Renauld’s orders. It is really highly unlikely, when you come to think of it, that he should have had only one made. Very probably he would have another for his own use.” “But nobody has mentioned such a thing,” I objected. A hint of the lecturer crept into Poirot’s tone. “My friend, in working upon a case, one does not take into account"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,7,"only the things that are ‘mentioned.’ There is no reason to mention many things which may be important. Equally, there is often an excellent reason for _not___ mentioning them. You can take your choice of the two motives.” I was silent, impressed in spite of myself. Another few minutes brought us to the famous shed. We found all our friends there and, after an interchange of polite amenities, Poirot began his task. Having watched Giraud at work, I was keenly interested. Poirot bestowed but a cursory glance on the surroundings. The only thing he examined was the ragged coat and trousers by the door. A disdainful smile rose to Giraud’s lips, and, as though noting it, Poirot flung the bundle down again. “Old clothes of the gardener’s?” he queried. “Exactly,” said Giraud. Poirot knelt down by the body. His fingers were rapid but methodical. He examined the texture of the clothes, and satisfied himself that there were no marks on them. The boots he subjected to special care, also the dirty and broken finger-nails. Whilst examining the latter he threw a quick question at Giraud. “You saw these?” “Yes, I saw them,” replied the other. His face remained inscrutable. Suddenly Poirot stiffened. “Dr. Durand!” “Yes?” The doctor came forward. “There is foam on the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,8,"lips. You observed it?” “I didn’t notice it, I must admit.” “But you observe it now?” “Oh, certainly.” Poirot again shot a question at Giraud. “You noticed it without doubt?” The other did not reply. Poirot proceeded. The dagger had been withdrawn from the wound. It reposed in a glass jar by the side of the body. Poirot examined it, then he studied the wound closely. When he looked up, his eyes were excited, and shone with the green light I knew so well. “It is a strange wound, this! It has not bled. There is no stain on the clothes. The blade of the dagger is slightly discoloured, that is all. What do you think, M. le docteur?” “I can only say that it is most abnormal.” “It is not abnormal at all. It is most simple. The man was stabbed _after he was dead___.” And, stilling the clamour of voices that arose with a wave of his hand, Poirot turned to Giraud and added, “M. Giraud agrees with me, do you not, monsieur?” Whatever Giraud’s real belief, he accepted the position without moving a muscle. Calmly and almost scornfully he replied: “Certainly I agree.” The murmur of surprise and interest broke out again. “But what an idea!” cried M. Hautet. “To stab"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,9,"a man after he is dead! Barbaric! Unheard of! Some unappeasable hate, perhaps.” “No, M. le juge,” said Poirot. “I should fancy it was done quite cold-bloodedly—to create an impression.” “What impression?” “The impression it nearly did create,” returned Poirot oracularly. M. Bex had been thinking. “How, then, was the man killed?” “He was not killed. He died. He died, M. le juge, if I am not much mistaken, of an epileptic fit!” This statement of Poirot’s again aroused considerable excitement. Dr. Durand knelt down again, and made a searching examination. At last he rose to his feet. “Well, M. le docteur?” “M. Poirot, I am inclined to believe that you are correct in your assertion. I was misled to begin with. The incontrovertible fact that the man had been stabbed distracted my attention from any other indications.” Poirot was the hero of the hour. The examining magistrate was profuse in compliments. Poirot responded gracefully, and then excused himself on the pretext that neither he nor I had yet lunched, and that he wished to repair the ravages of the journey. As we were about to leave the shed, Giraud approached us. “One more thing, M. Poirot,” he said, in his suave mocking voice. “We found this coiled round the handle of the dagger."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,15,15 A Photograph,10,"A woman’s hair.” “Ah!” said Poirot. “A woman’s hair? What woman’s, I wonder?” “I wonder also,” said Giraud. Then, with a bow, he left us. “He was insistent, the good Giraud,” said Poirot thoughtfully, as we walked towards the hotel. “I wonder in what direction he hopes to mislead me? A woman’s hair—h’m!” We lunched heartily, but I found Poirot somewhat distrait and inattentive. Afterwards we went up to our sitting-room and there I begged him to tell me something of his mysterious journey to Paris. “Willingly, my friend. I went to Paris to find _this___.” He took from his pocket a small faded newspaper cutting. It was the reproduction of a woman’s photograph. He handed it to me. I uttered an exclamation. “You recognize it, my friend?” I nodded. Although the photo obviously dated from very many years back, and the hair was dressed in a different style, the likeness was unmistakable. “Madame Daubreuil!” I exclaimed. Poirot shook his head with a smile. “Not quite correct, my friend. She did not call herself by that name in those days. That is a picture of the notorious Madame Beroldy!” Madame Beroldy! In a flash the whole thing came back to me. The murder trial that had evoked such world-wide interest. _The Beroldy Case.___"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,1,"Some twenty years or so before the opening of the present story, Monsieur Arnold Beroldy, a native of Lyons, arrived in Paris accompanied by his pretty wife and their little daughter, a mere babe. Monsieur Beroldy was a junior partner in a firm of wine merchants, a stout middle-aged man, fond of the good things of life, devoted to his charming wife, and altogether unremarkable in every way. The firm in which Monsieur Beroldy was a partner was a small one, and although doing well, it did not yield a large income to the junior partner. The Beroldys had a small apartment and lived in a very modest fashion to begin with. But unremarkable though Monsieur Beroldy might be, his wife was plentifully gilded with the brush of Romance. Young and good looking, and gifted withal with a singular charm of manner, Madame Beroldy at once created a stir in the quarter, especially when it began to be whispered that some interesting mystery surrounded her birth. It was rumoured that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,2,"she was the illegitimate daughter of a Russian Grand Duke. Others asserted that it was an Austrian Archduke, and that the union was legal, though morganatic. But all stories agreed upon one point, that Jeanne Beroldy was the centre of an interesting mystery. Questioned by the curious, Madame Beroldy did not deny these rumours. On the other hand she let it be clearly understood that, though her “lips” were “sealed,” all these stories had a foundation in fact. To intimate friends she unburdened herself further, spoke of political intrigues, of “papers,” of obscure dangers that threatened her. There was also much talk of Crown jewels that were to be sold secretly, with herself acting as the go-between. Amongst the friends and acquaintances of the Beroldys was a young lawyer, Georges Conneau. It was soon evident that the fascinating Jeanne had completely enslaved his heart. Madame Beroldy encouraged the young man in a discreet fashion, but being always careful to affirm her complete devotion to her middle-aged husband. Nevertheless, many spiteful"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,3,"persons did not hesitate to declare that young Conneau was her lover—and not the only one! When the Beroldys had been in Paris about three months, another personage came upon the scene. This was Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, a native of the United States, and extremely wealthy. Introduced to the charming and mysterious Madame Beroldy, he fell a prompt victim to her fascinations. His admiration was obvious, though strictly respectful. About this time, Madame Beroldy became more outspoken in her confidences. To several friends, she declared herself greatly worried on her husband’s behalf. She explained that he had been drawn into several schemes of a political nature, and also referred to some important papers that had been entrusted to him for safekeeping and which concerned a “secret” of far reaching European importance. They had been entrusted to his custody to throw pursuers off the track, but Madame Beroldy was nervous, having recognized several important members of the Revolutionary Circle in Paris. On the 28th day of November, the blow fell."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,4,"The woman who came daily to clean and cook for the Beroldys was surprised to find the door of the apartment standing wide open. Hearing faint moans issuing from the bedroom, she went in. A terrible sight met her eyes. Madame Beroldy lay on the floor, bound hand and foot, uttering feeble moans, having managed to free her mouth from a gag. On the bed was Monsieur Beroldy, lying in a pool of blood, with a knife driven through his heart. Madame Beroldy’s story was clear enough. Suddenly awakened from sleep, she had discerned two masked men bending over her. Stifling her cries, they had bound and gagged her. They had then demanded of Monsieur Beroldy the famous “secret.” But the intrepid wine merchant refused point-blank to accede to their request. Angered by his refusal, one of the men incontinently stabbed him through the heart. With the dead man’s keys, they had opened the safe in the corner, and had carried away with them a mass of papers. Both men"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,5,"were heavily bearded, and had worn masks, but Madame Beroldy declared positively that they were Russians. The affair created an immense sensation. It was referred to variously as “the Nihilist Atrocity,” “Revolutionaries in Paris,” and the “Russian Mystery.” Time went on, and the mysterious bearded men were never traced. And then, just as public interest was beginning to die down, a startling development occurred. Madame Beroldy was arrested and charged with the murder of her husband. The trial, when it came on, aroused widespread interest. The youth and beauty of the accused, and her mysterious history, were sufficient to make of it a _cause célèbre___. People ranged themselves wildly for or against the prisoner. But her partisans received several severe checks to their enthusiasm. The romantic past of Madame Beroldy, her royal blood, and the mysterious intrigues in which she had her being were shown to be mere fantasies of the imagination. It was proved beyond doubt that Jeanne Beroldy’s parents were a highly respectable and prosaic couple, fruit"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,6,"merchants, who lived on the outskirts of Lyons. The Russian Grand Duke, the court intrigues, and the political schemes—all the stories current were traced back to—the lady herself! From her brain had emanated these ingenious myths, and she was proved to have raised a considerable sum of money from various credulous persons by her fiction of the “Crown jewels”—the jewels in question being found to be mere paste imitations. Remorselessly the whole story of her life was laid bare. The motive for the murder was found in Mr. Hiram P. Trapp. Mr. Trapp did his best, but relentlessly and agilely cross-questioned he was forced to admit that he loved the lady, and that, had she been free, he would have asked her to be his wife. The fact that the relations between them were admittedly platonic strengthened the case against the accused. Debarred from becoming his mistress by the simple honourable nature of the man, Jeanne Beroldy had conceived the monstrous project of ridding herself of her elderly undistinguished"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,7,"husband, and becoming the wife of the rich American. Throughout, Madame Beroldy confronted her accusers with complete sang froid and self possession. Her story never varied. She continued to declare strenuously that she was of royal birth, and that she had been substituted for the daughter of the fruit seller at an early age. Absurd and completely unsubstantiated as these statements were, a great number of people believed implicitly in their truth. But the prosecution was implacable. It denounced the masked “Russians” as a myth, and asserted that the crime had been committed by Madame Beroldy and her lover, Georges Conneau. A warrant was issued for the arrest of the latter, but he had wisely disappeared. Evidence showed that the bonds which secured Madame Beroldy were so loose that she could easily have freed herself. And then, towards the close of the trial, a letter, posted in Paris, was sent to the Public Prosecutor. It was from Georges Conneau and, without revealing his whereabouts, it contained a full confession"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,8,"of the crime. He declared that he had indeed struck the fatal blow at Madame Beroldy’s instigation. The crime had been planned between them. Believing that her husband ill-treated her, and maddened by his own passion for her, a passion which he believed her to return, he had planned the crime and struck the fatal blow that should free the woman he loved from a hateful bondage. Now, for the first time, he learnt of Mr. Hiram P. Trapp, and realized that the woman he loved had betrayed him! Not for his sake did she wish to be free—but in order to marry the wealthy American. She had used him as a cat’s-paw, and now, in his jealous rage, he turned and denounced her, declaring that throughout he had acted at her instigation. And then Madame Beroldy proved herself the remarkable woman she undoubtedly was. Without hesitation, she dropped her previous defence, and admitted that the “Russians” were a pure invention on her part. The real murderer was Georges"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,9,"Conneau. Maddened by passion, he had committed the crime, vowing that if she did not keep silence he would enact a terrible vengeance from her. Terrified by his threats, she had consented—also fearing it likely that if she told the truth she might be accused of conniving at the crime. But she had steadfastly refused to have anything more to do with her husband’s murderer, and it was in revenge for this attitude on her part that he had written this letter accusing her. She swore solemnly that she had had nothing to do with the planning of the crime, that she had awoke on that memorable night to find Georges Conneau standing over her, the blood-stained knife in his hand. It was a touch and go affair. Madame Beroldy’s story was hardly credible. But this woman, whose fairy tales of royal intrigues had been so easily accepted, had the supreme art of making herself believed. Her address to the jury was a masterpiece. The tears streaming down her"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,16,16 The Beroldy Case,10,"face, she spoke of her child, of her woman’s honour—of her desire to keep her reputation untarnished for the child’s sake. She admitted that, Georges Conneau having been her lover, she might perhaps be held morally responsible for the crime—but, before God, nothing more! She knew that she had committed a grave fault in not denouncing Conneau to the law, but she declared in a broken voice that that was a thing no woman could have done.… She had loved him! Could she let her hand be the one to send him to the Guillotine? She had been guilty of much, but she was innocent of the terrible crime imputed to her. However that may have been, her eloquence and personality won the day. Madame Beroldy, amidst a scene of unparalleled excitement, was acquitted. Despite the utmost endeavours of the police, Georges Conneau was never traced. As for Madame Beroldy, nothing more was heard of her. Taking the child with her, she left Paris to begin a new life."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,1,"I have set down the Beroldy case in full. Of course all the details did not present themselves to my memory as I have recounted them here. Nevertheless, I recalled the case fairly accurately. It had attracted a great deal of interest at the time, and had been fully reported by the English papers, so that it did not need much effort of memory on my part to recollect the salient details. Just for the moment, in my excitement, it seemed to clear up the whole matter. I admit that I am impulsive, and Poirot deplores my custom of jumping to conclusions, but I think I had some excuse in this instance. The remarkable way in which this discovery justified Poirot’s point of view struck me at once. “Poirot,” I said, “I congratulate you. I see everything now.” “If that is indeed the truth, _I___ congratulate _you___, _mon ami___. For as a rule you are not famous for seeing—eh, is it not so?” I felt a little annoyed. “Come now, don’t rub it in. You’ve been so confoundedly mysterious all along with your hints and your insignificant details that any one might fail to see what you"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,2,"were driving at.” Poirot lit one of his little cigarettes with his usual precision. Then he looked up. “And since you see everything now, _mon ami___, what exactly is it that you see?” “Why, that it was Madame Daubreuil—Beroldy, who murdered Mr. Renauld. The similarity of the two cases proves that beyond a doubt.” “Then you consider that Madame Beroldy was wrongly acquitted? That in actual fact she was guilty of connivance in her husband’s murder?” I opened my eyes wide. “But of course! Don’t you?” Poirot walked to the end of the room, absentmindedly straightened a chair, and then said thoughtfully. “Yes, that is my opinion. But there is no ‘of course’ about it, my friend. Technically speaking, Madame Beroldy is innocent.” “Of that crime, perhaps. But not of this.” Poirot sat down again, and regarded me, his thoughtful air more marked than ever. “So it is definitely your opinion, Hastings, that Madame Daubreuil murdered M. Renauld?” “Yes.” “Why?” He shot the question at me with such suddenness that I was taken aback. “Why?” I stammered. “Why? Oh, because—” I came to a stop. Poirot nodded his head at me. “You see, you come to a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,3,"stumbling-block at once. Why should Madame Daubreuil (I shall call her that for clearness sake) murder M. Renauld? We can find no shadow of a motive. She does not benefit by his death; considered as either mistress or blackmailer she stands to lose. You cannot have a murder without a motive. The first crime was different, there we had a rich lover waiting to step into her husband’s shoes.” “Money is not the only motive for murder,” I objected. “True,” agreed Poirot placidly. “There are two others, the _crime passionnel___ is one. And there is the third rare motive, murder for an idea which implies some form of mental derangement on the part of the murderer. Homicidal mania, and religious fanaticism belong to that class. We can rule it out here.” “But what about the _crime passionnel?___ Can you rule that out? If Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, if she found that his affection was cooling, or if her jealousy was aroused in any way, might she not have struck him down in a moment of anger?” Poirot shook his head. “If—I say _if___, you note—Madame Daubreuil was Renauld’s mistress, he had not had time to tire"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,4,"of her. And in any case you mistake her character. She is a woman who can simulate great emotional stress. She is a magnificent actress. But, looked at dispassionately, her life disproves her appearance. Throughout, if we examine it, she had been cold-blooded and calculating in her motives and actions. It was not to link her life with that of her young lover that she connived at her husband’s murder. The rich American, for whom she probably did not care a button, was her objective. If she committed a crime, she would always do so for gain. Here there was no gain. Besides, how do you account for the digging of the grave? That was a man’s work.” “She might have had an accomplice,” I suggested, unwilling to relinquish my belief. “I pass to another objection. You have spoken of the similarity between the two crimes. Wherein does that lie, my friend?” I stared at him in astonishment. “Why, Poirot, it was you who remarked on that! The story of the masked men, the ‘secret,’ the papers!” Poirot smiled a little. “Do not be so indignant, I beg of you. I repudiate nothing. The similarity of the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,5,"two stories links the two cases together inevitably. But reflect now on something very curious. It is not Madame Daubreuil who tells us this tale—if it were all would indeed be plain sailing—it is Madame Renauld. Is she then in league with the other?” “I can’t believe that,” I said slowly. “If it is so, she must be the most consummate actress the world has ever known.” “Ta-ta-ta,” said Poirot impatiently. “Again you have the sentiment, and not the logic! If it is necessary for a criminal to be a consummate actress, then by all means assume her to be one. But is it necessary? I do not believe Madame Renauld to be in league with Madame Daubreuil for several reasons, some of which I have already enumerated to you. The others are self-evident. Therefore, that possibility eliminated, we draw very near to the truth which is, as always, very curious and interesting.” “Poirot,” I cried, “what more do you know?” “_Mon ami___, you must make your own deductions. You have ‘access to the facts!’ Concentrate your grey cells. Reason—not like Giraud—but like Hercule Poirot.” “But are you _sure?___” “My friend, in many ways I have been"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,6,"an imbecile. But at last I see clearly.” “You know everything?” “I have discovered what M. Renauld sent for me to discover.” “And you know the murderer?” “I know one murderer.” “What do you mean?” “We talk a little at cross-purposes. There are here not one crime, but two. The first I have solved, the second—_eh bien___, I will confess, I am not sure!” “But, Poirot, I thought you said the man in the shed had died a natural death?” “Ta-ta-ta.” Poirot made his favourite ejaculation of impatience. “Still you do not understand. One may have a crime without a murderer, but for two crimes it is essential to have two bodies.” His remark struck me as so peculiarly lacking in lucidity that I looked at him in some anxiety. But he appeared perfectly normal. Suddenly he rose and strolled to the window. “Here he is,” he observed. “Who?” “M. Jack Renauld. I sent a note up to the Villa to ask him to come here.” That changed the course of my ideas, and I asked Poirot if he knew that Jack Renauld had been in Merlinville on the night of the crime. I had hoped to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,7,"catch my astute little friend napping, but as usual, he was omniscient. He, too, had inquired at the station. “And without doubt we are not original in the idea, Hastings. The excellent Giraud, he also has probably made his inquiries.” “You don’t think—” I said, and then stopped. “Ah, no, it would be too horrible!” Poirot looked inquiringly at me, but I said no more. It had just occurred to me that though there were seven women directly or indirectly connected with the case Mrs. Renauld, Madame Daubreuil and her daughter, the mysterious visitor, and the three servants—there was, with the exception of old Auguste who could hardly count, only one man—Jack Renauld. _And a man must have dug a grave.…___ I had no time to develop further the appalling idea that had occurred to me, for Jack Renauld was ushered into the room. Poirot greeted him in a business-like manner. “Take a seat, monsieur. I regret infinitely to derange you, but you will perhaps understand that the atmosphere of the Villa is not too congenial to me. M. Giraud and I do not see eye to eye about everything. His politeness to me has not been"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,8,"striking and you will comprehend that I do not intend any little discoveries I may make to benefit him in any way.” “Exactly, M. Poirot,” said the lad. “That fellow Giraud is an ill-conditioned brute, and I’d be delighted to see some one score at his expense.” “Then I may ask a little favour of you?” “Certainly.” “I will ask you to go to the railway station and take a train to the next station along the line, Abbalac. Ask there at the cloak-room whether two foreigners deposited a valise there on the night of the murder. It is a small station, and they are almost certain to remember. Will you do this?” “Of course I will,” said the boy, mystified, though ready for the task. “I and my friend, you comprehend, have business elsewhere,” explained Poirot. “There is a train in a quarter of an hour, and I will ask you not to return to the Villa, as I have no wish for Giraud to get an inkling of your errand.” “Very well, I will go straight to the station.” He rose to his feet. Poirot’s voice stopped him. “One moment, M. Renauld, there is"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,9,"one little matter that puzzles me. Why did you not mention to M. Hautet this morning that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?” Jack Renauld’s face went crimson. With an effort he controlled himself. “You have made a mistake. I was in Cherbourg, as I told the examining magistrate this morning.” Poirot looked at him, his eyes narrowed, cat-like, until they only showed a gleam of green. “Then it is a singular mistake that I have made there—for it is shared by the station staff. They say you arrived by the 11:40 train.” For a moment Jack Renauld hesitated, then he made up his mind. “And if I did? I suppose you do not mean to accuse me of participating in my father’s murder?” He asked the question haughtily, his head thrown back. “I should like an explanation of the reason that brought you here.” “That is simple enough. I came to see my fiancée, Mademoiselle Daubreuil. I was on the eve of a long voyage, uncertain as to when I should return. I wished to see her before I went, to assure her of my unchanging devotion.” “And you did see"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,17,17 We Make Further Investigations,10,"her?” Poirot’s eyes never left the other’s face. There was an appreciable pause before Renauld replied. Then he said: “Yes.” “And afterwards?” “I found I had missed the last train. I walked to St. Beauvais where I knocked up a garage and got a car to take me back to Cherbourg.” “St. Beauvais? That is fifteen kilometres. A long walk, M. Renauld.” “I—I felt like walking.” Poirot bowed his head as a sign that he accepted the explanation. Jack Renauld took up his hat and cane and departed. In a trice Poirot jumped to his feet. “Quick, Hastings. We will go after him.” Keeping a discreet distance behind our quarry, we followed him through the streets of Merlinville. But when Poirot saw that he took the turning to the station, he checked himself. “All is well. He has taken the bait. He will go to Abbalac, and will inquire for the mythical valise left by the mythical foreigners. Yes, _mon ami___, all that was a little invention of my own.” “You wanted him out of the way!” I exclaimed. “Your penetration is amazing, Hastings! Now, if you please, we will go up to the Villa Geneviève.”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,1,"“By the way, Poirot,” I said, as we walked along the hot white road, “I’ve got a bone to pick with you. I dare say you meant well, but really it was no business of yours to go mouching round to the Hôtel du Phare without letting me know.” Poirot shot a quick sidelong glance at me. “And how did you know I had been there?” he inquired. Much to my annoyance I felt the colour rising in my cheeks. “I happened to look in in passing,” I explained with as much dignity as I could muster. I rather feared Poirot’s banter, but to my relief, and somewhat to my surprise, he only shook his head with a rather unusual gravity. “If I have offended your susceptibilities in any way, I demand pardon of you. You will understand better soon. But, believe me, I have striven to concentrate all my energies on the case.” “Oh, it’s all right,” I said, mollified by the apology. “I know it’s only that you have my interests at heart. But I can"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,2,"take care of myself all right.” Poirot seemed to be about to say something further, but checked himself. Arrived at the Villa, Poirot led the way up to the shed where the second body had been discovered. He did not, however, go in, but paused by the bench which I have mentioned before as being set some few yards away from it. After contemplating it for a moment or two, he paced carefully from it to the hedge which marked the boundary between the Villa Geneviève and the Villa Marguerite. Then he paced back again, nodding his head as he did so. Returning again to the hedge, he parted the bushes with his hands. “With good fortune,” he remarked to me over his shoulder, “Mademoiselle Marthe may find herself in the garden. I desire to speak to her and would prefer not to call formally at the Villa Marguerite. Ah, all is well, there she is. Pst, mademoiselle! Pst! _Un moment, s’il vous plaît.___” I joined him at the moment that Marthe Daubreuil, looking slightly startled, came running"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,3,"up to the hedge at his call. “A little word with you, mademoiselle, if it is permitted?” “Certainly, Monsieur Poirot.” Despite her acquiescence, her eyes looked troubled and afraid. “Mademoiselle, do you remember running after me on the road the day that I came to your house with the examining magistrate? You asked me if any one were suspected of the crime.” “And you told me two Chilians.” Her voice sounded rather breathless, and her left hand stole to her breast. “Will you ask me the same question again, mademoiselle?” “What do you mean?” “This. If you were to ask me that question again, I should give you a different answer. Some one is suspected—but not a Chilian.” “Who?” The word came faintly between her parted lips. “M. Jack Renauld.” “What?” It was a cry. “Jack? Impossible. Who dares to suspect him?” “Giraud.” “Giraud!” The girl’s face was ashy. “I am afraid of that man. He is cruel. He will—he will—” She broke off. There was courage gathering in her face, and determination. I realized in that moment"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,4,"that she was a fighter. Poirot, too, watched her intently. “You know, of course, that he was here on the night of the murder?” he asked. “Yes,” she replied mechanically. “He told me.” “It was unwise to have tried to conceal the fact,” ventured Poirot. “Yes, yes,” she replied impatiently. “But we cannot waste time on regrets. We must find something to save him. He is innocent, of course, but that will not help him with a man like Giraud who has his reputation to think of. He must arrest some one, and that some one will be Jack.” “The facts will tell against him,” said Poirot. “You realize that?” She faced him squarely, and used the words I had heard her say in her mother’s drawing-room. “I am not a child, monsieur. I can be brave and look facts in the face. He is innocent, and we must save him.” She spoke with a kind of desperate energy, then was silent, frowning as she thought. “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot observing her keenly, “is there not something that you"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,5,"are keeping back that you could tell us?” She nodded perplexedly. “Yes, there is something, but I hardly know whether you will believe it—it seems so absurd.” “At any rate, tell us, mademoiselle.” “It is this. M. Giraud sent for me, as an afterthought, to see if I could identify the man in there.” She signed with her head towards the shed. “I could not. At least I could not at the moment. But since I have been thinking—” “Well?” “It seems so queer, and yet I am almost sure. I will tell you. On the morning of the day M. Renauld was murdered, I was walking in the garden here, when I heard a sound of men’s voices quarrelling. I pushed aside the bushes and looked through. One of the men was M. Renauld and the other was a tramp, a dreadful looking creature in filthy rags. He was alternately whining and threatening. I gathered he was asking for money, but at that moment _maman___ called me from the house, and I had to go. That is"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,6,"all, only—I am almost sure that the tramp and the dead man in the shed are one and the same.” Poirot uttered an exclamation. “But why did you not say so at the time, mademoiselle?” “Because at first it only struck me that the face was vaguely familiar in some way. The man was differently dressed, and apparently belonged to a superior station in life. But tell me, Monsieur Poirot, is it not possible that this tramp might have attacked and killed M. Renauld, and taken his clothes and money?” “It is an idea, mademoiselle,” said Poirot slowly. “It leaves a lot unexplained, but it is certainly an idea. I will think of it.” A voice called from the house. “_Maman___,” whispered Marthe, “I must go.” And she slipped away through the trees. “Come,” said Poirot, and taking my arm, turned in the direction of the Villa. “What do you really think?” I asked, in some curiosity. “Was that story true, or did the girl make it up in order to divert suspicion from her lover?” “It is"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,7,"a curious tale,” said Poirot, “but I believe it to be the absolute truth. Unwittingly, Mademoiselle Marthe told us the truth on another point—and incidentally gave Jack Renauld the lie. Did you notice his hesitation when I asked him if he saw Marthe Daubreuil on the night of the crime? He paused and then said ‘Yes.’ I suspected that he was lying. It was necessary for me to see Mademoiselle Marthe before he could put her on her guard. Three little words gave me the information I wanted. When I asked her if she knew that Jack Renauld was here that night, she answered ‘He _told___ me.’ Now, Hastings, what was Jack Renauld doing here on that eventful evening, and if he did not see Mademoiselle Marthe whom did he see?” “Surely, Poirot,” I cried, aghast, “you cannot believe that a boy like that would murder his own father.” “_Mon ami___,” said Poirot, “you continue to be of a sentimentality unbelievable! I have seen mothers who murdered their little children for the sake of the insurance money! After"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,8,"that, one can believe anything.” “And the motive?” “Money of course. Remember that Jack Renauld thought that he would come in to half his father’s fortune at the latter’s death.” “But the tramp. Where does he come in?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. “Giraud would say that he was an accomplice—an apache who helped young Renauld to commit the crime, and who was conveniently put out of the way afterwards.” “But the hair round the dagger? The woman’s hair?” “Ah,” said Poirot, smiling broadly. “That is the cream of Giraud’s little jest. According to him, it is not a woman’s hair at all. Remember that the youths of today wear their hair brushed straight back from the forehead with pomade or hairwash to make it lie flat. Consequently some of the hairs are of considerable length.” “And you believe that too?” “No,” said Poirot with a curious smile. “For I know it to be the hair of a woman—and more, which woman!” “Madame Daubreuil,” I announced positively. “Perhaps,” said Poirot, regarding me quizzically. But I refused to allow myself"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,9,"to get annoyed. “What are we going to do now?” I asked, as we entered the hall of the Villa Geneviève. “I wish to make a search amongst the effects of M. Jack Renauld. That is why I had to get him out of the way for a few hours.” “But will not Giraud have searched already?” I asked doubtfully. “Of course. He builds a case, as a beaver builds a dam, with a fatiguing industry. But he will not have looked for the things that I am seeking—in all probability he would not have seen their importance if they stared him in the face. Let us begin.” Neatly and methodically, Poirot opened each drawer in turn, examined the contents, and returned them exactly to their places. It was a singularly dull and uninteresting proceeding. Poirot waded on through collars, pajamas and socks. A purring noise outside drew me to the window. Instantly I became galvanized into life. “Poirot!” I cried. “A car has just driven up. Giraud is in it, and Jack Renauld, and two gendarmes.”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,18,18 Giraud Acts,10,"“_Sacré tonnerre!___” growled Poirot. “That animal of a Giraud, could he not wait? I shall not be able to replace the things in this last drawer with the proper method. Let us be quick.” Unceremoniously he tumbled out the things on the floor, mostly ties and handkerchiefs. Suddenly with a cry of triumph Poirot pounced on something, a small square cardboard, evidently a photograph. Thrusting it into his pocket, he returned the things pell-mell to the drawer, and seizing me by the arm dragged me out of the room and down the stairs. In the hall stood Giraud, contemplating his prisoner. “Good afternoon, M. Giraud,” said Poirot. “What have we here?” Giraud nodded his head towards Jack. “He was trying to make a getaway, but I was too sharp for him. He is under arrest for the murder of his father, M. Paul Renauld.” Poirot wheeled to confront the boy who leaned limply against the door, his face ashy pale. “What do you say to that, _jeune homme?___” Jack Renauld stared at him stonily. “Nothing,” he said."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,1,"I was dumbfounded. Up to the last, I had not been able bring myself to believe Jack Renauld guilty. I had expected a ringing proclamation of his innocence when Poirot challenged him. But now, watching him as he stood, white and limp against the wall, and hearing the damning admission fall from his lips, I doubted no longer. But Poirot had turned to Giraud. “What are your grounds for arresting him?” “Do you expect me to give them to you?” “As a matter of courtesy, yes.” Giraud looked at him doubtfully. He was torn between a desire to refuse rudely and the pleasure of triumphing over his adversary. “You think I have made a mistake, I suppose?” he sneered. “It would not surprise me,” replied Poirot, with a soupçon of malice. Giraud’s face took on a deeper tinge of red. “_Eh bien___, come in here. You shall judge for yourself.” He flung open"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,2,"the door of the _salon___, and we passed in, leaving Jack Renauld in the care of the two other men. “Now, M. Poirot,” said Giraud laying his hat on the table, and speaking with the utmost sarcasm, “I will treat you to a little lecture on detective work. I will show you how we moderns work.” “_Bien!___” said Poirot, composing himself to listen. “I will show you how admirably the Old Guard can listen,” and he leaned back and closed his eyes, opening them for a moment to remark. “Do not fear that I shall sleep. I will attend most carefully.” “Of course,” began Giraud, “I soon saw through all that Chilian tomfoolery. Two men were in it—but they were not mysterious foreigners! All that was a blind.” “Very creditable so far, my dear Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “Especially after that clever trick of theirs with the match and cigarette end.” Giraud glared, but"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,3,"continued: “A man must have been connected with the case, in order to dig the grave. There is no man who actually benefits by the crime, but there was a man who thought he would benefit. I heard of Jack Renauld’s quarrel with his father, and of the threats that he had used. The motive was established. Now as to means. Jack Renauld was in Merlinville that night. He concealed the fact—which turned suspicion into certainty. Then we found a second victim—_stabbed with the same dagger___. We know when that dagger was stolen. Captain Hastings here can fix the time. Jack Renauld, arriving from Cherbourg, was the only person who could have taken it. I have accounted for all the other members of the household.” Poirot interrupted: “You are wrong. There is one other person who could have taken the dagger.” “You refer to M. Stonor? He arrived at the front door, in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,4,"an automobile which had brought him straight from Calais. Ah, believe me, I have looked into everything. M. Jack Renauld arrived by train. An hour elapsed between his arrival, and the moment he presented himself at the house. Without doubt, he saw Captain Hastings and his companion leave the shed, slipped in himself and took the dagger, stabbed his accomplice in the shed—” “Who was already dead!” Giraud shrugged his shoulders. “Possibly he did not observe that. He may have judged him to be sleeping. Without doubt they had a rendezvous. In any case he knew this apparent second murder would greatly complicate the case. It did.” “But it could not deceive M. Giraud,” murmured Poirot. “You mock yourself at me. But I will give you one last irrefutable proof. Madame Renauld’s story was false—a fabrication from beginning to end. We believe Madame Renauld to have loved her husband—_yet she lied to shield"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,5,"his murderer___. For whom will a woman lie? Sometimes for herself, usually for the man she loves, _always___ for her children. That is the last—the irrefutable proof. You cannot get round it.” Giraud paused, flushed and triumphant. Poirot regarded him steadily. “That is my case,” said Giraud. “What have you to say to it?” “Only that there is one thing you have failed to take into account.” “What is that?” “Jack Renauld was presumably acquainted with the planning out of the golf course. He knew that the body would be discovered almost at once, when they started to dig the bunker.” Giraud laughed out loud. “But it is idiotic what you say there! He wanted the body to be found! Until it was found, he could not presume death, and would have been unable to enter into his inheritance.” I saw a quick flash of green in Poirot’s eyes as he rose to"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,6,"his feet. “Then why bury it?” he asked softly. “Reflect, Giraud. Since it was to Jack Renauld’s advantage that the body should be found without delay, _why dig a grave at all?___” Giraud did not reply. The question found him unprepared. He shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that it was of no importance. Poirot moved towards the door. I followed him. “There is one more thing that you have failed to take into account,” he said over his shoulder. “What is that?” “The piece of lead piping,” said Poirot, and left the room. Jack Renauld still stood in the hall, with a white dumb face, but as we came out of the _salon___, he looked up sharply. At the same moment there was the sound of a footfall on the staircase. Mrs. Renauld was descending it. At the sight of her son, standing between the two myrmidons of the law, she"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,7,"stopped as though petrified. “Jack,” she faltered. “Jack, what is this?” He looked up at her, his face set. “They have arrested me, mother.” “What?” She uttered a piercing cry, and before any one could get to her swayed and fell heavily. We both ran to her and lifted her up. In a minute Poirot stood up again. “She has cut her head badly, on the corner of the stairs. I fancy there is a slight concussion also. If Giraud wants a statement from her, he will have to wait. She will probably be unconscious for at least a week.” Denise and Françoise had run to their mistress, and leaving her in their charge Poirot left the house. He walked with his head bent down, frowning thoughtfully at the ground. For some time I did not speak, but at last I ventured to put a question to him. “Do you believe then, in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,8,"spite of all appearances to the contrary, that Jack Renauld may not be guilty?” Poirot did not answer at once, but after a long wait he said gravely: “I do not know, Hastings. There is just a chance of it. Of course Giraud is all wrong—wrong from beginning to end. If Jack Renauld is guilty, it is in spite of Giraud’s arguments, not _because___ of them. And the gravest indictment against him is known only to me.” “What is that?” I asked, impressed. “If you would use your grey cells, and see the whole case clearly as I do, you too would perceive it, my friend.” This was what I called one of Poirot’s irritating answers. He went on, without waiting for me to speak. “Let us walk this way to the sea. We will sit on that little mound there, overlooking the beach, and review the case. You shall know all that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,9,"I know, but I would prefer that you should come at the truth by your own efforts—not by my leading you by the hand.” We established ourselves on the grassy knoll as Poirot had suggested, looking out to sea. From farther along the sand, the cries of the bathers reached us faintly. The sea was of the palest blue, and the halcyon calm reminded me of the day we had arrived at Merlinville, my own good spirits, and Poirot’s suggestion that I was “fey.” What a long time seemed to have elapsed since then. And in reality it was only three days! “Think, my friend,” said Poirot’s voice encouragingly. “Arrange your ideas. Be methodical. Be orderly. There is the secret of success.” I endeavoured to obey him, casting my mind back over all the details of the case. And reluctantly it seemed to me that the only clear and possible solution was that"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,19,19 I Use My Grey Cells,10,"of Giraud—which Poirot despised. I reflected anew. If there was daylight anywhere it was in the direction of Madame Daubreuil. Giraud was ignorant of her connection with the Beroldy Case. Poirot had declared the Beroldy Case to be all important. It was there I must seek. I was on the right track now. And suddenly I started as an idea of bewildering luminosity shot into my brain. Trembling I built up my hypothesis. “You have a little idea, I see, _mon ami!___ Capital. We progress.” I sat up, and lit a pipe. “Poirot,” I said, “it seems to me we have been strangely remiss. I say we—although I dare say _I___ would be nearer the mark. But you must pay the penalty of your determined secrecy. So I say again we have been strangely remiss. There is some one we have forgotten.” “And who is that?” inquired Poirot, with twinkling eyes. “Georges Conneau!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,1,"The next moment Poirot embraced me warmly. “_Enfin!___ You have arrived. And all by yourself. It is superb! Continue your reasoning. You are right. Decidedly we have done wrong to forget Georges Conneau.” I was so flattered by the little man’s approval that I could hardly continue. But at last I collected my thoughts and went on. “Georges Conneau disappeared twenty years ago, but we have no reason to believe that he is dead.” “_Aucunement___,” agreed Poirot. “Proceed.” “Therefore we will assume that he is alive.” “Exactly.” “Or that he was alive until recently.” “_De mieux en mieux!___” “We will presume,” I continued, my enthusiasm rising, “that he has fallen on evil days. He has become a criminal, an apache, a tramp—a what you will. He chances to come to Merlinville. There he finds the woman he has never ceased to love.” “Eh eh! The sentimentality,” warned Poirot. “Where one hates one also loves,” I quoted or misquoted. “At any rate he finds her there, living under an assumed name. But she has a new lover, the Englishman, Renauld. Georges Conneau, the memory of old wrongs rising in him, quarrels with this Renauld. He lies in wait for him as he comes to visit his mistress, and stabs him in the back. Then, terrified at what he has done, he starts to dig a grave. I imagine it likely that Madame Daubreuil comes out to look for her lover. She and Conneau have a terrible scene. He drags her into the shed, and there suddenly falls down in an epileptic fit. Now supposing Jack Renauld to appear. Madame Daubreuil tells him all, points out to him the dreadful consequences to her daughter if"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,2,"this scandal of the past is revived. His father’s murderer is dead—let them do their best to hush it up. Jack Renauld consents—goes to the house and has an interview with his mother, winning her over to his point of view. Primed with the story that Madame Daubreuil has suggested to him, she permits herself to be gagged and bound. There, Poirot, what do you think of that?” I leaned back, flushed with the pride of successful reconstruction. Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “I think that you should write for the Kinema, _mon ami___,” he remarked at last. “You mean—?” “It would make a good film, the story that you have recounted to me there—but it bears no sort of resemblance to everyday life.” “I admit that I haven’t gone into all the details, but—” “You have gone further—you have ignored them magnificently. What about the way the two men were dressed? Do you suggest that after stabbing his victim, Conneau removed his suit of clothes, donned it himself, and replaced the dagger?” “I don’t see that that matters,” I objected rather huffily. “He may have obtained clothes and money from Madame Daubreuil by threats earlier in the day.” “By threats—eh? You seriously advance that supposition?” “Certainly. He could have threatened to reveal her identity to the Renaulds, which would probably have put an end to all hopes of her daughter’s marriage.” “You are wrong, Hastings. He could not blackmail her, for she had the whip hand. Georges Conneau, remember, is still wanted for murder. A word from her and he is in danger of the guillotine.” I was forced, rather reluctantly, to admit the truth of this. “_Your___ theory,” I remarked acidly,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,3,"“is doubtless correct as to all the details?” “My theory is the truth,” said Poirot quietly. “And the truth is necessarily correct. In your theory you made a fundamental error. You permitted your imagination to lead you astray with midnight assignations and passionate love scenes. But in investigating crime we must take our stand upon the commonplace. Shall I demonstrate my methods to you?” “Oh, by all means let us have a demonstration!” Poirot sat very upright and began, wagging his forefinger emphatically to emphasize his points. “I will start as you started from the basic fact of Georges Conneau. Now the story told by Madame Beroldy in court as to the ‘Russians’ was admittedly a fabrication. If she was innocent of connivance in the crime, it was concocted by her, and by her only as she stated. If, on the other hand, she was not innocent, it might have been invented by either her or Georges Conneau. “Now in this case we are investigating, we meet the same tale. As I pointed out to you, the facts render it very unlikely that Madame Daubreuil inspired it. So we turn to the hypothesis that the story had its origin in the brain of Georges Conneau. Very good. Georges Conneau, therefore, planned the crime with Madame Renauld as his accomplice. She is in the limelight, and behind her is a shadowy figure whose alias is unknown to us. “Now let us go carefully over the Renauld Case from the beginning, setting down each significant point in its chronological order. You have a notebook and pencil? Good. Now what is the earliest point to note down?” “The letter to you?” “That was the first we"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,4,"knew of it, but it is not the proper beginning of the case. The first point of any significance, I should say, is the change that came over M. Renauld shortly after arriving in Merlinville, and which is attested to by several witnesses. We have also to consider his friendship with Madame Daubreuil, and the large sums of money paid over to her. From thence we can come directly to the 23rd May.” Poirot paused, cleared his throat, and signed to me to write. “_23rd May.___ M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. “_24th May.___ M. Renauld alters his will, leaving entire control of his fortune in his wife’s hands. “_7th June.___ Quarrel with tramp in garden, witnessed by Marthe Daubreuil. “Letter written to M. Hercule Poirot, imploring assistance. “Telegram sent to Jack Renauld, bidding him proceed by the _Anzora___ to Buenos Ayres. “Chauffeur, Masters, sent off on a holiday. “Visit of a lady, that evening. As he is seeing her out, his words are ‘Yes, yes—but for God’s sake go now.…’” Poirot paused. “There, Hastings, take each of those facts one by one, consider them carefully by themselves and in relation to the whole, and see if you do not get new light on the matter.” I endeavoured conscientiously to do as he had said. After a moment or two, I said rather doubtfully: “As to the first points, the question seems to be whether we adopt the theory of blackmail, or of an infatuation for this woman.” “Blackmail, decidedly. You heard what Stonor said as to his character and habits.” “Mrs. Renauld did not confirm his view,” I argued. “We"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,5,"have already seen that Madame Renauld’s testimony cannot be relied upon in any way. We must trust to Stonor on that point.” “Still, if Renauld had an affair with a woman called Bella, there seems no inherent improbability in his having another with Madame Daubreuil.” “None whatever, I grant you, Hastings. But did he?” “The letter, Poirot. You forget the letter.” “No, I do not forget. But what makes you think that letter was written to M. Renauld?” “Why it was found in his pocket and—and—” “And that is all!” cut in Poirot. “There was no mention of any name to show to whom the letter was addressed. We assumed it was to the dead man because it was in the pocket of his overcoat. Now, _mon ami___, something about that overcoat struck me as unusual. I measured it, and made the remark that he wore his overcoat very long. That remark should have given you to think.” “I thought you were just saying it for the sake of saying something,” I confessed. “Ah, _quelle idée!___ Later you observed me measuring the overcoat of M. Jack Renauld. _Eh bien___, M. Jack Renauld wears his overcoat very short. Put those two facts together with a third, namely that M. Jack Renauld flung out of the house in a hurry on his departure for Paris, and tell me what you make of it!” “I see,” I said slowly, as the meaning of Poirot’s remarks bore in upon me. “That letter was written to Jack Renauld—not to his father. He caught up the wrong overcoat in his haste and agitation.” Poirot nodded. “_Précisement!___ We can return to this point later. For the moment let us"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,6,"content ourselves with accepting the letter as having nothing to do with M. Renauld _père___, and pass to the next chronological event.” “May 23rd,” I read, “M. Renauld quarrels with his son over latter’s wish to marry Marthe Daubreuil. Son leaves for Paris. I don’t see anything much to remark upon there, and the altering of the will the following day seems straightforward enough. It was the direct result of the quarrel.” “We agree, _mon ami___—at least as to the cause. But what exact motive underlay this procedure of M. Renauld’s?” I opened my eyes in surprise. “Anger against his son of course.” “Yet he wrote him affectionate letters to Paris?” “So Jack Renauld says, but he cannot produce them.” “Well, let us pass from that.” “Now we come to the day of the tragedy. You have placed the events of the morning in a certain order. Have you any justification for that?” “I have ascertained that the letter to me was posted at the same time as the telegram was despatched. Masters was informed he could take a holiday shortly afterwards. In my opinion the quarrel with the tramp took place anterior to these happenings.” “I do not see that you can fix that definitely—unless you question Mademoiselle Dabreuil again.” “There is no need. I am sure of it. And if you do not see that, you see nothing, Hastings!” I looked at him for a moment. “Of course! I am an idiot. If the tramp was Georges Conneau, it was after the stormy interview with him that Mr. Renauld apprehended danger. He sent away the chauffeur, Masters, whom he suspected of being in the other’s pay, he wired to his"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,7,"son, and sent for you.” A faint smile crossed Poirot’s lips. “You do not think it strange that he should use exactly the same expressions in his letter as Madame Renauld used later in her story? If the mention of Santiago was a blind, why should Renauld speak of it, and—what is more—send his son there?” “It is puzzling, I admit, but perhaps we shall find some explanation later. We come now to the evening, and the visit of the mysterious lady. I confess that that fairly baffles me, unless it was Madame Daubreuil, as Françoise all along maintained.” Poirot shook his head. “My friend, my friend, where are your wits wandering? Remember the fragment of cheque, and the fact that the name Bella Duveen was faintly familiar to Stonor, and I think we may take it for granted that Bella Duveen is the full name of Jack’s unknown correspondent, and that it was she who came to the Villa Geneviève that night. Whether she intended to see Jack, or whether she meant all along to appeal to his father we cannot be certain, but I think we may assume that this is what occurred. She produced her claim upon Jack, probably showed letters that he had written her, and the older man tried to buy her off by writing a cheque. This she indignantly tore up. The terms of her letter are those of a woman genuinely in love, and she would probably deeply resent being offered money. In the end he got rid of her, and here the words that he used are significant.” “‘Yes, yes, but for God’s sake go now,’” I repeated. “They seem to me a little"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,8,"vehement, perhaps, that is all.” “That is enough. He was desperately anxious for the girl to go. Why? Not only because the interview was unpleasant. No, it was the time that was slipping by, and for some reason time was precious.” “Why should it be?” I asked, bewildered. “That is what we ask ourselves. Why should it be? But later we have the incident of the wrist watch—which again shows us that time plays a very important part in the crime. We are now fast approaching the actual drama. It is half-past ten when Bella Duveen leaves, and by the evidence of the wrist watch we know that the crime was committed, or at any rate that it was staged, before twelve o’clock. We have reviewed all the events anterior to the murder, there remains only one unplaced. By the doctor’s evidence, the tramp, when found, had been dead at least forty-eight hours—with a possible margin of twenty-four hours more. Now, with no other facts to help me than those we have discussed, I place the death as having occurred on the morning of June 7th.” I stared at him, stupefied. “But how? Why? How can you possibly know?” “Because only in that way can the sequence of events be logically explained. _Mon ami___, I have taken you step by step along the way. Do you not now see what is so glaringly plain?” “My dear Poirot, I can’t see anything glaring about it. I did think I was beginning to see my way before, but I’m now hopelessly fogged.” Poirot looked at me sadly, and shook his head. “_Mon Dieu!___ But it is _triste!___ A good intelligence—and so deplorably lacking in"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,9,"method. There is an exercise most excellent for the development of the little grey cells. I will impart it to you—” “For Heaven’s sake, not now! You really are the most irritating of fellows, Poirot. For goodness’ sake, get on and tell me who killed M. Renauld.” “That is just what I am not sure of as yet.” “But you said it was glaringly clear?” “We talk at cross-purposes, my friend. Remember, it is two crimes we are investigating—for which, as I pointed out to you, we have the necessary two bodies. There, there, _ne vous impatientez pas!___ I explain all. To begin with, we apply our psychology. We find three points at which M. Renauld displays a distinct change of view and action—three psychological points therefore. The first occurs immediately after arriving in Merlinville, the second after quarrelling with his son on a certain subject, the third on the morning of June 7th. Now for the three causes. We can attribute No. 1 to meeting Madame Daubreuil. No. 2 is indirectly connected with her since it concerns a marriage between M. Renauld’s son and her daughter. But the cause of No. 3 is hidden from us. We have to deduce it. Now, _mon ami___, let me ask you a question; who do we believe to have planned this crime?” “Georges Conneau,” I said doubtfully, eyeing Poirot warily. “Exactly. Now Giraud laid it down as an axiom that a woman lies to save herself, the man she loves, and her child. Since we are satisfied that was Georges Conneau who dictated the lie to her, and as Georges Conneau is not Jack Renauld, follows that the third case is put out of"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,20,20 An Amazing Statement,10,"court. And, still attributing the crime to Georges Conneau, the first is equally so. So we are forced to the second—that Madame Renauld lied for the sake of the man she loved—or in other words, for the sake of Georges Conneau. You agree to that.” “Yes,” I admitted. “It seems logical enough.” “_Bien!___ Madame Renauld loves Georges Conneau. Who, then, is Georges Conneau?” “The tramp.” “Have we any evidence to show that Madame Renauld loved the tramp?” “No, but—” “Very well then. Do not cling to theories where facts no longer support them. Ask yourself instead who Madame Renauld _did___ love.” I shook my head perplexed. “_Mais, oui___, you know perfectly. Who did Madame Renauld love so dearly that when she saw his dead body, she fell down in a swoon?” I stared dumbfounded. “Her husband?” I gasped. Poirot nodded. “Her husband—or Georges Conneau, whichever you like to call him.” I rallied myself. “But it’s impossible.” “How ‘impossible?’ Did we not agree just now that Madame Daubreuil was in a position to blackmail Georges Conneau?” “Yes, but—” “And did she not very effectively blackmail M. Renauld?” “That may be true enough, but—” “And is it not a fact that we know nothing of M. Renauld’s youth and upbringing? That he springs suddenly into existence as a French Canadian exactly twenty-two years ago?” “All that is so,” I said more firmly, “but you seem to me to be overlooking one salient point.” “What is it, my friend?” “Why, we have admitted Georges Conneau planned the crime. That brings us to the ridiculous statement that he planned his own murder!” “_Eh bien, mon ami___,” said Poirot placidly, “that is just what he did do!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,1,"In a measured voice, Poirot began his exposition. “It seems strange to you, _mon ami___, that a man should plan his own death? So strange, that you prefer to reject the truth as fantastic, and to revert to a story that is in reality ten times more impossible. Yes, M. Renauld planned his own death, but there is one detail that perhaps escapes you—he did not intend to die.” I shook my head, bewildered. “But no, it is all most simple really,” said Poirot kindly. “For the crime that M. Renauld proposed a murderer was not necessary, as I told you, but a body was. Let us reconstruct, seeing events this time from a different angle. “Georges Conneau flies from justice—to Canada. There, under an assumed name he marries, and finally acquires a vast fortune in South America. But there is a nostalgia upon him for his own country. Twenty years have elapsed, he is considerably changed in appearance, besides being a man of such eminence that no one is likely to connect him with a fugitive from justice many years ago. He deems it quite safe to return. He takes up his headquarters in England, but intends to spend the summers in France. And ill fortune, that obscure justice which shapes men’s ends, and will not allow them to evade the consequences of their"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,2,"acts, takes him to Merlinville. There, in the whole of France, is the one person who is capable of recognizing him. It is, of course, a gold mine to Madame Daubreuil, and a gold mine of which she is not slow to take advantage. He is helpless, absolutely in her power. And she bleeds him heavily. “And then the inevitable happens. Jack Renauld falls in love with the beautiful girl he sees almost daily, and wishes to marry her. That rouses his father. At all costs, he will prevent his son marrying the daughter of this evil woman. Jack Renauld knows nothing of his father’s past, but Madame Renauld knows everything. She is a woman of great force of character, and passionately devoted to her husband. They take counsel together. Renauld sees only one way of escape—death. He must appear to die, in reality escaping to another country where he will start again under an assumed name, and where Madame Renauld, having played the widow’s part for a while, can join him. It is essential that she should have control of the money, so he alters his will. How they meant to manage the body business originally, I do not know—possibly an art student’s skeleton—and a fire or something of the kind, but long before their plans have matured an event occurs which plays into"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,3,"their hands. A rough tramp, violent and abusive, finds his way into the garden. There is a struggle, M. Renauld seeks to eject him, and suddenly the tramp, an epileptic, falls down in a fit. He is dead. M. Renauld calls his wife. Together they drag him into the shed—as we know, the event had occurred just outside—and they realize the marvellous opportunity that has been vouchsafed them. The man bears no resemblance to M. Renauld, but he is middle-aged, of a usual French type. That is sufficient. “I rather fancy that they sat on the bench up there, out of earshot from the house, discussing matters. Their plan was quickly made. The identification must rest solely on Madame Renauld’s evidence. Jack Renauld and the chauffeur (who had been with his master two years) must be got out of the way. It was unlikely that the French women servants would go near the body, and in any case Renauld intended to take measures to deceive any one not likely to appreciate details. Masters was sent off, a telegram despatched to Jack, Buenos Ayres being selected to give credence to the story that Renauld had decided upon. Having heard of me, as a rather obscure elderly detective, he wrote his appeal for help knowing that, when I arrived, the production of the letter would have a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,4,"profound effect upon the examining magistrate—which, of course, it did. “They dressed the body of the tramp in a suit of M. Renauld’s and left his ragged coat and trousers by the door of the shed, not daring to take them into the house. And then, to give credence to the tale Madame Renauld was to tell, they drove the aeroplane dagger through his heart. That night, M. Renauld will first bind and gag his wife, and then, taking a spade, will dig a grave in that particular spot of ground where he knows a—how do you call it? bunkair?—is to be made. It is essential that the body should be found—Madame Daubreuil must have no suspicions. On the other hand, if a little time elapses, any dangers as to identity will be greatly lessened. Then, M. Renauld will don the tramp’s rags, and shuffle off to the station, where he will leave, unnoticed, by the 12:10 train. Since the crime will be supposed to have taken place two hours later, no suspicion can possibly attach to him. “You see now his annoyance at the inopportune visit of the girl Bella. Every moment of delay is fatal to his plans. He gets rid of her as soon as he can, however. Then, to work! He leaves the front door slightly ajar to create the impression"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,5,"that the assassins left that way. He binds and gags Madame Renauld, correcting his mistake of twenty-two years ago, when the looseness of the bonds caused suspicion to fall upon his accomplice, but leaving her primed with essentially the same story as he had invented before, proving the unconscious recoil of the mind against originality. The night is chilly, and he slips on an overcoat over his underclothing, intending to cast it into the grave with the dead man. He goes out by the window, smoothing over the flower bed carefully, and thereby furnishing the most positive evidence against himself. He goes out on to the lonely golf links, and he digs—and then—” “Yes?” “And then,” said Poirot gravely, “the justice that he has so long eluded overtakes him. An unknown hand stabs him in the back.… Now, Hastings, you understand what I mean when I talk of _two___ crimes. The first crime, the crime that M. Renauld, in his arrogance, asked us to investigate (ah, but he made a famous mistake there! He misjudged Hercule Poirot!) is solved. But behind it lies a deeper riddle. And to solve that will be difficult—since the criminal in his wisdom, has been content to avail himself of the devices prepared by M. Renauld. It has been a particularly perplexing and baffling mystery to solve. A young"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,6,"hand, like Giraud, who does not place any reliance on the psychology, is almost certain to fail.” “You’re marvellous, Poirot,” I said, with admiration. “Absolutely marvellous. No one on earth but you could have done it!” I think my praise pleased him. For once in his life, he looked almost embarrassed. “Ah, then you no longer despise poor old Papa Poirot? You shift your allegiance back from the human foxhound?” His term for Giraud never failed to make me smile. “Rather. You’ve scored over him handsomely.” “That poor Giraud,” said Poirot, trying unsuccessfully to look modest. “Without doubt it is not all stupidity. He has had _la mauvaise chance___ once or twice. That dark hair coiled round the dagger, for instance. To say the least, it was misleading.” “To tell you the truth, Poirot,” I said slowly, “even now I don’t quite see—whose hair was it?” “Madame Renauld’s of course. That is where _la mauvaise chance___ came in. Her hair, dark originally, is almost completely silvered. It might just as easily have been a grey hair—and then, by no conceivable effort could Giraud have persuaded himself it came from the head of Jack Renauld! But it is all of a piece. Always the facts must be twisted to fit the theory! Did not Giraud find the traces of two persons, a man and a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,7,"woman, in the shed? And how does that fit in with his reconstruction of the case? I will tell you—it does not fit in, and so we shall hear no more of them! I ask you, is that a methodical way of working? The great Giraud! The great Giraud is nothing but a toy balloon—swollen with its own importance. But I, Hercule Poirot, whom he despises, will be the little pin that pricks the big balloon—_comme ça!___” And he made an expressive gesture. Then, calming down, he resumed: “Without doubt, when Madame Renauld recovers, she will speak. The possibility of her son being accused of the murder never occurred to her. How should it, when she believed him safely at sea on board the _Anzora?___ _Ah! voilà une femme___, Hastings! What force, what self-command! She only made one slip. On his unexpected return: ‘It does not matter—_now___.’ And no one noticed—no one realized the significance of those words. What a terrible part she has had to play, poor woman. Imagine the shock when she goes to identify the body and, instead of what she expects, sees the actual lifeless form of the husband she has believed miles away by now. No wonder she fainted! But since then, despite her grief and her despair, how resolutely she has played her part, and how the anguish"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,8,"of it must wring her. She cannot say a word to set us on the track of the real murderers. For her son’s sake, no one must know that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau, the criminal. Final and most bitter blow, she has admitted publicly that Madame Daubreuil was her husband’s mistress—for a hint of blackmail might be fatal to her secret. How cleverly she dealt with the examining magistrate when he asked her if there was any mystery in her husband’s past life. ‘Nothing so romantic, I am sure, M. le juge.’ It was perfect, the indulgent tone, the _soupçon___ of sad mockery. At once M. Hautet felt himself foolish and melodramatic. Yes, she is a great woman! If she loved a criminal, she loved him royally!” Poirot lost himself in contemplation. “One thing more, Poirot, what about the piece of lead piping?” “You do not see? To disfigure the victim’s face so that it would be unrecognizable. It was that which first set me on the right track. And that imbecile of a Giraud, swarming all over it to look for match ends! Did I not tell you that a clue of two feet long was quite as good as a clue of two inches?” “Well, Giraud will sing small now,” I observed hastily, to lead the conversation away from my own"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,9,"shortcomings. “As I said before, will he? If he has arrived at the right person by the wrong method, he will not permit that to worry him.” “But surely—” I paused as I saw the new trend of things. “You see, Hastings, we must now start again. Who killed M. Renauld? Some one who was near the Villa just before twelve o’clock that night, some one who would benefit by his death—the description fits Jack Renauld only too well. The crime need not have been premeditated. And then the dagger!” I started, I had not realized that point. “Of course,” I said. “The second dagger we found in the tramp was Mrs. Renauld’s. There _were___ two, then.” “Certainly, and, since they were duplicates, it stands to reason that Jack Renauld was the owner. But that would not trouble me so much. In fact I have a little idea as to that. No, the worst indictment against him is again psychological—heredity, _mon ami___, heredity! Like father, like son—Jack Renauld, when all is said or done, is the son of Georges Conneau.” His tone was grave and earnest, and I was impressed in spite of myself. “What is your little idea that you mentioned just now?” I asked. For answer, Poirot consulted his turnip-faced watch, and then asked: “What time is the afternoon boat from Calais?”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,21,21 Hercule Poirot on the Case!,10,"“About five, I believe.” “That will do very well. We shall just have time.” “You are going to England?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why?” “To find a possible—witness.” “Who?” With a rather peculiar smile upon his face, Poirot replied: “Miss Bella Duveen.” “But how will you find her—what do you know about her?” “I know nothing about her—but I can guess a good deal. We may take it for granted that her name _is___ Bella Duveen, and since that name was faintly familiar to M. Stonor, though evidently not in connection with the Renauld family, it is probable that she is on the stage. Jack Renauld was a young man with plenty of money, and twenty years of age. The stage is sure to have been the home of his first love. It tallies, too, with M. Renauld’s attempt to placate her with a cheque. I think I shall find her all right—especially with the help of _this___.” And he brought out the photograph I had seen him take from Jack Renauld’s drawer. “With love from Bella,” was scrawled across the corner, but it was not that which held my eyes fascinated. The likeness was not first rate—but for all that it was unmistakable to me. I felt a cold sinking, as though some unutterable calamity had befallen me. It was the face of Cinderella."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,1,"For a moment or two I sat as though frozen, the photograph still in my hand. Then, summoning all my courage to appear unmoved, I handed it back. At the same time, I stole a quick glance at Poirot. Had he noticed anything? But to my relief he did not seem to be observing me. Anything unusual in my manner had certainly escaped him. He rose briskly to his feet. “We have no time to lose. We must make our departure with all despatch. All is well—the sea it will be calm!” In the bustle of departure, I had no time for thinking, but once on board the boat, secure from Poirot’s observation (he, as usual, was “practising the method most excellent of Laverguier”) I pulled myself together, and attacked the facts dispassionately. How much did Poirot know? Was he aware that my acquaintance of the train and Bella Duveen were one and the same? Why had he gone to the Hôtel du Phare? On my behalf as I had believed? Or had I only fatuously thought so, and was this visit undertaken with a deeper and more sinister purpose? But in any case, why was he bent on finding this girl? Did he suspect her of having seen Jack Renauld commit the crime? Or did he suspect—but that was impossible! The girl had no grudge against the elder Renauld, no possible motive for wishing his death. What had brought her back to the scene of the murder? I went over the facts carefully. She must have left the train at Calais where I parted from her that day. No wonder I had been unable to find her on the boat. If she had dined in Calais, and then taken a train"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,2,"out to Merlinville, she would have arrived at the Villa Geneviève just about the time that Françoise said. What had she done when she left the house just after ten? Presumably either gone to an hotel, or returned to Calais. And then? The crime had been committed on Tuesday night. On Thursday morning, she was once more in Merlinville. Had she ever left France at all? I doubted it very much. What kept her there—the hope of seeing Jack Renauld? I had told her (as at the time we believed) that he was on the high seas _en route___ to Buenos Ayres. Possibly she was aware that the _Anzora___ had not sailed. But to know that she must have seen Jack. Was that what Poirot was after? Had Jack Renauld, returning to see Marthe Daubreuil, come face to face instead with Bella Duveen, the girl he had heartlessly thrown over? I began to see daylight. If that were indeed the case, it might furnish Jack with the alibi he needed. Yet under those circumstances his silence seemed difficult to explain. Why could he not have spoken out boldly? Did he fear for this former entanglement of his to come to the ears of Marthe Daubreuil? I shook my head, dissatisfied. The thing had been harmless enough, a foolish boy and girl affair, and I reflected cynically that the son of a millionaire was not likely to be thrown over by a penniless French girl, who moreover loved him devotedly, without a much graver cause. Altogether I found the affair puzzling and unsatisfactory. I disliked intensely being associated with Poirot in hunting this girl down, but I could not see any way of avoiding it, without revealing everything to him, and this, for"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,3,"some reason, I was loath to do. Poirot reappeared brisk and smiling at Dover, and our journey to London was uneventful. It was past nine o’clock when we arrived, and I supposed that we should return straight away to our rooms and do nothing till the morning. But Poirot had other plans. “We must lose no time, _mon ami___. The news of the arrest will not be in the English papers until the day after tomorrow, but still we must lose no time.” I did not quite follow his reasoning, but I merely asked how he proposed to find the girl. “You remember Joseph Aarons, the theatrical agent? No? I assisted him in a little matter of a Japanese wrestler. A pretty little problem, I must recount it to you one day. He, without doubt, will be able to put us in the way of finding out what we want to know.” It took us some time to run Mr. Aarons to earth, and it was after midnight when we finally managed it. He greeted Poirot with every evidence of warmth, and professed himself ready to be of service to us in any way. “There’s not much about the profession I don’t know,” he said, beaming genially. “_Eh bien___, M. Aarons, I desire to find a young girl called Bella Duveen.” “Bella Duveen. I know the name, but for the moment I can’t place it. What’s her line?” “That I do not know—but here is her photograph.” Mr. Aarons studied it for a moment, then his face lighted. “Got it!” He slapped his thigh. “The Dulcibella Kids, by the Lord!” “The Dulcibella Kids?” “That’s it. They’re sisters. Acrobats, dancers and singers. Give quite a good little turn. They’re in the provinces somewhere,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,4,"I believe—if they’re not resting. They’ve been on in Paris for the last two or three weeks.” “Can you find out for me exactly where they are?” “Easy as a bird. You go home, and I’ll send you round the dope in the morning.” With this promise we took leave of him. He was as good as his word. About eleven o’clock the following day, a scribbled note reached us. “The Dulcibella Sisters are on at the Palace in Coventry. Good luck to you.” Without more ado, we started for Coventry. Poirot made no inquiries at the theatre, but contented himself with booking stalls for the variety performance that evening. The show was wearisome beyond words—or perhaps it was only my mood that made it seem so. Japanese families balanced themselves precariously, would-be fashionable men, in greenish evening dress and exquisitely slicked hair, reeled off society patter and danced marvellously, stout prima donnas sang at the top of the human register, a comic comedian endeavoured to be Mr. George Robey and failed signally. At last the number went up which announced the Dulcibella Kids. My heart beat sickeningly. There she was—there they both were, the pair of them, one flaxen haired, one dark, matching as to size, with short fluffy skirts and immense buster brown bows. They looked a pair of extremely piquant children. They began to sing. Their voices were fresh and true, rather thin and music-hally, but attractive. It was quite a pretty little turn. They danced neatly, and did some clever little acrobatic feats. The words of their songs were crisp and catchy. When the curtain fell, there was a full meed of applause. Evidently the Dulcibella Kids were a success. Suddenly I felt that I could remain no"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,5,"longer. I must get out into the air. I suggested leaving to Poirot. “Go by all means, _mon ami___. I amuse myself, and will stay to the end. I will rejoin you later.” It was only a few steps from the theatre to the hotel. I went up to the sitting-room, ordered a whisky and soda, and sat drinking it, staring meditatively into the empty grate. I heard the door open, and turned my head, thinking it was Poirot. Then I jumped to my feet. It was Cinderella who stood in the doorway. She spoke haltingly, her breath coming in little gasps. “I saw you in front. You and your friend. When you got up to go, I was waiting outside and followed you. Why are you here—in Coventry? What were you doing there to-night? Is the man who was with you the—the detective?” She stood there, the cloak she had wrapped round her stage dress slipping from her shoulders. I saw the whiteness of her cheeks under the rouge, and heard the terror in her voice. And in that moment I understood everything—understood why Poirot was seeking her, and what she feared, and understood at last my own heart.… “Yes,” I said gently. “Is he looking for—me?” she half whispered. Then, as I did not answer for a moment, she slipped down by the big chair, and burst into violent, bitter weeping. I knelt down by her, holding her in my arms, and smoothing the hair back from her face. “Don’t cry, child, don’t cry, for God’s sake. You’re safe here. I’ll take care of you. Don’t cry, darling. Don’t cry. I know—I know everything.” “Oh, but you don’t!” “I think I do.” And after a moment, as her sobs grew"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,6,"quieter, I asked: “It was you who took the dagger, wasn’t it?” “Yes.” “That was why you wanted me to show you round? And why you pretended to faint?” Again she nodded. It was a strange thought to come to me at the moment, but it shot into my mind that I was glad her motive was what it had been—rather than the idle and morbid curiosity I had accused her of at the time. How gallantly she had played her part that day, inwardly racked with fear and trepidation as she must have been. Poor little soul, bearing the burden of a moment’s impetuous action. “Why did you take the dagger?” I asked presently. She replied as simply as a child: “I was afraid there might be finger-marks on it.” “But didn’t you remember that you had worn gloves?” She shook her head as though bewildered, and then said slowly: “Are you going to give me up to—to the Police?” “Good God! no.” Her eyes sought mine long and earnestly, and then she asked in a little quiet voice that sounded afraid of itself: “Why not?” It seemed a strange place and a strange time for a declaration of love—and God knows, in all my imagining, I had never pictured love coming to me in such a guise. But I answered simply and naturally enough: “Because I love you, Cinderella.” She bent her head down, as though ashamed, and muttered in a broken voice: “You can’t—you can’t—not if you knew—” And then, as though rallying herself, she faced me squarely, and asked: “What do you know, then?” “I know that you came to see Mr. Renauld that night. He offered you a cheque and you tore it up indignantly. Then you"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,7,"left the house—” I paused. “Go on—what next?” “I don’t know whether you knew that Jack Renauld would be coming that night, or whether you just waited about on the chance of seeing him, but you did wait about. Perhaps you were just miserable, and walked aimlessly—but at any rate just before twelve you were still near there, and you saw a man on the golf links—” Again I paused. I had leapt to the truth in a flash as she entered the room, but now the picture rose before me even more convincingly. I saw vividly the peculiar pattern of the overcoat on the dead body of Mr. Renauld, and I remembered the amazing likeness that had startled me into believing for one instant that the dead man had risen from the dead when his son burst into our conclave in the _salon___. “Go on,” repeated the girl steadily. “I fancy his back was to you—but you recognized him, or thought you recognized him. The gait and the carriage were familiar to you, and the pattern of his overcoat.” I paused. “You told me in the train on the way from Paris that you had Italian blood in your veins, and that you had nearly got into trouble once with it. You used a threat in one of your letters to Jack Renauld. When you saw him there, your anger and jealousy drove you mad—and you struck! I don’t believe for a minute that you meant to kill him. But you did kill him, Cinderella.” She had flung up her hands to cover her face, and in a choked voice she said: “You’re right… you’re right… I can see it all as you tell it.” Then she turned on me almost"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,8,"savagely. “And you love me? Knowing what you do, how can you love me?” “I don’t know,” I said a little wearily. “I think love is like that—a thing one cannot help. I have tried, I know—ever since the first day I met you. And love has been too strong for me.” And then suddenly, when I least expected it, she broke down again, casting herself down on the floor and sobbing wildly. “Oh, I can’t!” she cried. “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which way to turn. Oh, pity me, pity me, some one, and tell me what to do!” Again I knelt by her, soothing her as best I could. “Don’t be afraid of me, Bella. For God’s sake don’t be afraid of me. I love you, that’s true—but I don’t want anything in return. Only let me help you. Love him still if you have to, but let me help you as he can’t.” It was as though she had been turned to stone by my words. She raised her head from her hands and stared at me. “You think that?” she whispered. “You think that I love Jack Renauld?” Then, half laughing, half crying, she flung her arms passionately round my neck, and pressed her sweet wet face to mine. “Not as I love you,” she whispered. “Never as I love you!” Her lips brushed my cheek, and then, seeking my mouth, kissed me again and again with a sweetness and fire beyond belief. The wildness of it—and the wonder, I shall not forget—no, not as long as I live! It was a sound in the doorway that made us look up. Poirot was standing there looking at us. I did not hesitate. With"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,9,"a bound I reached him and pinioned his arms to his sides. “Quick,” I said to the girl. “Get out of here. As fast as you can. I’ll hold him.” With one look at me, she fled out of the room past us. I held Poirot in a grip of iron. “_Mon ami___,” observed the latter mildly, “you do this sort of thing very well. The strong man holds me in his grasp and I am helpless as a child. But all this is uncomfortable and slightly ridiculous. Let us sit down and be calm.” “You won’t pursue her?” “_Mon Dieu!___ no. Am I Giraud? Release me, my friend.” Keeping a suspicious eye upon him, for I paid Poirot the compliment of knowing that I was no match for him in astuteness, I relaxed my grip, and he sank into an arm-chair, feeling his arms tenderly. “It is that you have the strength of a bull when you are roused, Hastings! _Eh bien___, and do you think you have behaved well to your old friend? I show you the girl’s photograph and you recognize it, but you never say a word.” “There was no need if you knew that I recognized it,” I said rather bitterly. So Poirot had known all along! I had not deceived him for an instant. “Ta-ta! You did not know that I knew that. And tonight you help the girl to escape when we have found her with so much trouble! _Eh bien!___ it comes to this—are you going to work with me or against me, Hastings?” For a moment or two I did not answer. To break with my old friend gave me great pain. Yet I must definitely range myself against him. Would he"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,22,22 I Find Love,10,"ever forgive me, I wondered? He had been strangely calm so far, but I knew him to possess marvellous self-command. “Poirot,” I said, “I’m sorry. I admit I’ve behaved badly to you over this. But sometimes one has no choice. And in future I must take my own line.” Poirot nodded his head several times. “I understand,” he said. The mocking light had quite died out of his eyes, and he spoke with a sincerity and kindness that surprised me. “It is that, my friend, is it not? It is love that has come—not as you imagined it, all cock a hoop with fine feathers, but sadly, with bleeding feet. Well, well—I warned you. When I realized that this girl must have taken the dagger, I warned you. Perhaps you remember. But already it was too late. But, tell me, how much do you know?” I met his eyes squarely. “Nothing that you could tell me would be any surprise to me, Poirot. Understand that. But in case you think of resuming your search for Miss Duveen, I should like you to know one thing clearly. If you have any idea that she was concerned in the crime, or was the mysterious lady who called upon Mr. Renauld that night, you are wrong. I travelled home from France with her that day, and parted from her at Victoria that evening so that it is clearly impossible for her to have been in Merlinville.” “Ah!” Poirot looked at me thoughtfully. “And you would swear to that in a court of law?” “Most certainly I would.” Poirot rose and bowed. “_Mon ami! Vive l’amour!___ It can perform miracles. It is decidedly ingenious what you have thought of there. It defeats even Hercule Poirot!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,1,"After a moment of stress, such as I have just described, reaction is bound to set in. I retired to rest that night on a note of triumph, but I awoke to realize that I was by no means out of the wood. True, I could see no flaw in the alibi I had so suddenly conceived. I had but to stick to my story, and I failed to see how Bella could be convicted in face of it. It was not as though there was any old friendship between us that could be raked up, and which might lead them to suspect that I was committing perjury. It could be proved that in actual fact I had only seen the girl on three occasions. No, I was still satisfied with my idea—had not even Poirot admitted that it defeated him? But there I felt the need of treading warily. All very well for my little friend to admit himself momentarily nonplussed. I had far too much respect for his abilities to conceive of him as being content to remain in that position. I had a very humble opinion of my wits when it came to matching them against his. Poirot would not take defeat lying down. Somehow or other, he would endeavour to turn the tables on me, and that in the way, and at the moment, when I least expected it. We met at breakfast the following morning as though nothing had happened. Poirot’s good temper was imperturbable, yet I thought I detected a film of reserve in his manner which was new. After breakfast, I announced my intention of going out for a stroll. A malicious gleam shot through Poirot’s eyes. “If it is information you seek, you need not be at the pains of deranging yourself. I can tell you all you wish to know. The Dulcibella Sisters have cancelled their contract, and have left Coventry for an unknown destination.” “Is that really so, Poirot?” “You can take it from me, Hastings. I made inquiries the first thing this morning. After all, what else did you expect?” True enough, nothing else could be expected under the circumstances. Cinderella had profited by the slight"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,2,"start I had been able to assure her, and would certainly not lose a moment in removing herself from the reach of the pursuer. It was what I had intended and planned. Nevertheless, I was aware of being plunged into a network of fresh difficulties. I had absolutely no means of communicating with the girl, and it was vital that she should know the line of defence that had occurred to me, and which I was prepared to carry out. Of course it was possible that she might try to send word to me in some way or another, but I hardly thought it likely. She would know the risk she ran of a message being intercepted by Poirot, thus setting him on her track once more. Clearly her only course was to disappear utterly for the time being. But, in the meantime, what was Poirot doing? I studied him attentively. He was wearing his most innocent air, and staring meditatively into the far distance. He looked altogether too placid and supine to give me reassurance. I had learned, with Poirot, that the less dangerous he looked, the more dangerous he was. His quiescence alarmed me. Observing a troubled quality in my glance, he smiled benignantly. “You are puzzled, Hastings? You ask yourself why I do not launch myself in pursuit?” “Well—something of the kind.” “It is what you would do, were you in my place. I understand that. But I am not of those who enjoy rushing up and down a country seeking a needle in a haystack, as you English say. No—let Mademoiselle Bella Duveen go. Without doubt, I shall be able to find her when the time comes. Until then, I am content to wait.” I stared at him doubtfully. Was he seeking to mislead me? I had an irritating feeling that, even now, he was master of the situation. My sense of superiority was gradually waning. I had contrived the girl’s escape, and evolved a brilliant scheme for saving her from the consequences of her rash act—but I could not rest easy in my mind. Poirot’s perfect calm awakened a thousand apprehensions. “I suppose, Poirot,” I said rather diffidently, “I mustn’t ask what"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,3,"your plans are? I’ve forfeited the right.” “But not at all. There is no secret about them. We return to France without delay.” “_We?___” “Precisely—‘_we!___’ You know very well that you cannot afford to let Papa Poirot out of your sight. Eh, is it not so, my friend? But remain in England by all means if you wish—” I shook my head. He had hit the nail on the head. I could not afford to let him out of my sight. Although I could not expect his confidence after what had happened, I could still check his actions. The only danger to Bella lay with him. Giraud and the French police were indifferent to her existence. At all costs I must keep near Poirot. Poirot observed me attentively as these reflections passed through my mind, and gave a nod of satisfaction. “I am right, am I not? And as you are quite capable of trying to follow me, disguised with some absurdity such as a false beard—which every one would perceive, _bien entendu___—I much prefer that we should voyage together. It would annoy me greatly that any one should mock themselves at you.” “Very well, then. But it’s only fair to warn you—” “I know—I know all. You are my enemy! Be my enemy then. It does not worry me at all.” “So long as it’s all fair and above-board, I don’t mind.” “You have to the full the English passion for ‘fair-play!’ Now your scruples are satisfied, let us depart immediately. There is no time to be lost. Our stay in England has been short but sufficient. I know—what I wanted to know.” The tone was light, but I read a veiled menace into the words. “Still—” I began, and stopped. “Still—as you say! Without doubt you are satisfied with the part you are playing. Me, I preoccupy myself with Jack Renauld.” Jack Renauld! The words gave me a start. I had completely forgotten that aspect of the case. Jack Renauld, in prison, with the shadow of the guillotine looming over him! I saw the part I was playing in a more sinister light. I could save Bella—yes, but in doing so I ran the risk"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,4,"of sending an innocent man to his death. I pushed the thought from me with horror. It could not be. He would be acquitted. Certainly he would be acquitted! But the cold fear came back. Suppose he were not? What then? Could I have it on my conscience—horrible thought! Would it come to that in the end? A decision. Bella or Jack Renauld? The promptings of my heart were to save the girl I loved at any cost to myself. But, if the cost were to another, the problem was altered. What would the girl herself say? I remembered that no word of Jack Renauld’s arrest had passed my lips. As yet she was in total ignorance of the fact that her former lover was in prison charged with a hideous crime which he had not committed. When she knew, how would she act? Would she permit her life to be saved at the expense of his? Certainly she must do nothing rash. Jack Renauld might, and probably would, be acquitted without any intervention on her part. If so, good. But if he was not.… That was the terrible, the unanswerable problem. I fancied that she ran no risk of the extreme penalty. The circumstances of the crime were quite different in her case. She could plead jealousy and extreme provocation, and her youth and beauty would go for much. The fact that by a tragic mistake it was old Mr. Renauld, and not his son, who paid the penalty would not alter the motive of the crime. But in any case, however lenient the sentence of the Court, it must mean a long term of imprisonment. No, Bella must be protected. And, at the same time, Jack Renauld must be saved. How this was to be accomplished I did not see clearly. But I pinned my faith to Poirot. He knew. Come what might, he would manage to save an innocent man. He must find some pretext other than the real one. It might be difficult, but he would manage it somehow. And with Bella unsuspected, and Jack Renauld acquitted, all would end satisfactorily. So I told myself repeatedly, but at the bottom of my heart"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,5,"there still remained a cold fear. 24 “Save Him!” We crossed from England by the evening boat, and the following morning saw us in Saint-Omer, whither Jack Renauld had been taken. Poirot lost no time in visiting M. Hautet. As he did not seem disposed to make any objections to my accompanying him, I bore him company. After various formalities and preliminaries, we were conducted to the examining magistrate’s room. He greeted us cordially. “I was told that you had returned to England, M. Poirot. I am glad to find that such is not the case.” “It is true that I went there, M. le juge, but it was only for a flying visit. A side issue, but one that I fancied might repay investigation.” “And it did—eh?” Poirot shrugged his shoulders. M. Hautet nodded, sighing. “We must resign ourselves, I fear. That animal Giraud, his manners are abominable, but he is undoubtedly clever! Not much chance of that one making a mistake.” “You think not, M. le juge?” It was the examining magistrate’s turn to shrug his shoulders. “_Eh bien___, speaking frankly—in confidence, _c’est entendu___—can you come to any other conclusion?” “Frankly, M. le juge, there seem to me to be many points that are obscure.” “Such as—?” But Poirot was not to be drawn. “I have not yet tabulated them,” he remarked. “It was a general reflection that I was making. I liked the young man, and should be sorry to believe him guilty of such a hideous crime. By the way, what has he to say for himself on the matter?” The magistrate frowned. “I cannot understand him. He seems incapable of putting up any sort of defence. It has been most difficult to get him to answer questions. He contents himself with a general denial, and beyond that takes refuge in a most obstinate silence. I am interrogating him again tomorrow; perhaps you would like to be present?” We accepted the invitation with _empressement___. “A distressing case,” said the magistrate with a sigh. “My sympathy for Madame Renauld is profound.” “How is Madame Renauld?” “She has not yet recovered consciousness. It is merciful in a way, poor woman, she is being spared much."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,6,"The doctors say that there is no danger, but that when she comes to herself she must be kept as quiet as possible. It was, I understand, quite as much the shock as the fall which caused her present state. It would be terrible if her brain became unhinged; but I should not wonder at all—no, really, not at all.” M. Hautet leaned back, shaking his head, with a sort of mournful enjoyment, as he envisaged the gloomy prospect. He roused himself at length, and observed with a start. “That reminds me. I have here a letter for you, M. Poirot. Let me see, where did I put it?” He proceeded to rummage amongst his papers. At last he found the missive, and handed it to Poirot. “It was sent under cover to me in order that I might forward it to you,” he explained. “But as you left no address I could not do so.” Poirot studied the letter curiously. It was addressed in a long, sloping, foreign hand, and the writing was decidedly a woman’s. Poirot did not open it. Instead he put it in his pocket and rose to his feet. “_A demain___ then, M. le juge. Many thanks for your courtesy and amiability.” “But not at all. I am always at your service. These young detectives of the school of Giraud, they are all alike—rude, sneering fellows. They do not realize that an examining magistrate of my—er—experience is bound to have a certain discernment, a certain—_flair___. _Enfin!___ the politeness of the old school is infinitely more to my taste. Therefore, my dear friend, command me in any way you will. We know a thing or two, you and I—eh?” And laughing heartily, enchanted with himself and with us, M. Hautet bade us adieu. I am sorry to have to record that Poirot’s first remark to me as we traversed the corridor was: “A famous old imbecile, that one! Of a stupidity to make pity!” We were just leaving the building when we came face to face with Giraud, looking more dandified than ever, and thoroughly pleased with himself. “Aha! M. Poirot,” he cried airily. “You have returned from England then?” “As you"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,7,"see,” said Poirot. “The end of the case is not far off now, I fancy.” “I agree with you, M. Giraud.” Poirot spoke in a subdued tone. His crest-fallen manner seemed to delight the other. “Of all the milk and water criminals! Not an idea of defending himself. It is extraordinary!” “So extraordinary that it gives one to think, does it not?” suggested Poirot mildly. But Giraud was not even listening. He twirled his cane amicably. “Well, good day, M. Poirot. I am glad you’re satisfied of young Renauld’s guilt at last.” “_Pardon!___ But I am not in the least satisfied. Jack Renauld is innocent.” Giraud stared for a moment—then burst out laughing, tapping his head significantly with the brief remark: “_Toqué!___” Poirot drew himself up. A dangerous light showed in his eyes. “M. Giraud, throughout the case your manner to me has been deliberately insulting! You need teaching a lesson. I am prepared to wager you 500 francs that I find the murderer of M. Renauld before you do. Is it agreed?” Giraud stared helplessly at him, and murmured again: “_Toqué!___” “Come now,” urged Poirot, “is it agreed?” “I have no wish to take your money from you.” “Make your mind easy—you will not!” “Oh, well then, I agree! You speak of my manner to you being insulting. _Eh bien___, once or twice, _your___ manner has annoyed _me___.” “I am enchanted to hear it,” said Poirot. “Good morning, M. Giraud. Come, Hastings.” I said no word as we walked along the street. My heart was heavy. Poirot had displayed his intentions only too plainly. I doubted more than ever my powers of saving Bella from the consequences of her act. This unlucky encounter with Giraud had roused Poirot and put him on his mettle. Suddenly I felt a hand laid on my shoulder, and turned to face Gabriel Stonor. We stopped and greeted him, and he proposed strolling with us back to our hotel. “And what are you doing here, M. Stonor?” inquired Poirot. “One must stand by one’s friends,” replied the other dryly. “Especially when they are unjustly accused.” “Then you do not believe that Jack Renauld committed the crime?” I asked eagerly. “Certainly"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,8,"I don’t. I know the lad. I admit that there have been one or two things in this business that have staggered me completely, but none the less, in spite of his fool way of taking it, I’ll never believe that Jack Renauld is a murderer.” My heart warmed to the secretary. His words seemed to lift a secret weight from my heart. “I have no doubt that many people feel as you do,” I exclaimed. “There is really absurdly little evidence against him. I should say that there was no doubt of his acquittal—no doubt whatever.” But Stonor hardly responded as I could have wished. “I’d give a lot to think as you do,” he said gravely. He turned to Poirot. “What’s your opinion, monsieur?” “I think that things look very black against him,” said Poirot quietly. “You believe him guilty?” said Stonor sharply. “No. But I think he will find it hard to prove his innocence.” “He’s behaving so damned queerly,” muttered Stonor. “Of course I realize that there’s a lot more in this affair than meets the eye. Giraud’s not wise to that because he’s an outsider, but the whole thing has been damned odd. As to that, least said soonest mended. If Mrs. Renauld wants to hush anything up, I’ll take my cue from her. It’s her show, and I’ve too much respect for her judgment to shove my oar in, but I can’t get behind this attitude of Jack’s. Any one would think he _wanted___ to be thought guilty.” “But it’s absurd,” I cried, bursting in. “For one thing, the dagger—” I paused, uncertain as to how much Poirot would wish me to reveal. I continued, choosing my words carefully, “We know that the dagger could not have been in Jack Renauld’s possession that evening. Mrs. Renauld knows that.” “True,” said Stonor. “When she recovers, she will doubtless say all this and more. Well, I must be leaving you.” “One moment.” Poirot’s hand arrested his departure. “Can you arrange for word to be sent to me at once should Madame Renauld recover consciousness?” “Certainly. That’s easily done.” “That point about the dagger is good, Poirot,” I urged as we went upstairs."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,9,"“I couldn’t speak very plainly before Stonor.” “That was quite right of you. We might as well keep the knowledge to ourselves as long as we can. As to the dagger, your point hardly helps Jack Renauld. You remember that I was absent for an hour this morning, before we started from London?” “Yes?” “Well, I was employed in trying to find the firm Jack Renauld employed to convert his souvenirs. It was not very difficult. _Eh bien___, Hastings, they made to his order not _two___ paper-knives, but _three___.” “So that—?” “So that, after giving one to his mother, and one to Bella Duveen, there was a third which he doubtless retained for his own use. No, Hastings, I fear the dagger question will not help us to save him from the guillotine.” “It won’t come to that,” I cried, stung. Poirot shook his head uncertainly. “You will save him,” I cried positively. Poirot glanced at me dryly. “Have you not rendered it impossible, _mon ami?___” “Some other way,” I muttered. “Ah! _Sapristi!___ But it is miracles you ask from me. No—say no more. Let us instead see what is in this letter.” And he drew out the envelope from his breast pocket. His face contracted as he read, then he handed the one flimsy sheet to me. “There are other women in the world who suffer, Hastings.” The writing was blurred and the note had evidently been written in great agitation: “_Dear M. Poirot:___ “If you get this, I beg of you to come to my aid. I have no one to turn to, and at all costs Jack must be saved. I implore of you on my knees to help us. “MARTHE DAUBREUIL.” I handed it back, moved. “You will go?” “At once. We will command an auto.” Half an hour later saw us at the Villa Marguerite. Marthe was at the door to meet us, and led Poirot in, clinging with both hands to one of his. “Ah, you have come—it is good of you. I have been in despair, not knowing what to do. They will not let me go to see him in prison even. I suffer horribly, I am nearly"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,23,23 Difficulties Ahead,10,"mad. Is it true what they say, that he does not deny the crime? But that is madness. It is impossible that he should have done it! Never for one minute will I believe it.” “Neither do I believe it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot gently. “But then why does he not speak? I do not understand.” “Perhaps because he is screening some one,” suggested Poirot, watching her. Marthe frowned. “Screening some one? Do you mean his mother? Ah, from the beginning I have suspected her. Who inherits all that vast fortune? She does. It is easy to wear widow’s weeds and play the hypocrite. And they say that when he was arrested she fell down—like _that___.” She made a dramatic gesture. “And without doubt, M. Stonor, the secretary, he helped her. They are thick as thieves, those two. It is true she is older than he—but what do men care—if a woman is rich!” There was a hint of bitterness in her tone. “Stonor was in England,” I put in. “He says so—but who knows?” “Mademoiselle,” said Poirot quietly, “if we are to work together, you and I, we must have things clear. First, I will ask you a question.” “Yes, monsieur?” “Are you aware of your mother’s real name?” Marthe looked at him for a minute, then, letting her head fall forward on her arms, she burst into tears. “There, there,” said Poirot, patting her on the shoulder. “Calm yourself, _petite___, I see that you know. Now a second question, did you know who M. Renauld was?” “M. Renauld,” she raised her head from her hands and gazed at him wonderingly. “Ah, I see you do not know that. Now listen to me carefully.” Step by step, he went over the case, much as he had done to me on the day of our departure for England. Marthe listened spellbound. When he had finished, she drew a long breath. “But you are wonderful—magnificent! You are the greatest detective in the world.” With a swift gesture she slipped off her chair and knelt before him with an abandonment that was wholly French. “Save him, monsieur,” she cried. “I love him so. Oh, save him, save him—save him!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,1,"We were present the following morning at the examination of Jack Renauld. Short as the time had been, I was shocked at the change that had taken place in the young prisoner. His cheeks had fallen in, there were deep black circles round his eyes, and he looked haggard and distraught, as one who had wooed sleep in vain for several nights. He betrayed no emotion at seeing us. The prisoner and his counsel, Maître Grosíer, were accommodated with chairs. A formidable guard with resplendent sabre stood before the door. The patient _greffier___ sat at his desk. The examination began. “Renauld,” began the magistrate, “do you deny that you were in Merlinville on the night of the crime?”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,2,"Jack did not reply at once, then he said with a hesitancy of manner which was piteous: “I—I—told you that I was in Cherbourg.” Maître Grosíer frowned and sighed. I realized at once that Jack Renauld was obstinately bent on conducting his own case as he wished, to the despair of his legal representative. The magistrate turned sharply. “Send in the station witnesses.” In a moment or two the door opened to admit a man whom I recognized as being a porter at Merlinville station. “You were on duty on the night of June 7th?” “Yes, monsieur.” “You witnessed the arrival of the 11:40 train?” “Yes, monsieur.” “Look at the prisoner. Do you recognize him as having"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,3,"been one of the passengers to alight?” “Yes, Monsieur le juge.” “There is no possibility of your being mistaken?” “No, monsieur. I knew M. Jack Renauld well.” “Nor of your being mistaken as to the date?” “No, monsieur. Because it was the following morning, June 8th, that we heard of the murder.” Another railway official was brought in, and confirmed the first one’s evidence. The magistrate looked at Jack Renauld. “These men have identified you positively. What have you to say?” Jack shrugged his shoulders. “Nothing.” M. Hautet exchanged a glance with the _greffier___, as the scratching of the latter’s pen recorded the answer. “Renauld,” continued the magistrate, “do you recognize this?” He took something from the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,4,"table by his side, and held it out to the prisoner. I shuddered as I recognized the aeroplane dagger. “Pardon,” cried Maître Grosíer. “I demand to speak to my client before he answers that question.” But Jack Renauld had no consideration for the feelings of the wretched Grosíer. He waved him aside, and replied quietly: “Certainly I recognize it. It is a present given by me to my mother, as a souvenir of the War.” “Is there, as far as you know, any duplicate of that dagger in existence?” Again Maître Grosíer burst out, and again Jack overrode him. “Not that I know of. The setting was my own design.” Even the magistrate almost gasped at the"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,5,"boldness of the reply. It did, in very truth, seem as though Jack was rushing on his fate. I realized, of course, the vital necessity he was under of concealing, for Bella’s sake, the fact that there was a duplicate dagger in the case. So long as there was supposed to be only one weapon, no suspicion was likely to attach to the girl who had had the second paper-knife in her possession. He was valiantly shielding the woman he had once loved—but at what a cost to himself! I began to realize the magnitude of the task I had so lightly set Poirot. It would not be easy to secure the acquittal of Jack Renauld, by"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,6,"anything short of the truth. M. Hautet spoke again, with a peculiarly biting inflection: “Madame Renauld told us that this dagger was on her dressing table on the night of the crime. But Madame Renauld is a mother! It will doubtless astonish you, Renauld, but I consider it highly likely that Madame Renauld was mistaken, and that, by inadvertence perhaps, you had taken it with you to Paris. Doubtless you will contradict me—” I saw the lad’s handcuffed hands clench themselves. The perspiration stood out in beads upon his brow, as with a supreme effort he interrupted M. Hautet in a hoarse voice: “I shall not contradict you. It is possible.” It was a stupefying moment. Maître"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,7,"Grosíer rose to his feet, protesting: “My client has undergone a considerable nervous strain. I should wish it put on record that I do not consider him answerable for what he says.” The magistrate quelled him angrily. For a moment a doubt seemed to arise in his own mind. Jack Renauld had almost overdone his part. He leaned forward, and gazed at the prisoner searchingly. “Do you fully understand, Renauld, that on the answers you have given me I shall have no alternative but to commit you for trial?” Jack’s pale face flushed. He looked steadily back. “M. Hautet, I swear that I did not kill my father.” But the magistrate’s brief moment of doubt was over."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,8,"He laughed a short, unpleasant laugh. “Without doubt, without doubt—they are always innocent, our prisoners! By your own mouth you are condemned. You can offer no defence, no alibi—only a mere assertion which would not deceive a babe!—that you are not guilty. You killed your father, Renauld—cruel and cowardly murder—for the sake of money which you believed would come to you at his death. Your mother was an accessory after the fact. Doubtless, in view of the fact that she acted as a mother, the courts will extend an indulgence to her that they will not accord to you. And rightly so! Your crime was a horrible one—to be held in abhorrence by gods and men!” M."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,9,"Hautet was enjoying himself, working up his period, steeped in the solemnity of the moment, and his own role as representative of justice. “You killed—and you must pay the consequences of your action. I speak to you, not as a man, but as Justice, eternal Justice, which—” M. Hautet was interrupted—to his intense annoyance. The door was pushed open. “M. le juge, M. le juge,” stammered the attendant, “there is a lady who says—who says—” “Who says what?” cried the justly incensed magistrate. “This is highly irregular. I forbid it—I absolutely forbid it.” But a slender figure pushed the stammering gendarme aside. Dressed all in black, with a long veil that hid her face, she advanced into"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,24,25 An Unexpected Dénouement,10,"the room. My heart gave a sickening throb. She had come then! All my efforts were in vain. Yet I could not but admire the courage that had led her to take this step so unfalteringly. She raised her veil—and I gasped. For, though as like her as two peas, this girl was not Cinderella! On the other hand, now that I saw her without the fair wig she had worn on the stage, I recognized her as the girl of the photograph in Jack Renauld’s room. “You are the Juge d’Instruction, M. Hautet?” she queried. “Yes, but I forbid—” “My name is Bella Duveen. I wish to give myself up for the murder of Mr. Renauld.”"

If I knew that you forgave me, it would make life easier for me. It wasn’t for myself I did it—that’s the only thing I can put forward to say for myself. “I’ll begin from the day I met you in the boat train from Paris. I was uneasy then about Bella. She was"

She got it into her head that he was keen on another girl—and of course, as it turned out afterwards, she was quite right there. She’d made up her mind to go to their Villa at Merlinville, and try and see Jack. She knew I was against it, and tried to give me the slip. I found she was not on the train at Calais, and determined I would not go on to England without her. I’d an uneasy feeling that something awful was going to happen if I couldn’t prevent it. “I met the next train from"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,25,26 I Receive a Letter,3,"Paris. She was on it, and set upon going out then and there to Merlinville. I argued with her for all I was worth, but it wasn’t any good. She was all strung up and set upon having her own way. Well, I washed my hands of it. I’d done all I could! It was getting late. I went to an hotel, and Bella started for Merlinville. I still couldn’t shake off my feeling of what the books call ‘impending disaster.’ “The next day came—but no Bella. She’d made a date with me to meet at the hotel, but she didn’t keep it. No sign of her all day. I got more and more anxious. Then came an evening paper with the news. “It was awful! I couldn’t be sure, of course—but I"

But it still worried me that Bella hadn’t kept her date with me. “By the next morning, I was so rattled that I’d just got to go and see what I could. First thing, I ran up against you. You know all that… When I saw the dead man, looking so like Jack, and wearing Jack’s fancy overcoat, I knew! And there was the identical paper-knife—wicked little thing!—that Jack had given Bella!

6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,25,26 I Receive a Letter,6,"her what I’d done, and that she was pretty safe for the time being. She stared at me, and then began laughing… laughing… laughing… it was horrible to hear her! I felt that the best thing to do was to keep busy. She’d go mad if she had time to brood on what she’d done. Luckily we got an engagement at once. “And then, I saw you and your friend, watching us that night… I was frantic. You must suspect, or you wouldn’t have tracked us down. I had to know the worst, so I followed you. I was desperate. And then, before I’d had time to say anything, I tumbled to it that it was _me___ you suspected, not Bella! Or at least that you thought I _was___ Bella since I’d stolen"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,25,26 I Receive a Letter,7,"the dagger. “I wish, honey, that you could see back into my mind at that moment… you’d forgive me, perhaps… I was so frightened, and muddled, and desperate.… All I could get clearly was that you would try and save me. I didn’t know whether you’d be willing to save her… I thought very likely not—it wasn’t the same thing! And I couldn’t risk it! Bella’s my twin—I’d got to do the best for her. So I went on lying.… I felt mean—I feel mean still.… That’s all—enough too, you’ll say, I expect. I ought to have trusted you.… If I had— “As soon as the news was in the paper that Jack Renauld had been arrested, it was all up. Bella wouldn’t even wait to see how things went.… “I’m very tired.…"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,25,26 I Receive a Letter,8,"I can’t write any more.…” She had begun to sign herself Cinderella, but had crossed that out and written instead “Dulcie Duveen.” It was an ill-written, blurred epistle but I have kept it to this day. Poirot was with me when I read it. The sheets fell from my hand, and I looked across at him. “Did you know all the time that it was—the other?” “Yes, my friend.” “Why did you not tell me?” “To begin with, I could hardly believe it conceivable that you could make such a mistake. You had seen the photograph. The sisters are very alike, but by no means incapable of distinguishment.” “But the fair hair?” “A wig, worn for the sake of a piquant contrast on the stage. Is it conceivable that with twins one should"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,25,26 I Receive a Letter,9,"be fair and one dark?” “Why didn’t you tell me that night at the hotel in Coventry?” “You were rather high-handed in your methods, _mon ami___,” said Poirot dryly. “You did not give me a chance.” “But afterwards?” “Ah, afterwards! Well, to begin with, I was hurt at your want of faith in me. And then, I wanted to see whether your—feelings would stand the test of time. In fact, whether it was love, or a flash in the pan, with you. I should not have left you long in your error.” I nodded. His tone was too affectionate for me to bear resentment. I looked down on the sheets of the letter. Suddenly I picked them up from the floor, and pushed them across to him. “Read that,” I said. “I’d like"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,25,26 I Receive a Letter,10,"you to.” He read it through in silence, then he looked up at me. “What is it that worries you, Hastings?” This was quite a new mood in Poirot. His mocking manner seemed laid quite aside. I was able to say what I wanted without too much difficulty. “She doesn’t say—she doesn’t say—well, not whether she cares for me or not!” Poirot turned back the pages. “I think you are mistaken, Hastings.” “Where?” I cried, leaning forward eagerly. Poirot smiled. “She tells you that in every line of the letter, _mon ami___.” “But where am I to find her? There’s no address on the letter. There’s a French stamp, that’s all.” “Excite yourself not! Leave it to Papa Poirot. I can find her for you as soon as I have five little minutes!”"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,1,"“Congratulations, M. Jack,” said Poirot, wringing the lad warmly by the hand. Young Renauld had come to us as soon as he was liberated—before starting for Merlinville to rejoin Marthe and his mother. Stonor accompanied him. His heartiness was in strong contrast to the lad’s wan looks. It was plain that the boy was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Although delivered from the immediate peril that was hanging over him, the circumstances of his release were too painful to let him feel full relief. He smiled mournfully at Poirot, and said in a low voice: “I went through it to protect her, and now it’s all no use!” “You could hardly expect the girl to accept the price of your life,” remarked Stonor dryly. “She was bound to come forward when she saw you heading straight for the guillotine.” “_Eh ma foi!___ and you were heading for it too!” added Poirot, with a slight twinkle. “You would have had Maître Grosíer’s death from rage on your conscience if you had gone on.” “He was a well meaning ass, I suppose,” said Jack. “But he worried me horribly. You see, I couldn’t very well take him into my confidence. But, my God! what’s going to happen about Bella?” “If I were you,” said Poirot frankly, “I should not distress myself unduly. The French Courts are very lenient to youth and beauty, and the _crime passionnel___. A clever lawyer will make out a great case of extenuating circumstances. It will not be pleasant for you—” “I don’t care about that. You see, M. Poirot, in a way I _do___ feel guilty of my father’s murder. But for me, and my entanglement with this girl, he would be alive and well today. And then my cursed carelessness in taking away the wrong overcoat. I can’t help feeling responsible for his death. It will haunt me for ever!” “No, no,” I said soothingly. “Of course it’s horrible to me to think that Bella killed my father,” resumed"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,2,"Jack, “but I’d treated her shamefully. After I met Marthe, and realized I’d made a mistake, I ought to have written and told her so honestly. But I was so terrified of a row, and of its coming to Marthe’s ears, and her thinking there was more in it than there ever had been, that—well, I was a coward, and went on hoping the thing would die down of itself. I just drifted, in fact—not realizing that I was driving the poor kid desperate. If she’d really knifed me, as she meant to, I should have got no more than my deserts. And the way she’s come forward now is downright plucky. I’d have stood the racket, you know—up to the end.” He was silent for a moment or two, and then burst out on another tack: “What gets me is why the Governor should be wandering about in underclothes and my overcoat at that time of night. I suppose he’d just given the foreign johnnies the slip, and my mother must have made a mistake about its being 2 o’clock when they came. Or—or, it wasn’t all a frame up, was it? I mean, my mother didn’t think—couldn’t think—that—that it was _me?___” Poirot reassured him quickly. “No, no, M. Jack. Have no fears on that score. As for the rest, I will explain it to you one of these days. It is rather curious. But will you recount to us exactly what did occur on that terrible evening?” “There’s very little to tell. I came from Cherbourg, as I told you, in order to see Marthe before going to the other end of the world. The train was late, and I decided to take the short cut across the golf links. I could easily get into the grounds of the Villa Marguerite from there. I had nearly reached the place when—” He paused and swallowed. “Yes?” “I heard a terrible cry. It wasn’t loud—a sort of choke and gasp—but it frightened me. For a"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,3,"moment I stood rooted to the spot. Then I came round the corner of a bush. There was moonlight. I saw the grave, and a figure lying face downwards, with a dagger sticking in the back. And then—and then—I looked up and saw _her___. She was looking at me as though she saw a ghost—it’s what she must have thought me at first—all expression seemed frozen out of her face by horror. And then she gave a cry, and turned and ran.” He stopped, trying to master his emotion. “And afterwards?” asked Poirot gently. “I really don’t know. I stayed there for a time, dazed. And then I realized I’d better get away as fast as I could. It didn’t occur to me that they would suspect me, but I was afraid of being called upon to give evidence against her. I walked to St. Beauvais as I told you, and got a car from there back to Cherbourg.” A knock came at the door, and a page entered with a telegram which he delivered to Stonor. He tore it open. Then he got up from his seat. “Mrs. Renauld has regained consciousness,” he said. “Ah!” Poirot sprang to his feet. “Let us all go to Merlinville at once!” A hurried departure was made forthwith. Stonor, at Jack’s instance, agreed to stay behind and do all that could be done for Bella Duveen. Poirot, Jack Renauld and I set off in the Renauld car. The run took just over forty minutes. As we approached the doorway of the Villa Marguerite, Jack Renauld shot a questioning glance at Poirot. “How would it be if you went on first—to break the news to my mother that I am free—” “While you break it in person to Mademoiselle Marthe, eh?” finished Poirot, with a twinkle. “But yes, by all means, I was about to propose such an arrangement myself.” Jack Renauld did not wait for more. Stopping the car, he swung himself out, and ran up the path"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,4,"to the front door. We went on in the car to the Villa Geneviève. “Poirot,” I said, “do you remember how we arrived here that first day? And were met by the news of M. Renauld’s murder?” “Ah! yes, truly. Not so long ago, either. But what a lot of things have happened since then—especially for you, _mon ami!___” “Poirot, what have you done about finding Bel—I mean Dulcie?” “Calm yourself, Hastings. I arrange everything.” “You’re being a precious long time about it,” I grumbled. Poirot changed the subject. “Then the beginning, now the end,” he moralized, as we rang the bell. “And, considered as a case, the end is profoundly unsatisfactory.” “Yes, indeed,” I sighed. “You are regarding it from the sentimental standpoint, Hastings. That was not my meaning. We will hope that Mademoiselle Bella will be dealt with leniently, and after all Jack Renauld cannot marry both the girls. I spoke from a professional standpoint. This is not a crime well ordered and regular, such as a detective delights in. The _mise en scène___ designed by Georges Conneau, that indeed is perfect, but the _dénouement___—ah, no! A man killed by accident in a girl’s fit of anger—ah, indeed, what order or method is there in that?” And in the midst of a fit of laughter on my part at Poirot’s peculiarities, the door was opened by Françoise. Poirot explained that he must see Mrs. Renauld at once, and the old woman conducted him upstairs. I remained in the _salon___. It was some time before Poirot reappeared. He was looking unusually grave. “_Vous voilà___, Hastings! _Sacré tonnerre___, but there are squalls ahead!” “What do you mean?” I cried. “I would hardly have credited it,” said Poirot thoughtfully, “but women are very unexpected.” “Here are Jack and Marthe Daubreuil,” I exclaimed, looking out of the window. Poirot bounded out of the room, and met the young couple on the steps outside. “Do not enter. It is better not. Your mother is very upset.” “I know,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,5,"I know,” said Jack Renauld. “I must go up to her at once.” “But no, I tell you. It is better not.” “But Marthe and I—” “In any case, do not take Mademoiselle with you. Mount, if you must, but you would be wise to be guided by me.” A voice on the stairs behind made us all start. “I thank you for your good offices, M. Poirot, but I will make my own wishes clear.” We stared in astonishment. Descending the stairs, leaning upon Léonie’s arm, was Mrs. Renauld, her head still bandaged. The French girl was weeping, and imploring her mistress to return to bed. “Madame will kill herself. It is contrary to all the doctor’s orders!” But Mrs. Renauld came on. “Mother,” cried Jack, starting forward. But with a gesture she drove him back. “I am no mother of yours! You are no son of mine! From this day and hour I renounce you.” “Mother,” cried the lad, stupefied. For a moment she seemed to waver, to falter before the anguish in his voice. Poirot made a mediating gesture, but instantly she regained command of herself. “Your father’s blood is on your head. You are morally guilty of his death. You thwarted and defied him over this girl, and by your heartless treatment of another girl, you brought about his death. Go out from my house. Tomorrow I intend to take such steps as shall make it certain that you shall never touch a penny of his money. Make your way in the world as best you can with the help of the girl who is the daughter of your father’s bitterest enemy!” And slowly, painfully, she retraced her way upstairs. We were all dumbfounded—totally unprepared for such a demonstration. Jack Renauld, worn out with all he had already gone through, swayed and nearly fell. Poirot and I went quickly to his assistance. “He is overdone,” murmured Poirot to Marthe. “Where can we take him?” “But home! To the Villa Marguerite. We"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,6,"will nurse him, my mother and I. My poor Jack!” We got the lad to the Villa, where he dropped limply on to a chair in a semi-dazed condition. Poirot felt his head and hands. “He has fever. The long strain begins to tell. And now this shock on top of it. Get him to bed, and Hastings and I will summon a doctor.” A doctor was soon procured. After examining the patient, he gave it as his opinion that it was simply a case of nerve strain. With perfect rest and quiet, the lad might be almost restored by the next day, but, if excited, there was a chance of brain fever. It would be advisable for some one to sit up all night with him. Finally, having done all we could, we left him in the charge of Marthe and her mother, and set out for the town. It was past our usual hour of dining, and we were both famished. The first restaurant we came to assuaged the pangs of hunger with an excellent _omelette___, and an equally excellent _entrecôte___ to follow. “And now for quarters for the night,” said Poirot, when at length _café noir___ had completed the meal. “Shall we try our old friend, the Hôtel des Bains?” We traced our steps there without more ado. Yes, Messieurs could be accommodated with two good rooms overlooking the sea. Then Poirot asked a question which surprised me. “Has an English lady, Miss Robinson, arrived?” “Yes, monsieur. She is in the little _salon___.” “Ah!” “Poirot,” I cried, keeping pace with him as he walked along the corridor, “who on earth is Miss Robinson?” Poirot beamed kindly on me. “It is that I have arranged you a marriage, Hastings.” “But, I say—” “Bah!” said Poirot, giving me a friendly push over the threshold of the door. “Do you think I wish to trumpet aloud in Merlinville the name of Duveen?” It was indeed Cinderella who rose to greet us. I took her hands"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,7,"in both of mine. My eyes said the rest. Poirot cleared his throat. “_Mes enfants___,” he said, “for the moment we have no time for sentiment. There is work ahead of us. Mademoiselle, were you able to do what I asked you?” In response, Cinderella took from her bag an object wrapped up in paper, and handed it silently to Poirot. The latter unwrapped it. I gave a start—for it was the aeroplane dagger which I understood she had cast into the sea. Strange, how reluctant women always are to destroy the most compromising of objects and documents! “_Très bien, mon enfant___,” said Poirot. “I am pleased with you. Go now and rest yourself. Hastings here and I have work to do. You shall see him tomorrow.” “Where are you going?” asked the girl, her eyes widening. “You shall hear all about it tomorrow.” “Because wherever you’re going, I’m coming too.” “But mademoiselle—” “I’m coming too, I tell you.” Poirot realized that it was futile to argue further. He gave in. “Come then, mademoiselle. But it will not be amusing. In all probability nothing will happen.” The girl made no reply. Twenty minutes later we set forth. It was quite dark now, a close, oppressive evening. Poirot led the way out of the town in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. But when he reached the Villa Marguerite he paused. “I should like to assure myself that all goes well with Jack Renauld. Come with me, Hastings. Mademoiselle will perhaps remain outside. Madame Daubreuil might say something which would wound her.” We unlatched the gate, and walked up the path. As we went round to the side of the house, I drew Poirot’s attention to a window on the first floor. Thrown sharply on the blind was the profile of Marthe Daubreuil. “Ah!” said Poirot. “I figure to myself that that is the room where we shall find Jack Renauld.” Madame Daubreuil opened the door to us. She explained that Jack was much the same,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,8,"but perhaps we would like to see for ourselves. She led us upstairs and into the bedroom. Marthe Daubreuil was embroidering by a table with a lamp on it. She put her finger to her lips as we entered. Jack Renauld was sleeping an uneasy fitful sleep, his head turning from side to side, and his face still unduly flushed. “Is the doctor coming again?” asked Poirot in a whisper. “Not unless we send. He is sleeping—that is the great thing. _Maman___ made him a tisane.” She sat down again with her embroidery as we left the room. Madame Daubreuil accompanied us down the stairs. Since I had learned of her past history, I viewed this woman with increased interest. She stood there with her eyes cast down, the same very faint enigmatical smile that I remembered on her lips. And suddenly I felt afraid of her, as one might feel afraid of a beautiful poisonous snake. “I hope we have not deranged you, madame,” said Poirot politely as she opened the door for us to pass out. “Not at all, monsieur.” “By the way,” said Poirot, as though struck by an afterthought, “M. Stonor has not been in Merlinville today, has he?” I could not at all fathom the point of this question which I well knew to be meaningless as far as Poirot was concerned. Madame Daubreuil replied quite composedly: “Not that I know of.” “He has not had an interview with Mrs. Renauld?” “How should I know that, monsieur?” “True,” said Poirot. “I thought you might have seen him coming or going, that is all. Good night, madame.” “Why—” I began. “No ‘_whys___,’ Hastings. There will be time for that later.” We rejoined Cinderella and made our way rapidly in the direction of the Villa Geneviève. Poirot looked over his shoulder once at the lighted window and the profile of Marthe as she bent over her work. “He is being guarded at all events,” he muttered. Arrived at the Villa Geneviève,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,9,"Poirot took up his stand behind some bushes to the left of the drive, where, whilst enjoying a good view ourselves, we were completely hidden from sight. The Villa itself was in total darkness, everybody was without doubt in bed and asleep. We were almost immediately under the window of Mrs. Renauld’s bedroom, which window, I noticed, was open. It seemed to me that it was upon this spot that Poirot’s eyes were fixed. “What are we going to do?” I whispered. “Watch.” “But—” “I do not expect anything to happen for at least an hour, probably two hours, but the—” But his words were interrupted by a long thin drawn cry: “Help!” A light flashed up in the second floor room on the right hand side of the house. The cry came from there. And even as we watched there came a shadow on the blind as of two people struggling. “_Mille tonnerres!___” cried Poirot. “She must have changed her room!” Dashing forward, he battered wildly on the front door. Then rushing to the tree in the flower-bed, he swarmed up it with the agility of a cat. I followed him, as with a bound he sprang in through the open window. Looking over my shoulder, I saw Dulcie reaching the branch behind me. “Take care,” I exclaimed. “Take care of your grandmother!” retorted the girl. “This is child’s play to me.” Poirot had rushed through the empty room and was pounding on the door leading into the corridor. “Locked and bolted on the outside,” he growled. “And it will take time to burst it open.” The cries for help were getting noticeably fainter. I saw despair in Poirot’s eyes. He and I together put our shoulders to the door. Cinderella’s voice, calm and dispassionate, came from the window: “You’ll be too late, I guess I’m the only one who can do anything.” Before I could move a hand to stop her, she appeared to leap upward into space. I rushed and looked"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,26,27 Jack Renauld’s Story,10,"out. To my horror, I saw her hanging by her hands from the roof, propelling herself along by jerks in the direction of the lighted window. “Good heavens! She’ll be killed,” I cried. “You forget. She’s a professional acrobat, Hastings. It was the providence of the good God that made her insist on coming with us tonight. I only pray that she may be in time. Ah!” A cry of absolute terror floated out on to the night as the girl disappeared through the right-hand window; then in Cinderella’s clear tones came the words: “No, you don’t! I’ve got you—and my wrists are just like steel.” At the same moment the door of our prison was opened cautiously by Françoise. Poirot brushed her aside unceremoniously and rushed down the passage to where the other maids were grouped round the further door. “It’s locked on the inside, monsieur.” There was the sound of a heavy fall within. After a moment or two the key turned and the door swung slowly open. Cinderella, very pale, beckoned us in. “She is safe?” demanded Poirot. “Yes, I was just in time. She was exhausted.” Mrs. Renauld was half sitting, half lying on the bed. She was gasping for breath. “Nearly strangled me,” she murmured painfully. The girl picked up something from the floor and handed it to Poirot. It was a rolled up ladder of silk rope, very fine but quite strong. “A getaway,” said Poirot. “By the window, whilst we were battering at the door. Where is—the other?” The girl stood aside a little and pointed. On the ground lay a figure wrapped in some dark material a fold of which hid the face. “Dead?” She nodded. “I think so.” “Head must have struck the marble fender.” “But who is it?” I cried. “The murderer of M. Renauld, Hastings. And the would-be murderer of Madame Renauld.” Puzzled and uncomprehending, I knelt down, and lifting the fold of cloth, looked into the dead beautiful face of Marthe Daubreuil!"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,1,"I have confused memories of the further events of that night. Poirot seemed deaf to my repeated questions. He was engaged in overwhelming Françoise with reproaches for not having told him of Mrs. Renauld’s change of sleeping quarters. I caught him by the shoulder, determined to attract his attention, and make myself heard. “But you _must___ have known,” I expostulated. “You were taken up to see her this afternoon.” Poirot deigned to attend to me for a brief moment. “She had been wheeled on a sofa into the middle room—her boudoir,” he explained. “But, monsieur,” cried Françoise, “Madame changed her room almost immediately after the crime! The associations—they were too distressing!” “Then why was I not told,” vociferated Poirot, striking the table, and working himself into a first-class passion. “I demand you—why—was—I—not—told? You are an old woman completely imbecile! And Léonie and Denise are no better. All of you are triple idiots! Your stupidity has nearly caused the death of your mistress. But for this courageous child—” He broke off, and, darting across the room to where the girl was bending over ministering to Mrs. Renauld, he embraced her with Gallic fervour—slightly to my annoyance. I was aroused from my condition of mental fog by a sharp command from Poirot to fetch the doctor immediately on Mrs. Renauld’s behalf. After that, I might summon the police. And he added, to complete my dudgeon: “It will hardly be worth your while to return here. I shall be too busy to attend to you, and of Mademoiselle here I make a _garde-malad___.” I retired with what dignity I could command. Having done my errands, I returned to the hotel. I understood next to nothing of what had occurred. The events of the night seemed fantastic and impossible. Nobody would answer my questions. Nobody had seemed to hear them. Angrily, I flung myself into bed,"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,2,"and slept the sleep of the bewildered and utterly exhausted. I awoke to find the sun pouring in through the open windows and Poirot, neat and smiling, sitting beside the bed. “_Enfin___ you wake! But it is that you are a famous sleeper, Hastings! Do you know that it is nearly eleven o’clock?” I groaned and put a hand to my head. “I must have been dreaming,” I said. “Do you know, I actually dreamt that we found Marthe Daubreuil’s body in Mrs. Renauld’s room, and that you declared her to have murdered Mr. Renauld?” “You were not dreaming. All that is quite true.” “But Bella Duveen killed Mr. Renauld?” “Oh, no, Hastings, she did not! She said she did—yes—but that was to save the man she loved from the guillotine.” “What?” “Remember Jack Renauld’s story. They both arrived on the scene at the same instant, and each took the other to be the perpetrator of the crime. The girl stares at him in horror, and then with a cry rushes away. But, when she hears that the crime has been brought home to him, she cannot bear it, and comes forward to accuse herself and save him from certain death.” Poirot leaned back in his chair, and brought the tips of his fingers together in familiar style. “The case was not quite satisfactory to me,” he observed judicially. “All along I was strongly under the impression that we were dealing with a cold-blooded and premeditated crime committed by some one who had been contented (very cleverly) with using M. Renauld’s own plans for throwing the police off the track. The great criminal (as you may remember my remarking to you once) is always supremely simple.” I nodded. “Now, to support this theory, the criminal must have been fully cognizant of Mr. Renauld’s plans. That leads us to Madame Renauld. But"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,3,"facts fail to support any theory of her guilt. Is there any one else who might have known of them? Yes. From Marthe Daubreuil’s own lips we have the admission that she overheard M. Renauld’s quarrel with the tramp. If she could overhear that, there is no reason why she should not have heard everything else, especially if M. and Madame Renauld were imprudent enough to discuss their plans sitting on the bench. Remember how easily you overheard Marthe’s conversation with Jack Renauld from that spot.” “But what possible motive could Marthe have for murdering Mr. Renauld?” I argued. “What motive? Money! M. Renauld was a millionaire several times over, and at his death (or so she and Jack believed) half that vast fortune would pass to his son. Let us reconstruct the scene from the standpoint of Marthe Daubreuil. “Marthe Daubreuil overhears what passes between Renauld and his wife. So far he has been a nice little source of income to the Daubreuil mother and daughter, but now he proposes to escape from their toils. At first, possibly, her idea is to prevent that escape. But a bolder idea takes its place, and one that fails to horrify the daughter of Jeanne Beroldy! At present M. Renauld stands inexorably in the way of her marriage with Jack. If the latter defies his father, he will be a pauper—which is not at all to the mind of Mademoiselle Marthe. In fact, I doubt if she has ever cared a straw for Jack Renauld. She can simulate emotion, but in reality she is of the same cold, calculating type as her mother. I doubt, too, whether she was really very sure of her hold over the boy’s affections. She had dazzled and captivated him, but separated from her, as his father could so easily manage to separate him, she might lose him."
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,4,"But with M. Renauld dead, and Jack the heir to half his millions, the marriage can take place at once, and at a stroke she will attain wealth—not the beggarly thousands that have been extracted from him so far. And her clever brain takes in the simplicity of the thing. It is all so easy. M. Renauld is planning all the circumstances of his death—she has only to step in at the right moment and turn the farce into a grim reality. And here comes in the second point which led me infallibly to Marthe Daubreuil—the dagger! Jack Renauld had _three___ souvenirs made. One he gave to his mother, one to Bella Duveen; was it not highly probable that he had given the third one to Marthe Daubreuil? “So then, to sum up, there were four points of note against Marthe Daubreuil: “(1) Marthe Daubreuil could have overheard M. Renauld’s plans. “(2) Marthe Daubreuil had a direct interest in causing M. Renauld’s death. “(3) Marthe Daubreuil was the daughter of the notorious Madame Beroldy who in my opinion was morally and virtually the murderess of her husband, although it may have been Georges Conneau’s hand which struck the actual blow. “(4) Marthe Daubreuil was the only person, besides Jack Renauld, likely to have the third dagger in her possession.” Poirot paused and cleared his throat. “Of course, when I learned of the existence of the other girl, Bella Duveen, I realized that it was quite possible that _she___ might have killed M. Renauld. The solution did not commend itself to me, because, as I pointed out to you, Hastings, an expert, such as I am, likes to meet a foeman worthy of his steel. Still one must take crimes as one finds them, not as one would like them to be. It did not seem very likely that Bella Duveen would"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,5,"be wandering about carrying a souvenir paper-knife in her hand, but of course she might have had some idea all the time of revenging herself on Jack Renauld. When she actually came forward and confessed to the murder, it seemed that all was over. And yet—I was not satisfied, _mon ami___. _I was not satisfied.…___ “I went over the case again minutely, and I came to the same conclusion as before. If it was _not___ Bella Duveen, the only other person who could have committed the crime was Marthe Daubreuil. But I had not one single proof against her! “And then you showed me that letter from Mademoiselle Dulcie, and I saw a chance of settling the matter once for all. The original dagger was stolen by Dulcie Duveen and thrown into the sea—since, as she thought, it belonged to her sister. But if, by any chance, it was _not___ her sister’s, but the one given by Jack to Marthe Daubreuil—why then, Bella Duveen’s dagger would be still intact! I said no word to you, Hastings (it was no time for romance) but I sought out Mademoiselle Dulcie, told her as much as I deemed needful, and set her to search amongst the effects of her sister. Imagine my elation, when she sought me out (according to my instructions) as Miss Robinson with the precious souvenir in her possession! “In the meantime I had taken steps to force Mademoiselle Marthe into the open. By my orders, Mrs. Renauld repulsed her son, and declared her intention of making a will on the morrow which should cut him off from ever enjoying even a portion of his father’s fortune. It was a desperate step, but a necessary one, and Madame Renauld was fully prepared to take the risk—though unfortunately she also never thought of mentioning her change of room. I suppose she took"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,6,"it for granted that I knew. All happened as I thought. Marthe Daubreuil made a last bold bid for the Renauld millions—and failed!” “What absolutely bewilders me,” I said, “is how she ever got into the house without our seeing her. It seems an absolute miracle. We left her behind at the Villa Marguerite, we go straight to the Villa Geneviève—and yet she is there before us!” “Ah, but we did not leave her behind. She was out of the Villa Marguerite by the back way whilst we were talking to her mother in the hall. That is where, as the Americans say, she ‘put it over’ on Hercule Poirot!” “But the shadow on the blind? We saw it from the road.” “_Eh bien___, when we looked up, Madame Daubreuil had just had time to run upstairs and take her place.” “Madame Daubreuil?” “Yes. One is old, and one is young, one dark, and one fair, but, for the purpose of a silhouette on a blind, their profiles are singularly alike. Even I did not suspect—triple imbecile that I was! I thought I had plenty of time before me—that she would not try to gain admission to the Villa until much later. She had brains, that beautiful Mademoiselle Marthe.” “And her object was to murder Mrs. Renauld?” “Yes. The whole fortune would then pass to her son. But it would have been suicide, _mon ami!___ On the floor by Marthe Daubreuil’s body, I found a pad and a little bottle of chloroform and a hypodermic syringe containing a fatal dose of morphine. You understand? The chloroform first—then when the victim is unconscious the prick of the needle. By the morning the smell of the chloroform has quite disappeared, and the syringe lies where it has fallen from Madame Renauld’s hand. What would he say, the excellent M. Hautet? ‘Poor woman! What"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,7,"did I tell you? The shock of joy, it was too much on top of the rest! Did I not say that I should not be surprised if her brain became unhinged. Altogether a most tragic case, the Renauld Case!’ “However, Hastings, things did not go quite as Mademoiselle Marthe had planned. To begin with, Madame Renauld was awake and waiting for her. There is a struggle. But Madame Renauld is terribly weak still. There is a last chance for Marthe Daubreuil. The idea of suicide is at an end, but if she can silence Madame Renauld with her strong hands, make a getaway with her little silk ladder whilst we are still battering on the inside of the further door, and be back at the Villa Marguerite before we return there, it will be hard to prove anything against her. But she was checkmated—not by Hercule Poirot—but by _la petite acrobate___ with her wrists of steel.” I mused over the whole story. “When did you first begin to suspect Marthe Daubreuil, Poirot? When she told us she had overheard the quarrel in the garden?” Poirot smiled. “My friend, do you remember when we drove into Merlinville that first day? And the beautiful girl we saw standing at the gate? You asked me if I had not noticed a young goddess, and I replied to you that I had seen only a girl with anxious eyes. That is how I have thought of Marthe Daubreuil from the beginning. _The girl with the anxious eyes!___ Why was she anxious? Not on Jack Renauld’s behalf, for she did not know then that he had been in Merlinville the previous evening.” “By the way,” I exclaimed, “how is Jack Renauld?” “Much better. He is still at the Villa Marguerite. But Madame Daubreuil has disappeared. The police are looking for her.” “Was she in with"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,8,"her daughter, do you think?” “We shall never know. Madame is a lady who can keep her secrets. And I doubt very much if the police will ever find her.” “Has Jack Renauld been—told?” “Not yet.” “It will be a terrible shock to him.” “Naturally. And yet, do you know, Hastings, I doubt if his heart was ever seriously engaged. So far we have looked upon Bella Duveen as a siren, and Marthe Daubreuil as the girl he really loved. But I think that if we reversed the terms we should come nearer to the truth. Marthe Daubreuil was very beautiful. She set herself to fascinate Jack, and she succeeded, but remember his curious reluctance to break with the other girl. And see how he was willing to go to the guillotine rather than implicate her. I have a little idea that when he learns the truth he will be horrified—revolted, and his false love will wither away.” “What about Giraud?” “He has a _crise___ of the nerves, that one! He has been obliged to return to Paris.” We both smiled. Poirot proved a fairly true prophet. When at length the doctor pronounced Jack Renauld strong enough to hear the truth, it was Poirot who broke it to him. The shock was indeed terrific. Yet Jack rallied better than I could have supposed possible. His mother’s devotion helped him to live through those difficult days. The mother and son were inseparable now. There was a further revelation to come. Poirot had acquainted Mrs. Renauld with the fact that he knew her secret, and had represented to her that Jack should not be left in ignorance of his father’s past. “To hide the truth, never does it avail, madame! Be brave and tell him everything.” With a heavy heart Mrs. Renauld consented, and her son learned that the father he had loved"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,9,"had been in actual fact a fugitive from justice. A halting question was promptly answered by Poirot. “Reassure yourself, M. Jack. The world knows nothing. As far as I can see, there is no obligation for me to take the police into my confidence. Throughout the case I have acted, not for them, but for your father. Justice overtook him at last, but no one need ever know that he and Georges Conneau were one and the same.” There were, of course, various points in the case that remained puzzling to the police, but Poirot explained things in so plausible a fashion that all query about them was gradually stilled. Shortly after we got back to London, I noticed a magnificent model of a foxhound adorning Poirot’s mantelpiece. In answer to my inquiring glance, Poirot nodded. “_Mais, oui!___ I got my 500 francs! Is he not a splendid fellow? I call him Giraud!” A few days later Jack Renauld came to see us with a resolute expression on his face. “M. Poirot, I’ve come to say good-bye. I’m sailing for South America almost immediately. My father had large interests over the continent, and I mean to start a new life out there.” “You go alone, M. Jack?” “My mother comes with me—and I shall keep Stonor on as my secretary. He likes out of-the-way parts of the world.” “No one else goes with you?” Jack flushed. “You mean—?” “A girl who loves you very dearly—who has been willing to lay down her life for you.” “How could I ask her?” muttered the boy. “After all that has happened, could I go to her and—oh, what sort of a lame story could I tell?” “_Les femmes___—they have a wonderful genius for manufacturing crutches for stories like that.” “Yes, but—I’ve been such a damned fool!” “So have all of us, at one time"
6,The Mysterious Affair at Styles,27,28 Journey’s End,10,"and another,” observed Poirot philosophically. But Jack’s face had hardened. “There’s something else. I’m my father’s son. Would any one marry me, knowing that?” “You are your father’s son, you say. Hastings here will tell you that I believe in heredity—” “Well, then—” “Wait. I know a woman, a woman of courage and endurance, capable of great love, of supreme self-sacrifice—” The boy looked up. His eyes softened. “My mother!” “Yes. You are your mother’s son as well as your father’s. Go then to Mademoiselle Bella. Tell her everything. Keep nothing back—and see what she will say!” Jack looked irresolute. “Go to her as a boy no longer, but a man—a man bowed by the fate of the Past, and the fate of Today, but looking forward to a new and wonderful life. Ask her to share it with you. You may not realize it, but your love for each other has been tested in the fire and not found wanting. You have both been willing to lay down your lives for each other.” And what of Captain Arthur Hastings, humble chronicler of these pages? There is some talk of his joining the Renaulds on a ranch across the seas, but for the end of this story I prefer to go back to a morning in the garden of the Villa Geneviève. “I can’t call you Bella,” I said, “since it isn’t your name. And Dulcie seems so unfamiliar. So it’s got to be Cinderella. Cinderella married the Prince, you remember. I’m not a Prince, but—” She interrupted me. “Cinderella warned him, I’m sure! You see, she couldn’t promise to turn into a princess. She was only a little scullion after all—” “It’s the Prince’s turn to interrupt,” I interpolated. “Do you know what he said?” “No?” “‘Hell!’ said the Prince—and kissed her!” And I suited the action to the word."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,1,"It was close on midnight when a man crossed the Place de la Concorde. In spite of the handsome fur coat which garbed his meagre form, there was something essentially weak and paltry about him. A little man with a face like a rat. A man, one would say, who could never play a conspicuous part, or rise to prominence in any sphere. And yet, in leaping to such a conclusion, an onlooker would have been wrong. For this man, negligible and inconspicuous as he seemed, played a prominent part in the destiny of the world. In an Empire where rats ruled, he was the king of the rats. Even now, an Embassy awaited his return. But he had business to do first--business of which the Embassy was not officially cognizant. His face gleamed white"

His father had been a Polish Jew, a journeyman tailor. It was business such as his father would have loved that took him abroad to-night. He came to the Seine, crossed it, and entered one of the less reputable quarters of Paris. Here he stopped before a tall, dilapidated house and made his way up to an apartment on the fourth floor. He had barely time to knock before the door was opened by a woman who had evidently been awaiting his arrival. She gave him no greeting, but helped him off with his overcoat and then led the way into the tawdrily furnished sitting-room. The electric light was shaded with dirty pink festoons and it softened, but"

Could not disguise, either, the broad Mongolian cast of her countenance. There was no doubt of Olga Demiroff's profession, nor of her nationality. ""All is well, little one?"" ""All is well, Boris Ivanovitch."" He nodded murmuring: ""I do not think I have been followed."" But there was anxiety in his tone. He went to the window, drawing the curtains aside slightly, and peering carefully out. He started away violently. ""There are two men--on the opposite pavement. It looks to me--"" He broke off and began gnawing at his nails--a habit he had when anxious. The Russian girl was shaking her head with a slow, reassuring action. ""They were here before you came."" ""All the same, it looks to me as though they were"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,4,"watching this house."" ""Possibly,"" she admitted indifferently. ""But then--"" ""What of it? Even if they _know_--it will not be _you_ they will follow from here."" A thin, cruel smile came to his lips. ""No,"" he admitted, ""that is true."" He mused for a minute or two and then observed: ""This damned American--he can look after himself as well as anybody."" ""I suppose so."" He went again to the window. ""Tough customers,"" he muttered, with a chuckle. ""Known to the police, I fear. Well, well, I wish Brother Apache good hunting."" Olga Demiroff shook her head. ""If the American is the kind of man they say he is, it will take more than a couple of cowardly apaches to get the better of him."" She paused. ""I wonder--"" ""Well?"" ""Nothing. Only twice this evening a man"

One of them picked it up and returned it to him. A thread-bare device."" ""You mean--that the white-haired man is--their employer?"" ""Something of the kind."" The Russian looked alarmed and uneasy. ""You are sure--the parcel is safe? It has not been tampered with? There has been too much talk ... much too much talk."" He gnawed his nails again. ""Judge for yourself."" She bent to the fireplace, deftly removing the coals. Underneath, from amongst the crumpled balls of newspaper, she selected from the very middle an oblong package wrapped round with grimy newspaper, and handed it to the man. ""Ingenious,"" he said, with a nod of approval. ""The apartment has been searched"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,6,"twice. The mattress on my bed was ripped open."" ""It is as I said,"" he muttered. ""There has been too much talk. This haggling over the price--it was a mistake."" He had unwrapped the newspaper. Inside was a small brown paper parcel. This in turn he unwrapped, verified the contents, and quickly wrapped it up once more. As he did so, an electric bell rang sharply. ""The American is punctual,"" said Olga, with a glance at the clock. She left the room. In a minute she returned ushering in a stranger, a big, broad-shouldered man whose transatlantic origin was evident. His keen glance went from one to the other. ""M. Krassnine?"" he inquired politely. ""I am he,"" said Boris. ""I must apologize for--for the unconventionality of this meeting-place. But secrecy is urgent. I--I cannot afford"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,7,"to be connected with this business in any way."" ""Is that so?"" said the American politely. ""I have your word, have I not, that no details of this transaction will be made public? That is one of the conditions of--sale."" The American nodded. ""That has already been agreed upon,"" he said indifferently. ""Now, perhaps, you will produce the goods."" ""You have the money--in notes?"" ""Yes,"" replied the other. He did not, however, make any attempt to produce it. After a moment's hesitation, Krassnine gestured towards the small parcel on the table. The American took it up and unrolled the wrapping paper. The contents he took over to a small electric lamp and submitted them to a very thorough examination. Satisfied, he drew from his pocket a thick leather wallet and extracted from it a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,8,"wad of notes. These he handed to the Russian, who counted them carefully. ""All right?"" ""I thank you, Monsieur. Everything is correct."" ""Ah!"" said the other. He slipped the brown paper parcel negligently into his pocket. He bowed to Olga. ""Good evening, Mademoiselle. Good evening, M. Krassnine."" He went out shutting the door behind him. The eyes of the two in the room met. The man passed his tongue over his dry lips. ""I wonder--will he ever get back to his hotel?"" he muttered. By common accord, they both turned to the window. They were just in time to see the American emerge into the street below. He turned to the left and marched along at a good pace without once turning his head. Two shadows stole from a doorway and followed noiselessly. Pursuers"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,9,"and pursued vanished into the night. Olga Demiroff spoke. ""He will get back safely,"" she said. ""You need not fear--or hope--whichever it is."" ""Why do you think he will be safe?"" asked Krassnine curiously. ""A man who has made as much money as he has could not possibly be a fool,"" said Olga. ""And talking of money--"" She looked significantly at Krassnine. ""Eh?"" ""My share, Boris Ivanovitch."" With some reluctance, Krassnine handed over two of the notes. She nodded her thanks, with a complete lack of emotion, and tucked them away in her stocking. ""That is good,"" she remarked, with satisfaction. He looked at her curiously. ""You have no regrets, Olga Vassilovna?"" ""Regrets? For what?"" ""For what has been in your keeping. There are women--most women, I believe, who go mad over such things."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,1,1. The Man with the White Hair,10,"She nodded reflectively. ""Yes, you speak truth there. Most women have that madness. I--have not. I wonder now--"" She broke off. ""Well?"" asked the other curiously. ""The American will be safe with them--yes, I am sure of that. But afterwards--"" ""Eh? What are you thinking of?"" ""He will give them, of course, to some woman,"" said Olga thoughtfully. ""I wonder what will happen then...."" She shook herself impatiently and went over to the window. Suddenly she uttered an exclamation and called to her companion. ""See, he is going down the street now--the man I mean."" They both gazed down together. A slim, elegant figure was progressing along at a leisurely pace. He wore an opera hat and a cloak. As he passed a street lamp, the light illumined a thatch of thick white hair."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,1,"The man with the white hair continued on his course, unhurried, and seemingly indifferent to his surroundings. He took a side turning to the right and another one to the left. Now and then he hummed a little air to himself. Suddenly he stopped dead and listened intently. He had heard a certain sound. It might have been the bursting of a tyre or it might have been--a shot. A curious smile played round his lips for a minute. Then he resumed his leisurely walk. On turning a corner he came upon a scene of some activity. A representative of the law was making notes in a pocket-book, and one or two late passers-by had collected on the spot. To one of these"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,2,"the man with the white hair made a polite request for information. ""Something has been happening, yes?"" ""_Mais oui_, Monsieur. Two apaches set upon an elderly American gentleman."" ""They did him no injury?"" ""No, indeed."" The man laughed. ""The American, he had a revolver in his pocket, and before they could attack him, he fired shots so closely round them that they took alarm and fled. The police, as usual, arrived too late."" ""Ah!"" said the inquirer. He displayed no emotion of any kind. Placidly and unconcernedly he resumed his nocturnal strolling. Presently he crossed the Seine and came into the richer areas of the city. It was some twenty minutes later that he came to a stop before a certain house in"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,3,"a quiet but aristocratic thoroughfare. The shop, for shop it was, was a restrained and unpretentious one. D. Papopolous, dealer in antiques, was so known to fame that he needed no advertisement, and indeed most of his business was not done over a counter. M. Papopolous had a very handsome apartment of his own overlooking the Champs Élysées, and it might reasonably be supposed that he would have been found there and not at his place of business at such an hour, but the man with the white hair seemed confident of success as he pressed the obscurely placed bell, having first given a quick glance up and down the deserted street. His confidence was not misplaced. The door opened and a man"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,4,"stood in the aperture. He wore gold rings in his ears and was of a swarthy cast of countenance. ""Good evening,"" said the stranger. ""Your master is within?"" ""The master is here, but he does not see chance visitors at this time of night,"" growled the other. ""I think he will see me. Tell him that his friend M. le Marquis is here."" The man opened the door a little wider and allowed the visitor to enter. The man who gave his name as M. le Marquis had shielded his face with his hand as he spoke. When the man-servant returned with the information that M. Papopolous would be pleased to receive the visitor a further change had taken place in the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,5,"stranger's appearance. The man-servant must have been very unobservant or very well trained for he betrayed no surprise at the small black satin mask which hid the other's features. Leading the way to a door at the end of the hall, he opened it and announced in a respectful murmur: ""_M. le Marquis_."" The figure which rose to receive this strange guest was an imposing one. There was something venerable and patriarchal about M. Papopolous. He had a high domed forehead and a beautiful white beard. His manner had in it something ecclesiastical and benign. ""My dear friend,"" said M. Papopolous. He spoke in French and his tones were rich and unctuous. ""I must apologize,"" said the visitor, ""for the lateness of"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,6,"the hour."" ""Not at all. Not at all,"" said M. Papopolous--""an interesting time of night. You have had, perhaps, an interesting evening?"" ""Not personally,"" said M. le Marquis. ""Not personally,"" repeated M. Papopolous, ""no, no, of course not. And there is news, eh?"" He cast a sharp glance sideways at the other, a glance that was not ecclesiastical or benign in the least. ""There is no news. The attempt failed. I hardly expected anything else."" ""Quite so,"" said M. Papopolous; ""anything crude--"" He waved his hand to express his intense distaste for crudity in any form. There was indeed nothing crude about M. Papopolous nor about the goods he handled. He was well known in most European courts, and kings called him"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,7,"Demetrius in a friendly manner. He had the reputation for the most exquisite discretion. That, together with the nobility of his aspect, had carried him through several very questionable transactions. ""The direct attack--"" said M. Papopolous. He shook his head. ""It answers sometimes--but very seldom."" The other shrugged his shoulders. ""It saves time,"" he remarked, ""and to fail costs nothing--or next to nothing. The other plan--will not fail."" ""Ah,"" said M. Papopolous, looking at him keenly. The other nodded slowly. ""I have great confidence in your--er--reputation,"" said the antique dealer. M. le Marquis smiled gently. ""I think I may say,"" he murmured, ""that your confidence will not be misplaced."" ""You have unique opportunities,"" said the other, with a note of envy in"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,8,"his voice. ""I make them,"" said M. le Marquis. He rose and took up the cloak which he had thrown carelessly on the back of a chair. ""I will keep you informed, M. Papopolous, through the usual channels, but there must be no hitch in your arrangements."" M. Papopolous was pained. ""There is _never_ a hitch in my arrangements,"" he complained. The other smiled, and without any further word of adieu he left the room, closing the door behind him. M. Papopolous remained in thought for a moment stroking his venerable white beard, and then moved across to a second door which opened inwards. As he turned the handle, a young woman, who only too clearly had been leaning against it with"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,9,"her ear to the keyhole, stumbled headlong into the room. M. Papopolous displayed neither surprise nor concern. It was evidently all quite natural to him. ""Well, Zia?"" he asked. ""I did not hear him go,"" explained Zia. She was a handsome young woman, built on Junoesque lines, with dark flashing eyes and such a general air of resemblance to M. Papopolous that it was easy to see they were father and daughter. ""It is annoying,"" she continued vexedly, ""that one cannot see through a keyhole and hear through it at the same time."" ""It has often annoyed me,"" said M. Papopolous, with great simplicity. ""So that is M. le Marquis,"" said Zia slowly. ""Does he always wear a mask, father?"" ""Always."" There"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,2,2. M. le Marquis,10,"was a pause. ""It is the rubies, I suppose?"" asked Zia. Her father nodded. ""What do you think, my little one?"" he inquired, with a hint of amusement in his beady black eyes. ""Of M. le Marquis?"" ""Yes."" ""I think,"" said Zia slowly, ""that it is a very rare thing to find a well-bred Englishman who speaks French as well as that."" ""Ah,"" said M. Papopolous, ""so that is what you think."" As usual, he did not commit himself, but he regarded Zia with benign approval. ""I thought, too,"" said Zia, ""that his head was an odd shape."" ""Massive,"" said her father--""a trifle massive. But then that effect is always created by a wig."" They both looked at each other and smiled."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,1,"Rufus Van Aldin passed through the revolving doors of the Savoy, and walked to the reception desk. The desk clerk smiled a respectful greeting. ""Pleased to see you back again, Mr. Van Aldin,"" he said. The American millionaire nodded his head in a casual greeting. ""Everything all right?"" he asked. ""Yes, sir. Major Knighton is upstairs in the suite now."" Van Aldin nodded again. ""Any mail?"" he vouchsafed. ""They have all been sent up, Mr. Van Aldin. Oh! wait a minute."" He dived into a pigeon hole, and produced a letter. ""Just come this minute,"" he explained. Rufus Van Aldin took the letter from him, and as he saw the handwriting, a woman's flowing hand, his face was suddenly transformed. The harsh contours of it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,2,"softened, and the hard line of his mouth relaxed. He looked a different man. He walked across to the lift with the letter in his hand and the smile still on his lips. In the drawing-room of his suite, a young man was sitting at a desk nimbly sorting correspondence with the ease born of long practice. He sprang up as Van Aldin entered. ""Hallo, Knighton!"" ""Glad to see you back, sir. Had a good time?"" ""So-so!"" said the millionaire unemotionally. ""Paris is rather a one-horse city nowadays. Still--I got what I went over for."" He smiled to himself rather grimly. ""You usually do, I believe,"" said the secretary, laughing. ""That's so,"" agreed the other. He spoke in a matter-of-fact manner, as one stating a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,3,"well-known fact. Throwing off his heavy overcoat, he advanced to the desk. ""Anything urgent?"" ""I don't think so, sir. Mostly the usual stuff. I have not quite finished sorting it out."" Van Aldin nodded briefly. He was a man who seldom expressed either blame or praise. His methods with those he employed were simple; he gave them a fair trial and dismissed promptly those who were inefficient. His selections of people were unconventional. Knighton, for instance, he had met casually at a Swiss resort two months previously. He had approved of the fellow, looked up his war record, and found in it the explanation of the limp with which he walked. Knighton had made no secret of the fact that he was looking for a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,4,"job, and indeed diffidently asked the millionaire if he knew of any available post. Van Aldin remembered, with a grim smile of amusement, the young man's complete astonishment when he had been offered the post of secretary to the great man himself. ""But--but I have no experience of business,"" he had stammered. ""That doesn't matter a cuss,"" Van Aldin had replied. ""I have got three secretaries already to attend to that kind of thing. But I am likely to be in England for the next six months, and I want an Englishman who--well, knows the ropes--and can attend to the social side of things for me."" So far, Van Aldin had found his judgment confirmed. Knighton had proved quick, intelligent, and resourceful, and he had"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,5,"a distinct charm of manner. The secretary indicated three or four letters placed by themselves on the top of the desk. ""It might perhaps be as well, sir, if you glanced at these,"" he suggested. ""The top one is about the Colton agreement--"" But Rufus Van Aldin held up a protesting hand. ""I am not going to look at a durned thing to-night,"" he declared. ""They can all wait till the morning. Except this one,"" he added, looking down at the letter he held in his hand. And again that strange transforming smile stole over his face. Richard Knighton smiled sympathetically. ""Mrs. Kettering?"" he murmured. ""She rang up yesterday and to-day. She seems very anxious to see you at once, sir."" ""Does she, now!"" The"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,6,"smile faded from the millionaire's face. He ripped open the envelope which he held in his hand and took out the enclosed sheet. As he read it his face darkened, his mouth set grimly in the line which Wall Street knew so well, and his brows knit themselves ominously. Knighton turned tactfully away, and went on opening letters and sorting them. A muttered oath escaped the millionaire, and his clenched fist hit the table sharply. ""I'll not stand for this,"" he muttered to himself. ""Poor little girl, it's a good thing she has her old father behind her."" He walked up and down the room for some minutes, his brows drawn together in a scowl. Knighton still bent assiduously over the desk. Suddenly Van"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,7,"Aldin came to an abrupt halt. He took up his overcoat from the chair where he had thrown it. ""Are you going out again, sir?"" ""Yes; I'm going round to see my daughter."" ""If Colton's people ring up--"" ""Tell them to go to the devil,"" said Van Aldin. ""Very well,"" said the secretary unemotionally. Van Aldin had his overcoat on by now. Cramming his hat upon his head, he went towards the door. He paused with his hand upon the handle. ""You are a good fellow, Knighton,"" he said. ""You don't worry me when I am rattled."" Knighton smiled a little, but made no reply. ""Ruth is my only child,"" said Van Aldin, ""and there is no one on this earth who knows quite"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,8,"what she means to me."" A faint smile irradiated his face. He slipped his hand into his pocket. ""Care to see something, Knighton?"" He came back towards the secretary. From his pocket he drew out a parcel carelessly wrapped in brown paper. He tossed off the wrapping and disclosed a big, shabby, red velvet case. In the centre of it were some twisted initials surmounted by a crown. He snapped the case open, and the secretary drew in his breath sharply. Against the slightly dingy white of the interior, the stones glowed like blood. ""My God! sir,"" said Knighton. ""Are they--are they real?"" Van Aldin laughed a quiet little cackle of amusement. ""I don't wonder at your asking that. Amongst these rubies are the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,9,"three largest in the world. Catherine of Russia wore them, Knighton. That centre one there is known as Heart of Fire. It's perfect--not a flaw in it."" ""But,"" the secretary murmured, ""they must be worth a fortune."" ""Four or five hundred thousand dollars,"" said Van Aldin nonchalantly, ""and that is apart from the historical interest."" ""And you carry them about--like that, loose in your pocket?"" Van Aldin laughed amusedly. ""I guess so. You see, they are my little present for Ruthie."" The secretary smiled discreetly. ""I can understand now Mrs. Kettering's anxiety over the telephone,"" he murmured. But Van Aldin shook his head. The hard look returned to his face. ""You are wrong there,"" he said. ""She doesn't know about these; they are my"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,3,3. Heart of Fire,10,"little surprise for her."" He shut the case, and began slowly to wrap it up again. ""It's a hard thing, Knighton,"" he said, ""how little one can do for those one loves. I can buy a good portion of the earth for Ruth, if it would be any use to her, but it isn't. I can hang these things round her neck and give her a moment or two's pleasure, maybe, but--"" He shook his head. ""When a woman is not happy in her home--"" He left the sentence unfinished. The secretary nodded discreetly. He knew, none better, the reputation of the Hon. Derek Kettering. Van Aldin sighed. Slipping the parcel back in his coat pocket, he nodded to Knighton and left the room."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,1,"The Hon. Mrs. Derek Kettering lived in Curzon Street. The butler who opened the door recognized Rufus Van Aldin at once and permitted himself a discreet smile of greeting. He led the way upstairs to the big double drawing-room on the first floor. A woman who was sitting by the window started up with a cry. ""Why, Dad, if that isn't too good for anything! I've been telephoning Major Knighton all day to try and get hold of you, but he couldn't say for sure when you were expected back."" Ruth Kettering was twenty-eight years of age. Without being beautiful, or in the real sense of the word even pretty, she was striking looking because of her colouring. Van Aldin had been called Carrots and Ginger in his time, and Ruth's hair was almost pure auburn. With it went dark eyes and very black lashes--the effect somewhat enhanced by art. She was tall and slender, and moved well. At a careless glance it was the face of a Raphael Madonna. Only if one looked closely did one perceive the same line of jaw and chin"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,2,"as in Van Aldin's face, bespeaking the same hardness and determination. It suited the man, but suited the woman less well. From her childhood upward Ruth Van Aldin had been accustomed to having her own way, and any one who had ever stood up against her soon realized that Rufus Van Aldin's daughter never gave in. ""Knighton told me you'd 'phoned him,"" said Van Aldin. ""I only got back from Paris half an hour ago. What's all this about Derek?"" Ruth Kettering flushed angrily. ""It's unspeakable. It's beyond all limits,"" she cried. ""He--he doesn't seem to listen to anything I say."" There was bewilderment as well as anger in her voice. ""He'll listen to me,"" said the millionaire grimly. Ruth went on. ""I've hardly seen him for the last month. He goes about everywhere with that woman."" ""With what woman?"" ""Mirelle. She dances at the Parthenon, you know."" Van Aldin nodded. ""I was down at Leconbury last week. I--I spoke to Lord Leconbury. He was awfully sweet to me, sympathized entirely. He said he'd give Derek a good talking to."" ""Ah!"" said Van Aldin. ""What"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,3,"do you mean by 'Ah!', Dad?"" ""Just what you think I mean, Ruthie. Poor old Leconbury is a wash-out. Of course he sympathized with you, of course he tried to soothe you down. Having got his son and heir married to the daughter of one of the richest men in the States, he naturally doesn't want to mess the thing up. But he's got one foot in the grave already, every one knows that, and anything he may say will cut darned little ice with Derek."" ""Can't _you_ do anything, Dad?"" urged Ruth, after a minute or two. ""I might,"" said the millionaire. He waited a second reflectively, and then went on. ""There are several things I might do, but there's only one that will be any real good. How much pluck have you got, Ruthie?"" She stared at him. He nodded back at her. ""I mean just what I say. Have you got the grit to admit to all the world that you've made a mistake? There's only one way out of this mess, Ruthie. Cut your losses and start afresh."" ""You mean--"" ""Divorce."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,4,"""Divorce!"" Van Aldin smiled drily. ""You say that word, Ruth, as though you'd never heard it before. And yet your friends are doing it all round you every day."" ""Oh! I know that. But--"" She stopped, biting her lip. Her father nodded comprehendingly. ""I know, Ruth. You're like me, you can't bear to let go. But I've learnt, and you've got to learn, that there are times when it's the only way. I might find ways of whistling Derek back to you, but it would all come to the same in the end. _He's no good_, Ruth; he's rotten through and through. And mind you, I blame myself for ever letting you marry him. But you were kind of set on having him, and he seemed in earnest about turning over a new leaf--and well, I'd crossed you once, honey...."" He did not look at her as he said the last words. Had he done so, he might have seen the swift colour that came up in her face. ""You did,"" she said in a hard voice. ""I was too darned softhearted to do it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,5,"a second time. I can't tell you how I wish I had, though. You've led a poor kind of life for the last few years, Ruth."" ""It has not been very--agreeable,"" agreed Mrs. Kettering. ""That's why I say to you that this thing has got to _stop_!"" He brought his hand down with a bang on the table. ""You may have a hankering after the fellow still. _Cut it out._ Face facts. Derek Kettering married you for your money. That's all there is to it. Get rid of him, Ruth."" Ruth Kettering looked down at the ground for some moments, then she said, without raising her head: ""Supposing he doesn't consent?"" Van Aldin looked at her in astonishment. ""He won't have a say in the matter."" She flushed and bit her lip. ""No--no--of course not. I only meant--"" She stopped. Her father eyed her keenly. ""What did you mean?"" ""I meant--"" She paused, choosing her words carefully. ""He mayn't take it lying down."" The millionaire's chin shot out grimly. ""You mean he'll fight the case? Let him! But, as a matter of fact, you're wrong."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,6,"He won't fight. Any solicitor he consults will tell him he hasn't a leg to stand upon."" ""You don't think""--she hesitated--""I mean--out of sheer spite against me--he might, try to make it awkward?"" Her father looked at her in some astonishment. ""Fight the case, you mean?"" He shook his head. ""Very unlikely. You see, he would have to have something to go upon."" Mrs. Kettering did not answer. Van Aldin looked at her sharply. ""Come, Ruth, out with it. There's something troubling you--what is it?"" ""Nothing, nothing at all."" But her voice was unconvincing. ""You are dreading the publicity, eh? Is that it? You leave it to me. I'll put the whole thing through so smoothly that there will be no fuss at all."" ""Very well, Dad, if you really think it's the best thing to be done."" ""Got a fancy for the fellow still, Ruth? Is that it?"" ""No."" The word came with no uncertain emphasis. Van Aldin seemed satisfied. He patted his daughter on the shoulder. ""It will be all right, little girl. Don't you worry any. Now let's forget all about this."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,7,"I have brought you a present from Paris."" ""For me? Something very nice?"" ""I hope you'll think so,"" said Van Aldin, smiling. He took the parcel from his coat pocket and handed it to her. She unwrapped it eagerly, and snapped open the case. A long-drawn ""Oh!"" came from her lips. Ruth Kettering loved jewels--always had done so. ""Dad, how--how wonderful!"" ""Rather in a class by themselves, aren't they?"" said the millionaire, with satisfaction. ""You like them, eh?"" ""Like them? Dad, they're unique. How did you get hold of them?"" Van Aldin smiled. ""Ah! that's my secret. They had to be bought privately, of course. They are rather well known. See that big stone in the middle? You have heard of it, maybe; that's the historic 'Heart of Fire.'"" ""Heart of Fire!"" repeated Mrs. Kettering. She had taken the stones from the case and was holding them against her breast. The millionaire watched her. He was thinking of the series of women who had worn the jewels. The heartaches, the despairs, the jealousies. ""Heart of Fire,"" like all famous stones, had left behind it a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,8,"trail of tragedy and violence. Held in Ruth Kettering's assured hand, it seemed to lose its potency of evil. With her cool, equable poise, this woman of the western world seemed a negation to tragedy or heart-burnings. Ruth returned the stones to their case; then, jumping up, she flung her arms round her father's neck. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you, Dad! They are wonderful! You do give me the most marvellous presents always."" ""That's all right,"" said Van Aldin, patting her shoulder. ""You are all I have, you know, Ruthie."" ""You will stay to dinner, won't you, father?"" ""I don't think so. You were going out, weren't you?"" ""Yes, but I can easily put that off. Nothing very exciting."" ""No,"" said Van Aldin. ""Keep your engagement. I have got a good deal to attend to. See you to-morrow, my dear. Perhaps if I 'phone you, we can meet at Galbraiths'?"" Messrs. Galbraith, Galbraith, Cuthbertson, & Galbraith were Van Aldin's London solicitors. ""Very well, Dad."" She hesitated. ""I suppose it--this--won't keep me from going to the Riviera?"" ""When are you off?"" ""On the fourteenth."" ""Oh,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,9,"that will be all right. These things take a long time to mature. By the way, Ruth, I shouldn't take those rubies abroad if I were you. Leave them at the bank."" Mrs. Kettering nodded. ""We don't want to have you robbed and murdered for the sake of 'Heart of Fire,'"" said the millionaire jocosely. ""And yet you carried it about in your pocket loose,"" retorted his daughter, smiling. ""Yes--"" Something, some hesitation, caught her attention. ""What is it, Dad?"" ""Nothing."" He smiled. ""Thinking of a little adventure of mine in Paris."" ""An adventure?"" ""Yes, the night I bought these things."" He made a gesture towards the jewel case. ""Oh, do tell me."" ""Nothing to tell, Ruthie. Some apache fellows got a bit fresh and I shot at them and they got off. That's all."" She looked at him with some pride. ""You're a tough proposition, Dad."" ""You bet I am, Ruthie."" He kissed her affectionately and departed. On arriving back at the Savoy, he gave a curt order to Knighton. ""Get hold of a man called Goby; you'll find his address in my private"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,4,4. In Curzon Street,10,"book. He's to be here to-morrow morning at half-past nine."" ""Yes, sir."" ""I also want to see Mr. Kettering. Run him to earth for me if you can. Try his Club--at any rate, get hold of him somehow, and arrange for me to see him here to-morrow morning. Better make it latish, about twelve. His sort aren't early risers."" The secretary nodded in comprehension of these instructions. Van Aldin gave himself into the hands of his valet. His bath was prepared, and as he lay luxuriating in the hot water, his mind went back over the conversation with his daughter. On the whole he was well satisfied. His keen mind had long since accepted the fact that divorce was the only possible way out. Ruth had agreed to the proposed solution with more readiness than he had hoped for. Yet, in spite of her acquiescence, he was left with a vague sense of uneasiness. Something about her manner, he felt, had not been quite natural. He frowned to himself. ""Maybe I'm fanciful,"" he muttered, ""and yet--I bet there's something she has not told me."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,1,"Rufus Van Aldin had just finished the sparse breakfast of coffee and dry toast, which was all he ever allowed himself, when Knighton entered the room. ""Mr. Goby is below, sir, waiting to see you."" The millionaire glanced at the clock. It was just half-past nine. ""All right,"" he said curtly. ""He can come up."" A minute or two later, Mr. Goby entered the room. He was a small, elderly man, shabbily dressed, with eyes that looked carefully all round the room, and never at the person he was addressing. ""Good morning, Goby,"" said the millionaire. ""Take a chair."" ""Thank you, Mr. Van Aldin."" Mr. Goby sat down with his hands on his knees, and gazed earnestly at the radiator. ""I have got a job for you."" ""Yes, Mr. Van Aldin?"" ""My daughter is married to the Hon. Derek Kettering, as you may perhaps know."" Mr. Goby transferred his gaze from the radiator to the left-hand drawer of the desk, and permitted a deprecating smile to pass over his face. Mr. Goby knew a great many things, but he always hated to admit the fact. ""By my advice, she is about to file a petition for divorce. That, of course, is a solicitor's business. But, for private reasons, I want the fullest and most complete information."" Mr. Goby looked at the cornice and murmured: ""About Mr. Kettering?"" ""About Mr. Kettering."" ""Very good, sir."" Mr. Goby rose to his feet. ""When will you have it ready for me?"" ""Are you in a hurry, sir?"" ""I'm always in a hurry,"" said the millionaire. Mr. Goby smiled understandingly at the fender. ""Shall we say two o'clock this afternoon,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,2,"sir?"" he asked. ""Excellent,"" approved the other. ""Good morning, Goby."" ""Good morning, Mr. Van Aldin."" ""That's a very useful man,"" said the millionaire as Goby went out and his secretary came in. ""In his own line he's a specialist."" ""What is his line?"" ""Information. Give him twenty-four hours and he would lay the private life of the Archbishop of Canterbury bare for you."" ""A useful sort of chap,"" said Knighton, with a smile. ""He has been useful to me once or twice,"" said Van Aldin. ""Now then, Knighton, I'm ready for work."" The next few hours saw a vast quantity of business rapidly transacted. It was half-past twelve when the telephone bell rang, and Mr. Van Aldin was informed that Mr. Kettering had called. Knighton looked at Van Aldin, and interpreted his brief nod. ""Ask Mr. Kettering to come up, please."" The secretary gathered up his papers and departed. He and the visitor passed each other in the doorway, and Derek Kettering stood aside to let the other go out. Then he came in, shutting the door behind him. ""Good morning, sir. You are very anxious to see me, I hear."" The lazy voice with its slightly ironic inflection roused memories in Van Aldin. There was charm in it--there had always been charm in it. He looked piercingly at his son-in-law. Derek Kettering was thirty-four, lean of build, with a dark, narrow face, which had even now something indescribably boyish in it. ""Come in,"" said Van Aldin curtly. ""Sit down."" Kettering flung himself lightly into an arm-chair. He looked at his father-in-law with a kind of tolerant amusement. ""Not seen you for a long time,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,3,"sir,"" he remarked pleasantly. ""About two years, I should say. Seen Ruth yet?"" ""I saw her last night,"" said Van Aldin. ""Looking very fit, isn't she?"" said the other lightly. ""I didn't know you had had much opportunity of judging,"" said Van Aldin drily. Derek Kettering raised his eyebrows. ""Oh, we sometimes meet at the same night club, you know,"" he said airily. ""I am not going to beat about the bush,"" Van Aldin said curtly. ""I have advised Ruth to file a petition for divorce."" Derek Kettering seemed unmoved. ""How drastic!"" he murmured. ""Do you mind if I smoke, sir?"" He lit a cigarette, and puffed out a cloud of smoke as he added nonchalantly: ""And what did Ruth say?"" ""Ruth proposes to take my advice,"" said her father. ""Does she really?"" ""Is that all you have got to say?"" demanded Van Aldin sharply. Kettering flicked his ash into the grate. ""I think, you know,"" he said, with a detached air, ""that she's making a great mistake."" ""From your point of view she doubtless is,"" said Van Aldin grimly. ""Oh, come now,"" said the other; ""don't let's be personal. I really wasn't thinking of myself at the moment. I was thinking of Ruth. You know my poor old Governor really can't last much longer; all the doctors say so. Ruth had better give it a couple more years, then I shall be Lord Leconbury, and she can be châtelaine of Leconbury, which is what she married me for."" ""I won't have any of your darned impudence,"" roared Van Aldin. Derek Kettering smiled at him quite unmoved. ""I agree with you. It's an obsolete idea,"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,4,"he said. ""There's nothing in a title nowadays. Still, Leconbury is a very fine old place, and, after all, we are one of the oldest families in England. It will be very annoying for Ruth if she divorces me to find me marrying again, and some other woman queening it at Leconbury instead of her."" ""I am serious, young man,"" said Van Aldin. ""Oh, so am I,"" said Kettering. ""I am in very low water financially; it will put me in a nasty hole if Ruth divorces me, and, after all, if she has stood it for ten years, why not stand it a little longer? I give you my word of honour that the old man can't possibly last out another eighteen months, and, as I said before, it's a pity Ruth shouldn't get what she married me for."" ""You suggest that my daughter married you for your title and position?"" Derek Kettering laughed a laugh that was not all amusement. ""You don't think it was a question of a love match?"" he asked. ""I know,"" said Van Aldin slowly, ""that you spoke very differently in Paris ten years ago."" ""Did I? Perhaps I did. Ruth was very beautiful, you know--rather like an angel or a saint, or something that had stepped down from a niche in a church. I had fine ideas, I remember, of turning over a new leaf, of settling down and living up to the highest traditions of English home-life with a beautiful wife who loved me."" He laughed again, rather more discordantly. ""But you don't believe that, I suppose?"" he said. ""I have no doubt at all that you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,5,"married Ruth for her money,"" said Van Aldin unemotionally. ""And that she married me for love?"" asked the other ironically. ""Certainly,"" said Van Aldin. Derek Kettering stared at him for a minute or two, then he nodded reflectively. ""I see you believe that,"" he said. ""So did I at the time. I can assure you, my dear father-in-law, I was very soon undeceived."" ""I don't know what you are getting at,"" said Van Aldin, ""and I don't care. You have treated Ruth darned badly."" ""Oh, I have,"" agreed Kettering lightly, ""but she's tough, you know. She's your daughter. Underneath the pink-and-white softness of her she's as hard as granite. You have always been known as a hard man, so I have been told, but Ruth is harder than you are. You, at any rate, love one person better than yourself. Ruth never has and never will."" ""That is enough,"" said Van Aldin. ""I asked you here so that I could tell you fair and square what I meant to do. My girl has got to have some happiness, and remember this, I am behind her."" Derek Kettering got up and stood by the mantelpiece. He tossed away his cigarette. When he spoke, his voice was very quiet. ""What exactly do you mean by that, I wonder?"" he said. ""I mean,"" said Van Aldin, ""that you had better not try to defend the case."" ""Oh,"" said Kettering. ""Is that a threat?"" ""You can take it any way you please,"" said Van Aldin. Kettering drew a chair up to the table. He sat down fronting the millionaire. ""And supposing,"" he said softly, ""that, just for argument's"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,6,"sake, I did defend the case?"" Van Aldin shrugged his shoulders. ""You have not got a leg to stand upon, you young fool. Ask your solicitors, they will soon tell you. Your conduct has been notorious, the talk of London."" ""Ruth has been kicking up a row about Mirelle, I suppose. Very foolish of her. I don't interfere with her friends."" ""What do you mean?"" said Van Aldin sharply. Derek Kettering laughed. ""I see you don't know everything sir,"" he said. ""You are, perhaps naturally, prejudiced."" He took up his hat and stick and moved towards the door. ""Giving advice is not much in my line."" He delivered his final thrust. ""But, in this case, I should advise most strongly perfect frankness between father and daughter."" He passed quickly out of the room and shut the door behind him just as the millionaire sprang up. ""Now, what the hell did he mean by that?"" said Van Aldin as he sank back into his chair again. All his uneasiness returned in full force. There was something here that he had not yet got to the bottom of. The telephone was by his elbow; he seized it, and asked for the number of his daughter's house. ""Hallo! Hallo! Is that Mayfair 81907? Mrs. Kettering in? Oh, she's out, is she? Yes, out to lunch. What time will she be in? You don't know? Oh, very good; no, there's no message."" He slammed the receiver down again angrily. At two o'clock he was pacing the floor of his room waiting expectantly for Goby. The latter was ushered in at ten minutes past two. ""Well?"" barked the millionaire"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,7,"sharply. But little Mr. Goby was not to be hurried. He sat down at the table, produced a very shabby pocket-book, and proceeded to read from it in a monotonous voice. The millionaire listened attentively, with an increasing satisfaction. Goby came to a full stop, and looked attentively at the wastepaper-basket. ""Um!"" said Van Aldin. ""That seems pretty definite. The case will go through like winking. The hotel evidence is all right, I suppose?"" ""Cast iron,"" said Mr. Goby, and looked malevolently at a gilt arm-chair. ""And financially he's in very low water. He's trying to raise a loan now, you say? Has already raised practically all he can upon his expectations from his father. Once the news of the divorce gets about, he won't be able to raise another cent, and not only that, his obligations can be bought up and pressure can be put upon him from that quarter. We have got him, Goby; we have got him in a cleft stick."" He hit the table a bang with his fist. His face was grim and triumphant. ""The information,"" said Mr. Goby in a thin voice, ""seems satisfactory."" ""I have got to go round to Curzon Street now,"" said the millionaire. ""I am much obliged to you, Goby. You are the goods all right."" A pale smile of gratification showed itself on the little man's face. ""Thank you, Mr. Van Aldin,"" he said; ""I try to do my best."" Van Aldin did not go direct to Curzon Street. He went first to the City, where he had two interviews which added to his satisfaction. From there he took the tube to Down"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,8,"Street. As he was walking along Curzon Street, a figure came out of No. 160, and turned up the street towards him, so that they passed each other on the pavement. For a moment, the millionaire had fancied it might be Derek Kettering himself; the height and build were not unlike. But as they came face to face, he saw that the man was a stranger to him. At least--no, not a stranger; his face awoke some call of recognition in the millionaire's mind, and it was associated definitely with something unpleasant. He cudgelled his brains in vain, but the thing eluded him. He went on, shaking his head irritably. He hated to be baffled. Ruth Kettering was clearly expecting him. She ran to him and kissed him when he entered. ""Well, Dad, how are things going?"" ""Very well,"" said Van Aldin; ""but I have got a word or two to say to you, Ruth."" Almost insensibly he felt the change in her; something shrewd and watchful replaced the impulsiveness of her greeting. She sat down in a big arm-chair. ""Well, Dad?"" she asked. ""What is it?"" ""I saw your husband this morning,"" said Van Aldin. ""You saw Derek?"" ""I did. He said a lot of things, most of which were darned cheek. Just as he was leaving, he said something that I didn't understand. He advised me to be sure that there was perfect frankness between father and daughter. What did he mean by that, Ruthie?"" Mrs. Kettering moved a little in her chair. ""I--I don't know, Dad. How should I?"" ""Of course you know,"" said Van Aldin. ""He said something else, about"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,9,"his having his friends and not interfering with yours. What did he mean by that?"" ""I don't know,"" said Ruth Kettering again. Van Aldin sat down. His mouth set itself in a grim line. ""See here, Ruth. I am not going into this with my eyes closed. I am not at all sure that that husband of yours doesn't mean to make trouble. Now, he can't do it, I am sure of that. I have got the means to silence him, to shut his mouth for good and all, but I have got to know if there's any need to use those means. What did he mean by your having your own friends?"" Mrs. Kettering shrugged her shoulders. ""I have got lots of friends,"" she said uncertainly. ""I don't know what he meant, I am sure."" ""You do,"" said Van Aldin. He was speaking now as he might have spoken to a business adversary. ""I will put it plainer. Who is the man?"" ""What man?"" ""_The_ man. That's what Derek was driving at. Some special man who is a friend of yours. You needn't worry, honey, I know there is nothing in it, but we have got to look at everything as it might appear to the Court. They can twist these things about a good deal, you know. I want to know who the man is, and just how friendly you have been with him."" Ruth didn't answer. Her hands were kneading themselves together in intense nervous absorption. ""Come, honey,"" said Van Aldin in a softer voice. ""Don't be afraid of your old Dad. I was not too harsh, was I, even that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,5,5. A Useful Gentleman,10,"time in Paris?--By gosh!"" He stopped, thunderstruck. ""That's who it was,"" he murmured to himself. ""I thought I knew his face."" ""What are you talking about, Dad? I don't understand."" The millionaire strode across to her and took her firmly by the wrist. ""See here, Ruth, have you been seeing that fellow again?"" ""What fellow?"" ""The one we had all that fuss about years ago. You know who I mean well enough."" ""You mean""--she hesitated--""you mean the Comte de la Roche?"" ""Comte de la Roche!"" snorted Van Aldin. ""I told you at the time that the man was no better than a swindler. You had entangled yourself with him then very deeply, but I got you out of his clutches."" ""Yes, you did,"" said Ruth bitterly. ""And I married Derek Kettering."" ""You wanted to,"" said the millionaire sharply. She shrugged her shoulders. ""And now,"" said Van Aldin slowly, ""you have been seeing him again--after all I told you. He has been in the house to-day. I met him outside, and couldn't place him for the moment."" Ruth Kettering had recovered her composure. ""I want to tell you one thing, Dad; you are wrong about Armand--the Comte de la Roche, I mean. Oh, I know there were several regrettable incidents in his youth--he has told me about them; but--well, he has cared for me always. It broke his heart when you parted us in Paris, and now--"" She was interrupted by the snort of indignation her father gave. ""So you fell for that stuff, did you? You, a daughter of mine! My God!"" He threw up his hands. ""That women can be such darned fools!"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,1,"Derek Kettering emerged from Van Aldin's suite so precipitantly that he collided with a lady passing across the corridor. He apologized, and she accepted his apologies with a smiling reassurance and passed on, leaving with him a pleasant impression of a soothing personality and rather fine grey eyes. For all his nonchalance, his interview with his father-in-law had shaken him more than he cared to show. He had a solitary lunch, and after it, frowning to himself a little, he went around to the sumptuous flat that housed the lady known as Mirelle. A trim Frenchwoman received him with smiles. ""But enter then, Monsieur. Madame reposes herself."" He was ushered into the long room with its Eastern setting which he knew so well. Mirelle was lying on the divan, supported by an incredible number of cushions, all in varying shades of amber, to harmonize with the yellow ochre of her complexion. The dancer was a beautifully made woman, and if her face, beneath its mask of yellow, was in truth somewhat haggard, it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,2,"had a bizarre charm of its own, and her orange lips smiled invitingly at Derek Kettering. He kissed her, and flung himself into a chair. ""What have you been doing with yourself? Just got up, I suppose?"" The orange mouth widened into a long smile. ""No,"" said the dancer. ""I have been at work."" She flung out a long, pale hand towards the piano, which was littered with untidy music scores. ""Ambrose has been here. He has been playing me the new Opera."" Kettering nodded without paying much attention. He was profoundly uninterested in Claud Ambrose and the latter's operatic setting of Ibsen's _Peer Gynt_. So was Mirelle, for that matter, regarding it merely as a unique opportunity for her own presentation as Anitra. ""It is a marvellous dance,"" she murmured. ""I shall put all the passion of the desert into it. I shall dance hung over with jewels--ah! and, by the way, _mon ami_, there is a pearl that I saw yesterday in Bond Street--a black pearl."" She paused, looking at him"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,3,"invitingly. ""My dear girl,"" said Kettering, ""it's no use talking of black pearls to me. At the present minute, as far as I am concerned, the fat is in the fire."" She was quick to respond to his tone. She sat up, her big black eyes widening. ""What is that you say, Dereek? What has happened?"" ""My esteemed father-in-law,"" said Kettering, ""is preparing to go off the deep-end."" ""Eh?"" ""In other words, he wants Ruth to divorce me."" ""How stupid!"" said Mirelle. ""Why should she want to divorce you?"" Derek Kettering grinned. ""Mainly because of you, _chérie_!"" he said. Mirelle shrugged her shoulders. ""That is foolish,"" she observed in a matter-of-fact voice. ""Very foolish,"" agreed Derek. ""What are you going to do about it?"" demanded Mirelle. ""My dear girl, what can I do? On the one side, the man with unlimited money; on the other side, the man with unlimited debts. There is no question as to who will come out on top."" ""They are extraordinary, these Americans,"" commented Mirelle. ""It is not"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,4,"as though your wife were fond of you."" ""Well,"" said Derek, ""what are we going to do about it?"" She looked at him inquiringly. He came over and took both her hands in his. ""Are you going to stick to me?"" ""What do you mean? After--"" ""Yes,"" said Kettering. ""After, when the creditors come down like wolves on the fold. I am damned fond of you, Mirelle; are you going to let me down?"" She pulled her hands away from him. ""You know I adore you, Dereek."" He caught the note of evasion in her voice. ""So that's that, is it? The rats will leave the sinking ship."" ""Ah, Dereek!"" ""Out with it,"" he said violently. ""You will fling me over; is that it?"" She shrugged her shoulders. ""I am fond of you, _mon ami_--indeed I am fond of you. You are very charming--_un beau garçon_, but _ce n'est pas pratique_."" ""You are a rich man's luxury, eh? Is that it?"" ""If you like to put it that way."" She leaned back on"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,5,"the cushions, her head flung back. ""All the same, I am fond of you, Dereek."" He went over to the window and stood there some time looking out, with his back to her. Presently the dancer raised herself on her elbow and stared at him curiously. ""What are you thinking of, _mon ami_?"" He grinned at her over his shoulder, a curious grin, that made her vaguely uneasy. ""As it happened, I was thinking of a woman, my dear."" ""A woman, eh?"" Mirelle pounced on something that she could understand. ""You are thinking of some other woman, is that it?"" ""Oh, you needn't worry; it is purely a fancy portrait. 'Portrait of a lady with grey eyes.'"" Mirelle said sharply, ""When did you meet her?"" Derek Kettering laughed, and his laughter had a mocking, ironical sound. ""I ran into the lady in the corridor of the Savoy Hotel."" ""Well! What did she say?"" ""As far as I can remember, I said, 'I beg your pardon,' and she said, 'It doesn't matter,' or words"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,6,"to that effect."" ""And then?"" persisted the dancer. Kettering shrugged his shoulders. ""And then--nothing. That was the end of the incident."" ""I don't understand a word of what you are talking about,"" declared the dancer. ""Portrait of a lady with grey eyes,"" murmured Derek reflectively. ""Just as well I am never likely to meet her again."" ""Why?"" ""She might bring me bad luck. Women do."" Mirelle slipped quickly from her couch, and came across to him, laying one long, snake-like arm round his neck. ""You are foolish, Dereek,"" she murmured. ""You are very foolish. You are _beau garçon_, and I adore you, but I am not made to be poor--no, decidedly I am not made to be poor. Now listen to me; everything is very simple. You must make it up with your wife."" ""I am afraid that's not going to be actually in the sphere of practical politics,"" said Derek drily. ""How do you say? I do not understand."" ""Van Aldin, my dear, is not taking any. He is the kind"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,7,"of man who makes up his mind and sticks to it."" ""I have heard of him,"" nodded the dancer. ""He is very rich, is he not? Almost the richest man in America. A few days ago, in Paris, he bought the most wonderful ruby in the world--'Heart of Fire' it is called."" Kettering did not answer. The dancer went on musingly: ""It is a wonderful stone--a stone that should belong to a woman like me. I love jewels, Dereek; they say something to me. Ah! to wear a ruby like 'Heart of Fire.'"" She gave a little sigh, and then became practical once more. ""You don't understand these things, Dereek; you are only a man. Van Aldin will give these rubies to his daughter, I suppose. Is she his only child?"" ""Yes."" ""Then when he dies, she will inherit all his money. She will be a rich woman."" ""She is a rich woman already,"" said Kettering drily. ""He settled a couple of millions on her at her marriage."" ""A couple of millions!"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,8,"But that is immense. And if she died suddenly, eh? That would all come to you?"" ""As things stand at present,"" said Kettering slowly, ""it would. As far as I know she has not made a will."" ""_Mon Dieu!_"" said the dancer. ""If she were to die, what a solution that would be."" There was a moment's pause, and then Derek Kettering laughed outright. ""I like your simple, practical mind, Mirelle, but I am afraid what you desire won't come to pass. My wife is an extremely healthy person."" ""_Eh, bien!_"" said Mirelle; ""there are accidents."" He looked at her sharply but did not answer. She went on. ""But you are right, _mon ami_, we must not dwell on possibilities. See now, my little Dereek, there must be no more talk of this divorce. Your wife must give up the idea."" ""And if she won't?"" The dancer's eyes narrowed to slits. ""I think she will, my friend. She is one of those who would not like the publicity. There are one or"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,9,"two pretty stories that she would not like her friends to read in the newspapers."" ""What do you mean?"" asked Kettering sharply. Mirelle laughed, her head thrown back. ""_Parbleu!_ I mean the gentleman who calls himself the Comte de la Roche. I know all about him. I am Parisienne, you remember. He was her lover before she married you, was he not?"" Kettering took her sharply by the shoulders. ""That is a damned lie,"" he said, ""and please remember that, after all, you are speaking of my wife."" Mirelle was a little sobered. ""You are extraordinary, you English,"" she complained. ""All the same, I dare say that you may be right. The Americans are so cold, are they not? But you will permit me to say, _mon ami_, that she was _in love with him_ before she married you, and her father stepped in and sent the Comte about his business. And the little Mademoiselle, she wept many tears! But she obeyed. Still, you must know as well as I do, Dereek,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,6,6. Mirelle,10,"that it is a very different story now. She sees him nearly every day, and on the fourteenth she goes to Paris to meet him."" ""How do you know all this?"" demanded Kettering. ""Me? I have friends in Paris, my dear Dereek, who know the Comte intimately. It is all arranged. She is going to the Riviera, so she says, but in reality the Comte meets her in Paris and--who knows! Yes, yes, you can take my word for it, it is all arranged."" Derek Kettering stood motionless. ""You see,"" purred the dancer, ""if you are clever, you have her in the hollow of your hand. You can make things very awkward for her."" ""Oh, for God's sake be quiet,"" cried Kettering. ""Shut your cursed mouth!"" Mirelle flung herself down again on the divan with a laugh. Kettering caught up his hat and coat and left the flat, banging the door violently. And still the dancer sat on the divan and laughed softly to herself. She was not displeased with her work."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,1,"""_Mrs. Samuel Harfield presents her compliments to Miss Katherine Grey and wishes to point out that under the circumstances Miss Grey may not be aware--_"" Mrs. Harfield, having written so far fluently, came to a dead stop, held up by what has proved an insuperable difficulty to many other people--namely, the difficulty of expressing oneself fluently in the third person. After a minute or two of hesitation, Mrs. Harfield tore up the sheet of notepaper and started afresh. ""_Dear Miss Grey--Whilst fully appreciating the adequate way you discharged your duties to my Cousin Jane (whose recent death has indeed been a severe blow to us all), I cannot but feel--_"" Again Mrs. Harfield came to a stop. Once more the letter was consigned to the wastepaper-basket. It was not until four false starts had been made that Mrs. Harfield at last produced an epistle that satisfied her. It was duly sealed and stamped and addressed to Miss Katherine Grey, Little Crampton, St. Mary Mead, Kent, and it lay beside that lady's plate on the following morning at breakfast-time in company with a more important looking communication in a long blue envelope. Katherine Grey opened Mrs. Harfield's letter first. The finished production ran as follows: ""_Dear Miss Grey--My husband and I wish to express our thanks to you for your services to my poor cousin, Jane. Her death has been a great"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,2,"blow to us, though we were, of course, aware that her mind has been failing for some time past. I understand that her latter testamentary dispositions have been of a most peculiar character, and they would not hold good, of course, in any court of law. I have no doubt that, with your usual good sense, you have already realized this fact. If these matters can be arranged privately it is always so much better, my husband says. We shall be pleased to recommend you most highly for a similar post and hope that you will also accept a small present. Believe me, dear Miss Grey, Yours cordially,_ _Mary Anne Harfield._"" Katherine Grey read the letter through, smiled a little, and read it a second time. Her face as she laid the letter down after the second reading was distinctly amused. Then she took up the second letter. After one brief perusal she laid it down and stared very straight in front of her. This time she did not smile. Indeed, it would have been hard for any one watching her to guess what emotions lay behind that quiet, reflective gaze. Katherine Grey was thirty-three. She came of good family, but her father had lost all his money, and Katherine had had to work for her living from an early age. She had been just twenty-three when she had come to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,3,"old Mrs. Harfield as companion. It was generally recognized that old Mrs. Harfield was ""difficult."" Companions came and went with startling rapidity. They arrived full of hope and they usually left in tears. But from the moment Katherine Grey set foot in Little Crampton, ten years ago, perfect peace had reigned. No one knows how these things come about. Snake-charmers, they say, are born, not made. Katherine Grey was born with the power of managing old ladies, dogs, and small boys, and she did it without any apparent sense of strain. At twenty-three she had been a quiet girl with beautiful eyes. At thirty-three she was a quiet woman, with those same grey eyes, shining steadily out on the world with a kind of happy serenity that nothing could shake. Moreover, she had been born with, and still possessed, a sense of humour. As she sat at the breakfast-table, staring in front of her, there was a ring at the bell, accompanied by a very energetic rat-a-tat-tat at the knocker. In another minute the little maid-servant opened the door and announced rather breathlessly: ""Dr. Harrison."" The big, middle-aged doctor came bustling in with the energy and breeziness that had been foreshadowed by his onslaught on the knocker. ""Good morning, Miss Grey."" ""Good morning, Dr. Harrison."" ""I dropped in early,"" began the doctor, ""in case you should have heard from one of"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,4,"those Harfield cousins. Mrs. Samuel, she calls herself--a perfectly poisonous person."" Without a word, Katherine picked up Mrs. Harfield's letter from the table and gave it to him. With a good deal of amusement she watched his perusal of it, the drawing together of the bushy eyebrows, the snorts and grunts of violent disapproval. He dashed it down again on the table. ""Perfectly monstrous,"" he fumed. ""Don't you let it worry you, my dear. They're talking through their hat. Mrs. Harfield's intellect was as good as yours or mine and you won't get any one to say the contrary. They wouldn't have a leg to stand upon, and they know it. All that talk of taking it into court is pure bluff. Hence, this attempt to get round you in a hole-and-corner way. And look here, my dear, don't let them get round you with soft soap either. Don't get fancying it's your duty to hand over the cash, or any tomfoolery of conscientious scruples."" ""I'm afraid it hasn't occurred to me to have scruples,"" said Katherine. ""All these people are distant relatives of Mrs. Harfield's husband, and they never came near her or took any notice of her in her lifetime."" ""You're a sensible woman,"" said the doctor. ""I know, none better, that you've had a hard life of it for the last ten years. You're fully entitled to enjoy"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,5,"the old lady's savings, such as they were."" Katherine smiled thoughtfully. ""Such as they were,"" she repeated. ""You've no idea of the amount, doctor?"" ""Well--enough to bring in five hundred a year or so, I suppose."" Katherine nodded. ""That's what I thought,"" she said. ""Now read this."" She handed him the letter she had taken from the long blue envelope. The doctor read and uttered an exclamation of utter astonishment. ""Impossible,"" he muttered. ""Impossible."" ""She was one of the original shareholders in Mortaulds. Forty years ago she must have had an income of eight or ten thousand a year. She has never, I am sure, spent more than four hundred a year. She was always terribly careful about money. I always believed that she was obliged to be careful about every penny."" ""And all the time the income has accumulated at compound interest. My dear, you're going to be a very rich woman."" Katherine Grey nodded. ""Yes,"" she said, ""I am."" She spoke in a detached, impersonal tone, as though she were looking at the situation from outside. ""Well,"" said the doctor, preparing to depart, ""you have all my congratulations."" He flicked Mrs. Samuel Harfield's letter with his thumb. ""Don't worry about that woman and her odious letter."" ""It really isn't an odious letter,"" said Miss Grey tolerantly. ""Under the circumstances, I think it's really quite a natural thing to do."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,6,"""I have the gravest suspicions of you sometimes,"" said the doctor. ""Why?"" ""The things that you find perfectly natural."" Katherine Grey laughed. Doctor Harrison retailed the great news to his wife at lunch-time. She was very excited about it. ""Fancy old Mrs. Harfield--with all that money. I'm glad she left it to Katherine Grey. That girl's a saint."" The doctor made a wry face. ""Saints I always imagine must have been difficult people. Katherine Grey is too human for a saint."" ""She's a saint with a sense of humour,"" said the doctor's wife, twinkling. ""And, though I don't suppose you've ever noticed the fact, she's extremely good looking."" ""Katherine Grey?"" The doctor was honestly surprised. ""She's got very nice eyes, I know."" ""Oh, you men!"" cried his wife. ""Blind as bats. Katherine's got all the makings of a beauty in her. All she wants is clothes!"" ""Clothes? What's wrong with her clothes? She always looks very nice."" Mrs. Harrison gave an exasperated sigh, and the doctor rose preparatory to starting on his rounds. ""You might look in on her, Polly,"" he suggested. ""I'm going to,"" said Mrs. Harrison promptly. She made her call about three o'clock. ""My dear, I'm so glad,"" she said warmly, as she squeezed Katherine's hand. ""And every one in the village will be glad too."" ""It's very nice of you to come and tell me,"" said Katherine."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,7,"""I hoped you would come in because I wanted to ask about Johnnie."" ""Oh! Johnnie. Well--"" Johnnie was Mrs. Harrison's youngest son. In another minute she was off, retailing a long history in which Johnnie's adenoids and tonsils bulked largely. Katherine listened sympathetically. Habits die hard. Listening had been her portion for ten years now. ""My dear, I wonder if I ever told you about that naval ball at Portsmouth? When Lord Charles admired my gown?"" And composedly, kindly, Katherine would reply: ""I rather think you have, Mrs. Harfield, but I've forgotten about it. Won't you tell it me again?"" And then the old lady would start off full swing, with numerous details. And half of Katherine's mind would be listening, saying the right things mechanically when the old lady paused.... Now, with that same curious feeling of duality to which she was accustomed, she listened to Mrs. Harrison. At the end of half an hour, the latter recalled herself suddenly. ""I've been talking about myself all this time,"" she exclaimed. ""And I came here to talk about you and your plans."" ""I don't know that I've got any yet."" ""My dear--you're not going to stay on _here_."" Katherine smiled at the horror in the other's tone. ""No; I think I want to travel. I've never seen much of the world, you know."" ""I should think not. It must have"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,8,"been an awful life for you cooped up here all these years."" ""I don't know,"" said Katherine. ""It gave me a lot of freedom."" She caught the other's gasp, and reddened a little. ""It must sound foolish--saying that. Of course, I hadn't much freedom in the downright physical sense--"" ""I should think not,"" breathed Mrs. Harrison, remembering that Katherine had seldom had that useful thing--a ""day off."" ""But, in a way, being tied physically gives you lots of scope mentally. You're always free to think. I've had a lovely feeling always of mental freedom."" Mrs. Harrison shook her head. ""I can't understand that."" ""Oh! you would if you'd been in my place. But, all the same, I feel I want a change. I want--well, I want things to happen. Oh! not to me--I don't mean that. But to be in the midst of things, exciting things--even if I'm only the looker-on. You know, things don't happen in St. Mary Mead."" ""They don't indeed,"" said Mrs. Harrison, with fervour. ""I shall go to London first,"" said Katherine. ""I have to see the solicitors, anyway. After that, I shall go abroad, I think."" ""Very nice."" ""But, of course, first of all--"" ""Yes?"" ""I must get some clothes."" ""Exactly what I said to Arthur this morning,"" cried the doctor's wife. ""You know, Katherine, you could look positively beautiful if you tried."" Miss Grey"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,9,"laughed unaffectedly. ""Oh! I don't think you could ever make a beauty out of me,"" she said sincerely. ""But I shall enjoy having some really good clothes. I'm afraid I'm talking about myself an awful lot."" Mrs. Harrison looked at her shrewdly. ""It must be quite a novel experience for you,"" she said drily. Katherine went to say good-bye to old Miss Viner before leaving the village. Miss Viner was two years older than Mrs. Harfield, and her mind was mainly taken with her own success in outliving her dead friend. ""You wouldn't have thought I'd have outlasted Jane Harfield, would you?"" she demanded triumphantly of Katherine. ""We were at school together, she and I. And here we are, she taken, and I left. Who would have thought it?"" ""You've always eaten brown bread for supper, haven't you?"" murmured Katherine mechanically. ""Fancy your remembering that, my dear. Yes; if Jane Harfield had had a slice of brown bread every evening and taken a little stimulant with her meals she might be here to-day."" The old lady paused, nodding her head triumphantly, then added in sudden remembrance: ""And so you've come into a lot of money, I hear? Well, well. Take care of it. And you're going up to London to have a good time? Don't think you'll get married, though, my dear, because you won't. You're not the kind to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,7,7. Letters,10,"attract the men. And, besides, you're getting on. How old are you now?"" ""Thirty-three,"" Katherine told her. ""Well,"" remarked Miss Viner doubtfully, ""that's not so very bad. You've lost your first freshness, of course."" ""I'm afraid so,"" said Katherine, much entertained. ""But you're a very nice girl,"" said Miss Viner kindly. ""And I'm sure there's many a man might do worse than take you for a wife instead of one of these flibbertigibbets running about nowadays showing more of their legs than the Creator ever intended them to. Good-bye, my dear, and I hope you'll enjoy yourself, but things are seldom what they seem in this life."" Heartened by these prophecies, Katherine took her departure. Half the village came to see her off at the station, including the little maid of all work, Alice, who brought a stiff wired nosegay and cried openly. ""There ain't a many like her,"" sobbed Alice when the train had finally departed. ""I'm sure when Charlie went back on me with that girl from the Dairy, nobody could have been kinder than Miss Grey was, and though particular about the brasses and the dust, she was always one to notice when you'd give a thing an extra rub. Cut myself in little pieces for her, I would, any day. A real lady, that's what I call her."" Such was Katherine's departure from St. Mary Mead."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,1,"""Well,"" said Lady Tamplin, ""well."" She laid down the continental _Daily Mail_ and stared out across the blue waters of the Mediterranean. A branch of golden mimosa, hanging just above her head, made an effective frame for a very charming picture. A golden-haired, blue-eyed lady in a very becoming negligee. That the golden hair owed something to art, as did the pink-and-white complexion, was undeniable, but the blue of the eyes was Nature's gift, and at forty-four Lady Tamplin could still rank as a beauty. Charming as she looked, Lady Tamplin was, for once, not thinking of herself. That is to say, she was not thinking of her appearance. She was intent on graver matters. Lady Tamplin was a well-known figure on the Riviera, and her parties at the Villa Marguerite were justly celebrated. She was a woman of considerable experience, and had had four husbands. The first had been merely an indiscretion, and so was seldom referred to by the lady. He had had the good sense to die with commendable promptitude, and his widow thereupon espoused a rich manufacturer of buttons. He too had departed for another sphere after three years of married life--it was said after a congenial evening with some boon companions. After him came Viscount Tamplin, who had placed Rosalie securely on those heights where"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,2,"she wished to tread. She had retained her title when she married for a fourth time. This fourth venture had been undertaken for pure pleasure. Mr. Charles Evans, an extremely good-looking young man of twenty-seven, with delightful manners, a keen love of sport, and an appreciation of this world's goods, had no money of his own whatsoever. Lady Tamplin was very pleased and satisfied with life generally, but she had occasional faint preoccupations about money. The button manufacturer had left his widow a considerable fortune, but, as Lady Tamplin was wont to say, ""what with one thing and another--"" (one thing being the depreciation of stocks owing to the War, and the other the extravagances of the late Lord Tamplin). She was still comfortably off. But to be merely comfortably off is hardly satisfactory to one of Rosalie Tamplin's temperament. So, on this particular January morning, she opened her blue eyes extremely wide as she read a certain item of news and uttered that non-committal monosyllable ""Well."" The only other occupant of the balcony was her daughter, the Hon. Lenox Tamplin. A daughter such as Lenox was a sad thorn in Lady Tamplin's side, a girl with no kind of tact, who actually looked older than her age, and whose peculiar sardonic form of humour was, to say the least"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,3,"of it, uncomfortable. ""Darling,"" said Lady Tamplin, ""just fancy."" ""What is it?"" Lady Tamplin picked up the _Daily Mail_, handed it to her daughter, and indicated with an agitated fore finger the paragraph of interest. Lenox read it without any of the signs of agitation shown by her mother. She handed back the paper. ""What about it?"" she asked. ""It is the sort of thing that is always happening. Cheese-paring old women are always dying in villages and leaving fortunes of millions to their humble companions."" ""Yes, dear, I know,"" said her mother, ""and I dare say the fortune is not anything like as large as they say it is; newspapers are so inaccurate. But even if you cut it down by half--"" ""Well,"" said Lenox, ""it has not been left to us."" ""Not exactly, dear,"" said Lady Tamplin; ""but this girl, this Katherine Grey, is actually a cousin of mine. One of the Worcestershire Greys, the Edgeworth lot. My very own cousin! Fancy!"" ""Ah-ha,"" said Lenox. ""And I was wondering--"" said her mother. ""What there was in it for us,"" finished Lenox, with that sideways smile that her mother always found difficult to understand. ""Oh, darling,"" said Lady Tamplin, on a faint note of reproach. It was very faint, because Rosalie Tamplin was used to her daughter's outspokenness and"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,4,"to what she called Lenox's uncomfortable way of putting things. ""I was wondering,"" said Lady Tamplin, again drawing her artistically pencilled brows together, ""whether--oh, good morning, Chubby darling; are you going to play tennis? How nice!"" Chubby, thus addressed, smiled kindly at her, remarked perfunctorily, ""How topping you look in that peach-coloured thing,"" and drifted past them and down the steps. ""The dear thing,"" said Lady Tamplin, looking affectionately after her husband. ""Let me see, what was I saying? Ah!"" She switched her mind back to business once more. ""I was wondering--"" ""Oh, for God's sake get on with it. That is the third time you have said that."" ""Well, dear,"" said Lady Tamplin, ""I was thinking that it would be very nice if I wrote to dear Katherine and suggested that she should pay us a little visit out here. Naturally, she is quite out of touch with Society. It would be nicer for her to be launched by one of her own people. An advantage for her and an advantage for us."" ""How much do you think you would get her to cough up?"" asked Lenox. Her mother looked at her reproachfully and murmured: ""We should have to come to some financial arrangement, of course. What with one thing and another--the War--your poor father--"" ""And Chubby now,"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,5,"said Lenox. ""He is an expensive luxury if you like."" ""She was a nice girl as I remember her,"" murmured Lady Tamplin, pursuing her own line of thought--""quiet, never wanted to shove herself forward, not a beauty, and never a man-hunter."" ""She will leave Chubby alone, then?"" said Lenox. Lady Tamplin looked at her in protest. ""Chubby would never--"" she began. ""No,"" said Lenox, ""I don't believe he would; he knows a jolly sight too well which way his bread is buttered."" ""Darling,"" said Lady Tamplin, ""you have such a coarse way of putting things."" ""Sorry,"" said Lenox. Lady Tamplin gathered up the _Daily Mail_ and her negligee, a vanity-bag, and various odd letters. ""I shall write to dear Katherine at once,"" she said, ""and remind her of the dear old days at Edgeworth."" She went into the house, a light of purpose shining in her eyes. Unlike Mrs. Samuel Harfield, correspondence flowed easily from her pen. She covered four sheets without pause or effort, and on re-reading it found no occasion to alter a word. Katherine received it on the morning of her arrival in London. Whether she read between the lines of it or not is another matter. She put it in her handbag and started out to keep the appointment she had made with Mrs. Harfield's"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,6,"lawyers. The firm was an old-established one in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and after a few minutes' delay Katherine was shown into the presence of the senior partner, a kindly, elderly man with shrewd blue eyes and a fatherly manner. They discussed Mrs. Harfield's will and various legal matters for some minutes, then Katherine handed the lawyer Mrs. Samuel's letter. ""I had better show you this, I suppose,"" she said, ""though it is really rather ridiculous."" He read it with a slight smile. ""Rather a crude attempt, Miss Grey. I need hardly tell you, I suppose, that these people have no claim of any kind upon the estate, and if they endeavour to contest the will no court will uphold them."" ""I thought as much."" ""Human nature is not always very wise. In Mrs. Samuel Harfield's place, I should have been more inclined to make an appeal to your generosity."" ""That is one of the things I wanted to speak to you about. I should like a certain sum to go to these people."" ""There is no obligation."" ""I know that."" ""And they will not take it in the spirit it is meant. They will probably regard it as an attempt to pay them off, though they will not refuse it on that account."" ""I can see that, and it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,7,"can't be helped."" ""I should advise you, Miss Grey, to put that idea out of your head."" Katherine shook her head. ""You are quite right, I know, but I should like it done all the same."" ""They will grab at the money and abuse you all the more afterwards."" ""Well,"" said Katherine, ""let them if they like. We all have our own ways of enjoying ourselves. They were, after all, Mrs. Harfield's only relatives, and though they despised her as a poor relation and paid no attention to her when she was alive, it seems to me unfair that they should be cut off with nothing."" She carried her point, though the lawyer was still unwilling, and she presently went out into the streets of London with a comfortable assurance that she could spend money freely and make what plans she liked for the future. Her first action was to visit the establishment of a famous dressmaker. A slim, elderly Frenchwoman, rather like a dreaming duchess, received her, and Katherine spoke with a certain _naïveté_. ""I want, if I may, to put myself in your hands. I have been very poor all my life and know nothing about clothes, but now I have come into some money and want to look really well dressed."" The Frenchwoman was charmed. She"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,8,"had an artist's temperament, which had been soured earlier in the morning by a visit from an Argentine meat queen, who had insisted on having those models least suited to her flamboyant type of beauty. She scrutinized Katherine with keen, clever eyes. ""Yes--yes, it will be a pleasure. Mademoiselle has a very good figure; for her the simple lines will be best. She is also _très anglaise_. Some people it would offend them if I said that, but Mademoiselle, no. _Une belle Anglaise_, there is no style more delightful."" The demeanour of a dreaming duchess was suddenly put off. She screamed out directions to various mannequins. ""Clothilde, Virginie, quickly, my little ones, the little _tailleur gris clair_ and the _robe de soirée_ '_soupir d'automne_.' Marcelle, my child, the little mimosa suit of crêpe de chine."" It was a charming morning. Marcelle, Clothilde, Virginie, bored and scornful, passed slowly round, squirming and wriggling in the time-honoured fashion of mannequins. The Duchess stood by Katherine and made entries in a small notebook. ""An excellent choice, Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle has great _goût_. Yes, indeed. Mademoiselle cannot do better than those little suits if she is going to the Riviera, as I suppose, this winter."" ""Let me see that evening dress once more,"" said Katherine--""the pinky mauve one."" Virginie appeared, circling slowly. ""That is"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,9,"the prettiest of all,"" said Katherine, as she surveyed the exquisite draperies of mauve and grey and blue. ""What do you call it?"" ""_Soupir d'automne_; yes, yes, that is truly the dress of Mademoiselle."" What was there in these words that came back to Katherine with a faint feeling of sadness after she had left the dressmaking establishment? ""'_Soupir d'automne; that is truly the dress of Mademoiselle._'"" Autumn, yes, it was autumn for her. She who had never known spring or summer, and would never know them now. Something she had lost never could be given to her again. These years of servitude in St. Mary Mead--and all the while life passing by. ""I am an idiot,"" said Katherine. ""I am an idiot. What do I want? Why, I was more contented a month ago than I am now."" She drew out from her handbag the letter she had received that morning from Lady Tamplin. Katherine was no fool. She understood the _nuances_ of that letter as well as anybody and the reason of Lady Tamplin's sudden show of affection towards a long-forgotten cousin was not lost upon her. It was for profit and not for pleasure that Lady Tamplin was so anxious for the company of her dear cousin. Well, why not? There would be profit on both"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,8,8. Lady Tamplin Writes a Letter,10,"sides. ""I will go,"" said Katherine. She was walking down Piccadilly at the moment, and turned into Cook's to clinch the matter then and there. She had to wait for a few minutes. The man with whom the clerk was engaged was also going to the Riviera. Every one, she felt, was going. Well, for the first time in her life, she, too, would be doing what ""everybody did."" The man in front of her turned abruptly, and she stepped into his place. She made her demand to the clerk, but at the same time half of her mind was busy with something else. That man's face--in some vague way it was familiar to her. Where had she seen him before? Suddenly she remembered. It was in the Savoy outside her room that morning. She had collided with him in the passage. Rather an odd coincidence that she should run into him twice in a day. She glanced over her shoulder, rendered uneasy by something, she knew not what. The man was standing in the doorway looking back at her. A cold shiver passed over Katherine; she had a haunting sense of tragedy, of doom impending.... Then she shook the impression from her with her usual good sense and turned her whole attention to what the clerk was saying."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,1,"It was rarely that Derek Kettering allowed his temper to get the better of him. An easy-going insouciance was his chief characteristic, and it had stood him in good stead in more than one tight corner. Even now, by the time he had left Mirelle's flat, he had cooled down. He had need of coolness. The corner he was in now was a tighter one than he had ever been in before, and unforeseen factors had arisen with which, for the moment, he did not know how to deal. He strolled along deep in thought. His brow was furrowed, and there was none of the easy, jaunty manner which sat so well upon him. Various possibilities floated through his mind. It might have been said of Derek Kettering that he was less of a fool than he looked. He saw several roads that he might take--one in particular. If he shrank from it, it was for the moment only."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,2,"Desperate ills need desperate remedies. He had gauged his father-in-law correctly. A war between Derek Kettering and Rufus Van Aldin could end only one way. Derek damned money and the power of money vehemently to himself. He walked up St. James's Street, across Piccadilly, and strolled along it in the direction of Piccadilly Circus. As he passed the offices of Messrs. Thomas Cook & Sons his footsteps slackened. He walked on, however, still turning the matter over in his mind. Finally, he gave a brief nod of his head, turned sharply--so sharply as to collide with a couple of pedestrians who were following in his footsteps, and went back the way he had come. This time he did not pass Cook's, but went in. The office was comparatively empty, and he got attended to at once. ""I want to go to Nice next week. Will you give me particulars?"" ""What date, sir?"" ""The 14th. What is the best train?"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,3,"""Well, of course, _the_ best train is what they call the 'Blue Train.' You avoid the tiresome Customs business at Calais."" Derek nodded. He knew all this, none better. ""The 14th,"" murmured the clerk; ""that is rather soon. The Blue Train is nearly always all booked up."" ""See if there is a berth left,"" said Derek. ""If there is not--"" He left the sentence unfinished, with a curious smile on his face. The clerk disappeared for a few minutes, and presently returned. ""That is all right, sir; still three berths left. I will book you one of them. What name?"" ""Pavett,"" said Derek. He gave the address of his rooms in Jermyn Street. The clerk nodded, finished writing it down, wished Derek good morning politely, and turned his attention to the next client. ""I want to go to Nice--on the 14th. Isn't there a train called the Blue Train?"" Derek looked round sharply. Coincidence--a strange coincidence. He remembered his"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,4,"own half-whimsical words to Mirelle, ""_Portrait of a lady with grey eyes. I don't suppose I shall ever see her again._"" But he _had_ seen her again, and, what was more, she proposed to travel to the Riviera on the same day as he did. Just for a moment a shiver passed over him; in some ways he was superstitious. He had said, half-laughingly, that this woman might bring him bad luck. Suppose--suppose that should prove to be true. From the doorway he looked back at her as she stood talking to the clerk. For once his memory had not played him false. A lady--a lady in every sense of the word. Not very young, not singularly beautiful. But with something--grey eyes that might perhaps see too much. He knew as he went out of the door that in some way he was afraid of this woman. He had a sense of fatality. He went back to his rooms"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,5,"in Jermyn Street and summoned his man. ""Take this cheque, Pavett, cash it first thing in the morning, and go around to Cook's in Piccadilly. They will have some tickets there booked in your name, pay for them, and bring them back."" ""Very good, sir."" Pavett withdrew. Derek strolled over to a side-table and picked up a handful of letters. They were of a type only too familiar. Bills, small bills and large bills, one and all pressing for payment. The tone of the demands was still polite. Derek knew how soon that polite tone would change if--if certain news became public property. He flung himself moodily into a large, leather-covered chair. A damned hole--that was what he was in. Yes, a damned hole! And ways of getting out of that damned hole were not too promising. Pavett appeared with a discreet cough. ""A gentleman to see you--sir--Major Knighton."" ""Knighton, eh?"" Derek sat up, frowned, became suddenly alert. He"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,6,"said in a softer tone, almost to himself: ""Knighton--I wonder what is in the wind now?"" ""Shall I--er--show him in, sir?"" His master nodded. When Knighton entered the room he found a charming and genial host awaiting him. ""Very good of you to look me up,"" said Derek. Knighton was nervous. The other's keen eyes noticed that at once. The errand on which the secretary had come was clearly distasteful to him. He replied almost mechanically to Derek's easy flow of conversation. He declined a drink, and, if anything, his manner became stiffer than before. Derek appeared at last to notice it. ""Well,"" he said cheerfully, ""what does my esteemed father-in-law want with me? You have come on his business, I take it?"" Knighton did not smile in reply. ""I have, yes,"" he said carefully. ""I--I wish Mr. Van Aldin had chosen some one else."" Derek raised his eyebrows in mock dismay. ""Is it as bad as all that?"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,7,"I am not very thin skinned, I can assure you, Knighton."" ""No,"" said Knighton; ""but this--"" He paused. Derek eyed him keenly. ""Go on, out with it,"" he said kindly. ""I can imagine my dear father-in-law's errands might not always be pleasant ones."" Knighton cleared his throat. He spoke formally in tones that he strove to render free of embarrassment. ""I am directed by Mr. Van Aldin to make you a definite offer."" ""An offer?"" For a moment Derek showed his surprise. Knighton's opening words were clearly not what he had expected. He offered a cigarette to Knighton, lit one himself, and sank back in his chair, murmuring in a slightly sardonic voice: ""An offer? That sounds rather interesting."" ""Shall I go on?"" ""Please. You must forgive my surprise, but it seems to me that my dear father-in-law has rather climbed down since our chat this morning. And climbing down is not what one associates with strong men,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,8,"Napoleons of finance, etc. It shows--I think it shows that he finds his position weaker than he thought it."" Knighton listened politely to the easy, mocking voice, but no sign of any kind showed itself on his rather stolid countenance. He waited until Derek had finished, and then he said quietly: ""I will state the proposition in the fewest possible words."" ""Go on."" Knighton did not look at the other. His voice was curt and matter-of-fact. ""The matter is simply this. Mrs. Kettering, as you know, is about to file a petition for divorce. If the case goes undefended you will receive one hundred thousand on the day that the decree is made absolute."" Derek, in the act of lighting his cigarette, suddenly stopped dead. ""A hundred thousand!"" he said sharply. ""Dollars?"" ""Pounds."" There was dead silence for at least two minutes. Kettering had his brows together thinking. A hundred thousand pounds. It meant Mirelle and a continuance"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,9,"of his pleasant, carefree life. It meant that Van Aldin knew something. Van Aldin did not pay for nothing. He got up and stood by the chimney-piece. ""And in the event of my refusing his handsome offer?"" he asked, with a cold, ironical politeness. Knighton made a deprecating gesture. ""I can assure you, Mr. Kettering,"" he said earnestly, ""that it is with the utmost unwillingness that I came here with this message."" ""That's all right,"" said Kettering. ""Don't distress yourself; it's not your fault. Now then--I asked you a question, will you answer it?"" Knighton also rose. He spoke more reluctantly than before. ""In the event of your refusing this proposition,"" he said, ""Mr. Van Aldin wished me to tell you in plain words that he proposes to break you. Just that."" Kettering raised his eyebrows, but he retained his light, amused manner. ""Well, well!"" he said, ""I suppose he can do it. I certainly should not be"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,9,9. An Offer Refused,10,"able to put up much of a fight against America's man of millions. A hundred thousand! If you are going to bribe a man there is nothing like doing it thoroughly. Supposing I were to tell you that for two hundred thousand I'd do what he wanted, what then?"" ""I would take your message back to Mr. Van Aldin,"" said Knighton unemotionally. ""Is that your answer?"" ""No,"" said Derek; ""funnily enough it is not. You can go back to my father-in-law and tell him to take himself and his bribes to hell. Is that clear?"" ""Perfectly,"" said Knighton. He got up, hesitated, and then flushed. ""I--you will allow me to say, Mr. Kettering, that I am glad you have answered as you have."" Derek did not reply. When the other had left the room he remained for a minute or two lost in thought. A curious smile came to his lips. ""And that is that,"" he said softly."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,1,"""Dad!"" Mrs. Kettering started violently. Her nerves were not completely under control this morning. Very perfectly dressed in a long mink coat and a little hat of Chinese lacquer red, she had been walking along the crowded platform of Victoria deep in thought, and her father's sudden appearance and hearty greeting had an unlooked-for effect upon her. ""Why, Ruth, how you jumped!"" ""I didn't expect to see you, I suppose, Dad. You said good-bye to me last night and said you had a conference this morning."" ""So I have,"" said Van Aldin, ""but you are more to me than any number of darned conferences. I came to take a last look at you, since I am not going to see you for some time."" ""That is very sweet of you, Dad. I wish you were coming too."" ""What would you say if I did?"" The remark was merely a joking one. He was surprised to see the quick colour flame in Ruth's cheeks. For a moment he almost thought he saw dismay flash out of her eyes. She laughed uncertainly and nervously. ""Just for a moment I really thought you meant it,"" she said. ""Would you have been pleased?"" ""Of course."" She spoke with exaggerated emphasis. ""Well,"" said Van Aldin, ""that's good."" ""It isn't really for very long, Dad,"" continued Ruth; ""you know, you are coming out next month."" ""Ah!"" said Van Aldin unemotionally, ""sometimes I guess I will go to one of these big guys in Harley Street and have him tell me that I need sunshine and change of air right away."" ""Don't be so lazy,"" cried Ruth; ""next month is ever so much nicer than this month out there. You have got all sorts of things you can't possibly leave just now."" ""Well, that's so, I suppose,"" said Van Aldin, with a sigh. ""You had better be getting on board this train of yours, Ruth. Where is your seat?"" Ruth Kettering looked vaguely up at the train. At the door of one of the Pullman cars a thin, tall woman dressed"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,2,"in black was standing--Ruth Kettering's maid. She drew aside as her mistress came up to her. ""I have put your dressing-case under your seat, Madam, in case you should need it. Shall I take the rugs, or will you require one?"" ""No, no, I shan't want one. Better go and find your own seat now, Mason."" ""Yes, Madam."" The maid departed. Van Aldin entered the Pullman car with Ruth. She found her seat, and Van Aldin deposited various papers and magazines on the table in front of her. The seat opposite to her was already taken, and the American gave a cursory glance at its occupant. He had a fleeting impression of attractive grey eyes and a neat travelling costume. He indulged in a little more desultory conversation with Ruth, the kind of talk peculiar to those seeing other people off by train. Presently, as whistles blew, he glanced at his watch. ""I had best be clearing out of here. Good-bye, my dear. Don't worry, I will attend to things."" ""Oh, father!"" He turned back sharply. There had been something in Ruth's voice, something so entirely foreign to her usual manner, that he was startled. It was almost a cry of despair. She had made an impulsive movement towards him, but in another minute she was mistress of herself once more. ""Till next month,"" she said cheerfully. Two minutes later the train started. Ruth sat very still, biting her under lip and trying hard to keep the unaccustomed tears from her eyes. She felt a sudden sense of horrible desolation. There was a wild longing upon her to jump out of the train and to go back before it was too late. She, so calm, so self-assured, for the first time in her life felt like a leaf swept by the wind. If her father knew--what would he say? Madness! Yes, just that, madness! For the first time in her life she was swept away by emotion, swept away to the point of doing a thing which even she knew to be incredibly foolish"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,3,"and reckless. She was enough Van Aldin's daughter to realize her own folly, and level headed enough to condemn her own action. But she was his daughter in another sense also. She had that same iron determination that would have what it wanted, and once it had made up its mind would not be balked. From her cradle she had been self-willed; the very circumstances of her life had developed that self-will in her. It drove her now remorselessly. Well, the die was cast. She must go through with it now. She looked up, and her eyes met those of the woman sitting opposite. She had a sudden fancy that in some way this other woman had read her mind. She saw in those grey eyes understanding and--yes--compassion. It was only a fleeting impression. The faces of both women hardened to well-bred impassiveness. Mrs. Kettering took up a magazine, and Katherine Grey looked out of the window and watched a seemingly endless vista of depressing streets and suburban houses. Ruth found an increasing difficulty in fixing her mind on the printed page in front of her. In spite of herself, a thousand apprehensions preyed on her mind. What a fool she had been! What a fool she was! Like all cool and self-sufficient people, when she did lose her self-control she lost it thoroughly. It was too late.... Was it too late? Oh, for some one to speak to, for some one to advise her. She had never before had such a wish; she would have scorned the idea of relying on any judgment other than her own, but now--what was the matter with her? Panic. Yes, that would describe it best--panic. She, Ruth Kettering, was completely and utterly panic stricken. She stole a covert glance at the figure opposite. If only she knew some one like that, some nice, cool, calm, sympathetic creature. That was the sort of person one could talk to. But you can't, of course, confide in a stranger. And Ruth smiled to herself a little at the idea. She"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,4,"picked up the magazine again. Really she must control herself. After all, she had thought all this out. She had decided of her own free will. What happiness had she ever had in her life up to now? She said to herself restlessly: ""Why shouldn't I be happy? No one will ever know."" It seemed no time before Dover was reached. Ruth was a good sailor. She disliked the cold, and was glad to reach the shelter of the private cabin she had telegraphed for. Although she would not have admitted the fact, Ruth was in some ways superstitious. She was of the order of people to whom coincidence appeals. After disembarking at Calais and settling herself down with her maid in her double compartment in the Blue Train, she went along to the luncheon car. It was with a little shock of surprise that she found herself set down to a small table with, opposite her, the same woman who had been her _vis-à-vis_ in the Pullman. A faint smile came to the lips of both women. ""This is quite a coincidence,"" said Mrs. Kettering. ""I know,"" said Katherine; ""it is odd the way things happen."" A flying attendant shot up to them with the wonderful velocity always displayed by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits and deposited two cups of soup. By the time the omelette succeeded the soup they were chatting together in friendly fashion. ""It will be heavenly to get into the sunshine,"" sighed Ruth. ""I am sure it will be a wonderful feeling."" ""You know the Riviera well?"" ""No; this is my first visit."" ""Fancy that."" ""You go every year, I expect?"" ""Practically. January and February in London are horrible."" ""I have always lived in the country. They are not very inspiring months there either. Mostly mud."" ""What made you suddenly decide to travel?"" ""Money,"" said Katherine. ""For ten years I have been a paid companion with just enough money of my own to buy myself strong country shoes; now I have been left what seems to me a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,5,"fortune, though I dare say it would not seem so to you."" ""Now I wonder why you say that--that it would not seem so to me."" Katherine laughed. ""I don't really know. I suppose one forms impressions without thinking of it. I put you down in my own mind as one of the very rich of the earth. It was just an impression. I dare say I am wrong."" ""No,"" said Ruth, ""you are not wrong."" She had suddenly become very grave. ""I wish you would tell me what other impressions you formed about me?"" ""I--"" Ruth swept on disregarding the other's embarrassment. ""Oh, please, don't be conventional. I want to know. As we left Victoria I looked across at you, and I had the sort of feeling that you--well, understood what was going on in my mind."" ""I can assure you I am not a mind reader,"" said Katherine, smiling. ""No; but will you tell me, please, just what you thought."" Ruth's eagerness was so intense and so sincere that she carried her point. ""I will tell you if you like, but you must not think me impertinent. I thought that for some reason you were in great distress of mind, and I was sorry for you."" ""You are right. You are quite right. I am in terrible trouble. I--I should like to tell you something about it, if I may."" ""Oh, dear,"" Katherine thought to herself, ""how extraordinarily alike the world seems to be everywhere! People were always telling me things in St. Mary Mead, and it is just the same thing here, and I don't really want to hear anybody's troubles!"" She replied politely: ""Do tell me."" They were just finishing their lunch. Ruth gulped down her coffee, rose from her seat, and quite oblivious of the fact that Katherine had not begun to sip her coffee, said: ""Come to my compartment with me."" They were two single compartments with a communicating door between them. In the second of them a thin maid, whom Katherine had noticed at Victoria, was"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,6,"sitting very upright on the seat, clutching a big scarlet morocco case with the initials R. V. K. on it. Mrs. Kettering pulled the communicating door to and sank down on the seat. Katherine sat down beside her. ""I am in trouble and I don't know what to do. There is a man whom I am fond of--very fond of indeed. We cared for each other when we were young, and we were thrust apart most brutally and unjustly. Now we have come together again."" ""Yes?"" ""I--I am going to meet him now. Oh! I dare say you think it is all wrong, but you don't know the circumstances. My husband is impossible. He has treated me disgracefully."" ""Yes,"" said Katherine again. ""What I feel so badly about is this. I have deceived my father--it was he who came to see me off at Victoria to-day. He wishes me to divorce my husband, and, of course, he has no idea--that I am going to meet this other man. He would think it extraordinarily foolish."" ""Well, don't you think it is?"" ""I--I suppose it is."" Ruth Kettering looked down at her hands; they were shaking violently. ""But I can't draw back now."" ""Why not?"" ""I--it is all arranged, and it would break his heart."" ""Don't you believe it,"" said Katherine robustly; ""hearts are pretty tough."" ""He will think I have no courage, no strength of purpose."" ""It seems to me an awfully silly thing that you are going to do,"" said Katherine. ""I think you realize that yourself."" Ruth Kettering buried her face in her hands. ""I don't know--I don't know. Ever since I left Victoria I have had a horrible feeling of something--something that is coming to me very soon--that I can't escape."" She clutched convulsively at Katherine's hand. ""You must think I am mad talking to you like this, but I tell you I know something horrible is going to happen."" ""Don't think it,"" said Katherine; ""try to pull yourself together. You could send your father a wire from Paris, if you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,7,"like, and he would come to you at once."" The other brightened. ""Yes, I could do that. Dear old Dad. It is queer--but I never knew until to-day how terribly fond of him I am."" She sat up and dried her eyes with a handkerchief. ""I have been very foolish. Thank you so much for letting me talk to you. I don't know why I got into such a queer, hysterical state."" She got up. ""I am quite all right now. I suppose, really, I just needed some one to talk to. I can't think now why I have been making such an absolute fool of myself."" Katherine got up too. ""I am so glad you feel better,"" she said, trying to make her voice sound as conventional as possible. She was only too well aware that the aftermath of confidences is embarrassment. She added tactfully: ""I must be going back to my own compartment."" She emerged into the corridor at the same time as the maid was also coming out from the next door. The latter looked towards Katherine, over her shoulder, and an expression of intense surprise showed itself on her face. Katherine turned also, but by that time whoever it was who had aroused the maid's interest had retreated into his or her compartment, and the corridor was empty. Katherine walked down it to regain her own place, which was in the next coach. As she passed the end compartment the door opened and a woman's face looked out for a moment and then pulled the door to sharply. It was a face not easily forgotten, as Katherine was to know when she saw it again. A beautiful face, oval and dark, very heavily made up in a bizarre fashion. Katherine had a feeling that she had seen it before somewhere. She regained her own compartment without other adventure and sat for some time thinking of the confidence which had just been made to her. She wondered idly who the woman in the mink coat might be, wondered also how"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,8,"the end of her story would turn out. ""If I have stopped any one from making an idiot of themselves, I suppose I have done good work,"" she thought to herself. ""But who knows? That is the kind of woman who is hard-headed and egotistical all her life, and it might be good for her to do the other sort of thing for a change. Oh, well--I don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She certainly won't want to see _me_ again. That is the worst of letting people tell you things. They never do."" She hoped that she would not be given the same place at dinner. She reflected, not without humour, that it might be awkward for both of them. Leaning back with her head against a cushion she felt tired and vaguely depressed. They had reached Paris, and the slow journey round the _ceinture_, with its interminable stops and waits, was very wearisome. When they arrived at the Gare de Lyon she was glad to get out and walk up and down the platform. The keen cold air was refreshing after the steam-heated train. She observed with a smile that her friend of the mink coat was solving the possible awkwardness of the dinner problem in her own way. A dinner basket was being handed up and received through the window by the maid. When the train started once more, and dinner was announced by a violent ringing of bells, Katherine went along to it much relieved in mind. Her _vis-à-vis_ to-night was of an entirely different kind--a small man, distinctly foreign in appearance, with a rigidly waxed moustache and an egg-shaped head which he carried rather on one side. Katherine had taken in a book to dinner with her. She found the little man's eyes fixed upon it with a kind of twinkling amusement. ""I see, Madame, that you have a _roman policier_. You are fond of such things?"" ""They amuse me,"" Katherine admitted. The little man nodded with the air of complete understanding. ""They have a good"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,9,"sale always, so I am told. Now why is that, eh, Mademoiselle? I ask it of you as a student of human nature--why should that be?"" Katherine felt more and more amused. ""Perhaps they give one the illusion of living an exciting life,"" she suggested. He nodded gravely. ""Yes; there is something in that."" ""Of course, one knows that such things don't really happen,"" Katherine was continuing, but he interrupted her sharply. ""Sometimes, Mademoiselle! Sometimes! I who speak to you--they have happened to _me_."" She threw him a quick, interested glance. ""Some day, who knows, _you_ might be in the thick of things,"" he went on. ""It is all chance."" ""I don't think it is likely,"" said Katherine. ""Nothing of that kind ever happens to me."" He leaned forward. ""Would you like it to?"" The question startled her, and she drew in her breath sharply. ""It is my fancy, perhaps,"" said the little man, as he dexterously polished one of the forks, ""but I think that you have a yearning in you for interesting happenings. _Eh bien_, Mademoiselle, all through my life I have observed one thing--'All one wants one gets!' Who knows?"" His face screwed itself up comically. ""You may get more than you bargain for."" ""Is that a prophecy?"" asked Katherine, smiling as she rose from the table. The little man shook his head. ""I never prophesy,"" he declared pompously. ""It is true that I have the habit of being always right--but I do not boast of it. Good-night, Mademoiselle, and may you sleep well."" Katherine went back along the train amused and entertained by her little neighbour. She passed the open door of her friend's compartment and saw the conductor making up the bed. The lady in the mink coat was standing looking out of the window. The second compartment, as Katherine saw through the communicating door, was empty, with rugs and bags heaped up on the seat. The maid was not there. Katherine found her own bed prepared, and since she was tired, she went to bed and switched"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,10,10. On the Blue Train,10,"off her light about half-past nine. She woke with a sudden start; how much time had passed she did not know. Glancing at her watch, she found that it had stopped. A feeling of intense uneasiness pervaded her and grew stronger moment by moment. At last she got up, threw her dressing-gown round her shoulders, and stepped out into the corridor. The whole train seemed wrapped in slumber. Katherine let down the window and sat by it for some minutes, drinking in the cool night air and trying vainly to calm her uneasy fears. She presently decided that she would go along to the end and ask the conductor for the right time so that she could set her watch. She found, however, that his little chair was vacant. She hesitated for a moment and then walked through into the next coach. She looked down the long, dim line of the corridor and saw, to her surprise, that a man was standing with his hand on the door of the compartment occupied by the lady in the mink coat. That is to say, she thought it was the compartment. Probably, however, she was mistaken. He stood there for a moment or two with his back to her, seeming uncertain and hesitating in his attitude. Then he slowly turned, and with an odd feeling of fatality, Katherine recognized him as the same man whom she had noticed twice before--once in the corridor of the Savoy hotel and once in Cook's offices. Then he opened the door of the compartment and passed in, drawing it to behind him. An idea flashed across Katherine's mind. Could this be the man of whom the other woman had spoken--the man she was journeying to meet. Then Katherine told herself that she was romancing. In all probability she had mistaken the compartment. She went back to her own carriage. Five minutes later the train slackened speed. There was the long plaintive hiss of the Westinghouse brake, and a few minutes later the train came to a stop at Lyons."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,1,"Katherine wakened the next morning to brilliant sunshine. She went along to breakfast early, but met none of her acquaintances of the day before. When she returned to her compartment it had just been restored to its day-time appearance by the conductor, a dark man with a drooping moustache and melancholy face. ""Madame is fortunate,"" he said; ""the sun shines. It is always a great disappointment to passengers when they arrive on a grey morning."" ""I should have been disappointed, certainly,"" said Katherine. The man prepared to depart. ""We are rather late, Madame,"" he said. ""I will let you know just before we get to Nice."" Katherine nodded. She sat by the window, entranced by the sunlit panorama. The palm trees, the deep blue of the sea, the bright yellow mimosa came with all the charm of novelty to the woman who for fourteen years had known only the drab winters of England. When they arrived at Cannes, Katherine got out and walked up and down the platform. She was curious about the lady in the mink coat, and looked up at the windows of her compartment. The blinds were still drawn down--the only ones to be so on the whole train. Katherine wondered a little, and when she re-entered the train she passed along the corridor and noticed that these two compartments were still shuttered and closed. The lady of the mink coat was clearly no early riser. Presently the conductor came to her and told her that in a few minutes the train would arrive at Nice. Katherine handed him a tip; the man thanked her, but still lingered. There was something odd about him. Katherine, who had at first wondered whether the tip had not been big enough, was now convinced that something far more serious was amiss. His face was of a sickly pallor, he was shaking all over, and looked as if he had been frightened out of his life. He was eyeing her in a curious manner. Presently he said abruptly:"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,2,"""Madame will excuse me, but is she expecting friends to meet her at Nice?"" ""Probably,"" said Katherine. ""Why?"" But the man merely shook his head and murmured something that Katherine could not catch and moved away, not reappearing until the train came to rest at the station, when he started handing her belongings down from the window. Katherine stood for a moment or two on the platform rather at a loss, but a fair young man with an ingenuous face came up to her and said rather hesitatingly: ""Miss Grey, is it not?"" Katherine said that it was, and the young man beamed upon her seraphically and murmured: ""I am Chubby, you know--Lady Tamplin's husband. I expect she mentioned me, but perhaps she forgot. Have you got your _billet de bagages_? I lost mine when I came out this year, and you would not believe the fuss they made about it. Regular French red tape!"" Katherine produced it, and was just about to move off beside him when a very gentle and insidious voice murmured in her ear: ""A little moment, Madame, if you please."" Katherine turned to behold an individual who made up for insignificance of stature by a large quantity of gold lace and uniform. The individual explained. ""There were certain formalities. Madame would perhaps be so kind as to accompany him. The regulations of the police--"" He threw up his arms. ""Absurd, doubtless, but there it was."" Mr. Chubby Evans listened with a very imperfect comprehension, his French being of a limited order. ""So like the French,"" murmured Mr. Evans. He was one of those staunch patriotic Britons who, having made a portion of a foreign country their own, strongly resent the original inhabitants of it. ""Always up to some silly dodge or other. They've never tackled people on the station before, though. This is something quite new. I suppose you'll have to go."" Katherine departed with her guide. Somewhat to her surprise, he led her towards a siding where a coach of the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,3,"departed train had been shunted. He invited her to mount into this, and, preceding her down the corridor, held aside the door of one of the compartments. In it was a pompous-looking official personage, and with him a nondescript being who appeared to be a clerk. The pompous-looking personage rose politely, bowed to Katherine, and said: ""You will excuse me, Madame, but there are certain formalities to be complied with. Madame speaks French, I trust?"" ""Sufficiently, I think, Monsieur,"" replied Katherine in that language. ""That is good. Pray be seated, Madame. I am M. Caux, the Commissary of Police."" He blew out his chest importantly, and Katherine tried to look sufficiently impressed. ""You wish to see my passport?"" she inquired. ""Here it is."" The Commissary eyed her keenly and gave a little grunt. ""Thank you, Madame,"" he said, taking the passport from her. He cleared his throat. ""But what I really desire is a little information."" ""Information?"" The Commissary nodded his head slowly. ""About a lady who has been a fellow-passenger of yours. You lunched with her yesterday."" ""I am afraid I can't tell you anything about her. We fell into conversation over our meal, but she is a complete stranger to me. I have never seen her before."" ""And yet,"" said the Commissary sharply, ""you returned to her compartment with her after lunch and sat talking for some time?"" ""Yes,"" said Katherine; ""that is true."" The Commissary seemed to expect her to say something more. He looked at her encouragingly. ""Yes, Madame?"" ""Well, Monsieur?"" said Katherine. ""You can, perhaps, give me some kind of idea of that conversation?"" ""I could,"" said Katherine, ""but at the moment I see no reason to do so."" In somewhat British fashion she felt annoyed. This foreign official seemed to her impertinent. ""No reason?"" cried the Commissary. ""Oh yes, Madame, I can assure you that there _is_ a reason."" ""Then perhaps you will give it to me."" The Commissary rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a minute or two without speaking. ""Madame,"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,4,"he said at last, ""the reason is very simple. The lady in question was found dead in her compartment this morning."" ""Dead!"" gasped Katherine. ""What was it--heart failure?"" ""No,"" said the Commissary in a reflective, dreamy voice. ""No--she was murdered."" ""Murdered!"" cried Katherine. ""So you see, Madame, why we are anxious for any information we can possibly get."" ""But surely her maid--"" ""The maid has disappeared."" ""Oh!"" Katherine paused to assemble her thoughts. ""Since the conductor had seen you talking with her in her compartment, he quite naturally reported the fact to the police, and that is why, Madame, we have detained you, in the hope of gaining some information."" ""I am very sorry,"" said Katherine; ""I don't even know her name."" ""Her name is Kettering. That we know from her passport and from the labels on her luggage. If we--"" There was a knock on the compartment door. M. Caux frowned. He opened it about six inches. ""What is the matter?"" he said peremptorily. ""I cannot be disturbed."" The egg-shaped head of Katherine's dinner acquaintance showed itself in the aperture. On his face was a beaming smile. ""My name,"" he said, ""is Hercule Poirot."" ""Not,"" the Commissary stammered, ""not _the_ Hercule Poirot?"" ""The same,"" said M. Poirot. ""I remember meeting you once, M. Caux, at the _Sûreté_ in Paris, though doubtless you have forgotten me?"" ""Not at all, Monsieur, not at all,"" declared the Commissary heartily. ""But enter, I pray of you. You know of this--"" ""Yes, I know,"" said Hercule Poirot. ""I came to see if I might be of any assistance?"" ""We should be flattered,"" replied the Commissary promptly. ""Let me present you, M. Poirot, to""--he consulted the passport he still held in his hand--""to Madame--er--Mademoiselle Grey."" Poirot smiled across at Katherine. ""It is strange, is it not,"" he murmured, ""that my words should have come true so quickly?"" ""Mademoiselle, alas! can tell us very little,"" said the Commissary. ""I have been explaining,"" said Katherine, ""that this poor lady was a complete stranger to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,5,"me."" Poirot nodded. ""But she talked to you, did she not?"" he said gently. ""You formed an impression--is it not so?"" ""Yes,"" said Katherine thoughtfully. ""I suppose I did."" ""And that impression was--"" ""Yes, Mademoiselle""--the Commissary jerked himself forward--""let us by all means have your impressions."" Katherine sat turning the whole thing over in her mind. She felt in a way as if she were betraying a confidence, but with that ugly word ""Murder"" ringing in her ears she dared not keep anything back. Too much might hang upon it. So, as nearly as she could, she repeated word for word the conversation she had had with the dead woman. ""That is interesting,"" said the Commissary, glancing at the other. ""Eh, M. Poirot, that is interesting? Whether it has anything to do with the crime--"" He left the sentence unfinished. ""I suppose it could not be suicide,"" said Katherine, rather doubtfully. ""No,"" said the Commissary, ""it could not be suicide. She was strangled with a length of black cord."" ""Oh!"" Katherine shivered. M. Caux spread out his hands apologetically. ""It is not nice--no. I think that our train robbers are more brutal than they are in your country."" ""It is horrible."" ""Yes, yes""--he was soothing and apologetic--""but you have great courage, Mademoiselle. At once, as soon as I saw you, I said to myself, 'Mademoiselle has great courage.' That is why I am going to ask you to do something more--something distressing, but I assure you very necessary."" Katherine looked at him apprehensively. He spread out his hands apologetically. ""I am going to ask you, Mademoiselle, to be so good as to accompany me to the next compartment."" ""Must I?"" asked Katherine in a low voice. ""Some one must identify her,"" said the Commissary, ""and since the maid has disappeared""--he coughed significantly--""you appear to be the person who has seen most of her since she joined the train."" ""Very well,"" said Katherine quietly; ""if it is necessary--"" She rose. Poirot gave her a little nod of approval."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,6,"""Mademoiselle is sensible,"" he said. ""May I accompany you, M. Caux?"" ""Enchanted, my dear M. Poirot."" They went out into the corridor, and M. Caux unlocked the door of the dead woman's compartment. The blinds on the far side had been drawn half-way up to admit light. The dead woman lay on the berth to their left, in so natural a posture that one could have thought her asleep. The bedclothes were drawn up over her, and her head was turned to the wall, so that only the red auburn curls showed. Very gently M. Caux laid a hand on her shoulder and turned the body back so that the face came into view. Katherine flinched a little and dug her nails into her palms. A heavy blow had disfigured the features almost beyond recognition. Poirot gave a sharp exclamation. ""When was that done, I wonder?"" he demanded. ""Before death or after?"" ""The doctor says after,"" said M. Caux. ""Strange,"" said Poirot, drawing his brows together. He turned to Katherine. ""Be brave, Mademoiselle; look at her well. Are you sure that this is the woman you talked to in the train yesterday?"" Katherine had good nerves. She steeled herself to look long and earnestly at the recumbent figure. Then she leaned forward and took up the dead woman's hand. ""I am quite sure,"" she replied at length. ""The face is too disfigured to recognize, but the build and carriage and hair are exact, and besides I noticed _this_""--she pointed to a tiny mole on the dead woman's wrist--""while I was talking to her."" ""_Bon_,"" approved Poirot. ""You are an excellent witness, Mademoiselle. There is, then, no question as to the identity, but it is strange, all the same."" He frowned down on the dead woman in perplexity. M. Caux shrugged his shoulders. ""The murderer was carried away by rage, doubtless,"" he suggested. ""If she had been struck down, it would have been comprehensible,"" mused Poirot, ""but the man who strangled her slipped up behind and caught her"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,7,"unawares. A little choke--a little gurgle--that is all that would be heard, and then afterwards--that smashing blow on her face. Now why? Did he hope that if the face were unrecognizable she might not be identified? Or did he hate her so much that he could not resist striking that blow even after she was dead?"" Katherine shuddered, and he turned at once to her kindly. ""You must not let me distress you, Mademoiselle,"" he said. ""To you this is all very new and terrible. To me, alas! it is an old story. One moment, I pray of you both."" They stood against the door watching him as he went quickly round the compartment. He noted the dead woman's clothes neatly folded on the end of the berth, the big fur coat that hung from a hook, and the little red lacquer hat tossed up on the rack. Then he passed through into the adjoining compartment, that in which Katherine had seen the maid sitting. Here the berth had not been made up. Three or four rugs were piled loosely on the seat; there was a hat-box and a couple of suit-cases. He turned suddenly to Katherine. ""You were in here yesterday,"" he said. ""Do you see anything changed, anything missing?"" Katherine looked carefully round both compartments. ""Yes,"" she said, ""there is something missing--a scarlet morocco case. It had the initials 'R. V. K.' on it. It might have been a small dressing-case or a big jewel-case. When I saw it, the maid was holding it."" ""Ah!"" said Poirot. ""But, surely,"" said Katherine. ""I--of course, I don't know anything about such things, but surely it is plain enough, if the maid and the jewel-case are missing?"" ""You mean that it was the maid who was the thief? No, Mademoiselle; there is a very good reason against that."" ""What?"" ""The maid was left behind in Paris."" He turned to Poirot. ""I should like you to hear the conductor's story yourself,"" he murmured confidentially. ""It is very suggestive."" ""Mademoiselle"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,8,"would doubtless like to hear it also,"" said Poirot. ""You do not object, Monsieur le Commissaire?"" ""No,"" said the Commissary, who clearly did object very much. ""No, certainly, M. Poirot, if you say so. You have finished here?"" ""I think so. One little minute."" He had been turning over the rugs, and now he took one to the window and looked at it, picking something off it with his fingers. ""What is it?"" demanded M. Caux sharply. ""Four auburn hairs."" He bent over the dead woman. ""Yes, they are from the head of Madame."" ""And what of it? Do you attach importance to them?"" Poirot let the rug drop back on the seat. ""What is important? What is not? One cannot say at this stage. But we must note each little fact carefully."" They went back again into the first compartment, and in a minute or two the conductor of the carriage arrived to be questioned. ""Your name is Pierre Michel?"" said the Commissary. ""Yes, Monsieur le Commissaire."" ""I should like you to repeat to this gentleman""--he indicated Poirot--""the story that you told me as to what happened in Paris."" ""Very good, Monsieur le Commissaire. It was after we had left the Gare de Lyon. I came along to make the beds, thinking that Madame would be at dinner, but she had a dinner basket in her compartment. She said to me that she had been obliged to leave her maid behind in Paris, so that I need make up only one berth. She took her dinner basket into the adjoining compartment, and sat there while I made up the bed; then she told me that she did not wish to be wakened early in the morning, that she liked to sleep on. I told her I quite understood, and she wished me 'good-night.'"" ""You yourself did not go into the adjoining compartment?"" ""No, Monsieur."" ""Then you did not happen to notice if a scarlet morocco case was amongst the luggage there?"" ""No, Monsieur, I did not."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,9,"""Would it have been possible for a man to have been concealed in the adjoining compartment?"" The conductor reflected. ""The door was half open,"" he said. ""If a man had stood behind that door I should not have been able to see him, but he would, of course, have been perfectly visible to Madame when she went in there."" ""Quite so,"" said Poirot. ""Is there anything more you have to tell us?"" ""I think that is all, Monsieur. I can remember nothing else."" ""And now this morning?"" prompted Poirot. ""As Madame had ordered, I did not disturb her. It was not until just before Cannes that I ventured to knock at the door. Getting no reply, I opened it. The lady appeared to be in her bed asleep. I took her by the shoulder to rouse her, and then--"" ""And then you saw what had happened,"" volunteered Poirot. ""_Très bien._ I think I know all I want to know."" ""I hope, Monsieur le Commissaire, it is not that I have been guilty of any negligence,"" said the man piteously. ""Such an affair to happen on the Blue Train! It is horrible."" ""Console yourself,"" said the Commissary. ""Everything will be done to keep the affair as quiet as possible, if only in the interests of justice. I cannot think you have been guilty of any negligence."" ""And Monsieur le Commissaire will report as much to the Company?"" ""But certainly, but certainly,"" said M. Caux impatiently. ""That will do now."" The conductor withdrew. ""According to the medical evidence,"" said the Commissary, ""the lady was probably dead before the train reached Lyons. Who then was the murderer? From Mademoiselle's story, it seems clear that somewhere on her journey she was to meet this man of whom she spoke. Her action in getting rid of the maid seems significant. Did the man join the train at Paris, and did she conceal him in the adjoining compartment? If so, they may have quarrelled, and he may have killed her in a fit"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,11,11. Murder,10,"of rage. That is one possibility. The other, and the more likely to my mind, is that her assailant was a train robber travelling on the train; that he stole along the corridor unseen by the conductor, killed her, and went off with the red morocco case, which doubtless contained jewels of some value. In all probability he left the train at Lyons, and we have already telegraphed to the station there for full particulars of any one seen leaving the train."" ""Or he might have come on to Nice,"" suggested Poirot. ""He might,"" agreed the Commissary, ""but that would be a very bold course."" Poirot let a minute or two go by before speaking, and then he said: ""In the latter case you think the man was an ordinary train robber?"" The Commissary shrugged his shoulders. ""It depends. We must get hold of the maid. It is possible that she has the red morocco case with her. If so, then the man of whom she spoke to Mademoiselle may be concerned in the case, and the affair is a crime of passion. I myself think the solution of a train robber is the more probable. These bandits have become very bold of late."" Poirot looked suddenly across to Katherine. ""And you, Mademoiselle,"" he said, ""you heard and saw nothing during the night?"" ""Nothing,"" said Katherine. Poirot turned to the Commissary. ""We need detain Mademoiselle no longer, I think,"" he suggested. The latter nodded. ""She will leave us her address?"" he said. Katherine gave him the name of Lady Tamplin's villa. Poirot made her a little bow. ""You permit that I see you again, Mademoiselle?"" he said. ""Or have you so many friends that your time will be all taken up?"" ""On the contrary,"" said Katherine, ""I shall have plenty of leisure, and I shall be very pleased to see you again."" ""Excellent,"" said Poirot, and gave her a little friendly nod. ""This shall be a _'roman policier' à nous_. We will investigate this affair together."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,1,"""Then you were really in the thick of it all!"" said Lady Tamplin enviously. ""My dear, how thrilling!"" She opened her china blue eyes very wide and gave a little sigh. ""A real murder,"" said Mr. Evans gloatingly. ""Of course Chubby had no idea of anything of the kind,"" went on Lady Tamplin; ""he simply could _not_ imagine why the police wanted you. My dear, what an opportunity! I think, you know--yes, I certainly think something might be made out of this."" A calculating look rather marred the ingenuousness of the blue eyes. Katherine felt slightly uncomfortable. They were just finishing lunch, and she looked in turn at the three people sitting round the table. Lady Tamplin, full of practical schemes; Mr. Evans, beaming with naïve appreciation, and Lenox with a queer crooked smile on her dark face. ""Marvellous luck,"" murmured Chubby; ""I wish I could have gone along with you--and seen--all the exhibits."" His tone was wistful and childlike. Katherine said nothing. The police had laid no injunctions of secrecy upon her, and it was clearly impossible to suppress the bare facts or try to keep them from her hostess. But she did rather wish it had been possible to do so. ""Yes,"" said Lady Tamplin, coming suddenly out of her reverie, ""I do think something might be done. A little account,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,2,"you know, cleverly written up. An eye-witness, a feminine touch: '_How I chatted with the dead woman, little thinking_--' that sort of thing, you know."" ""Rot!"" said Lenox. ""You have no idea,"" said Lady Tamplin in a soft, wistful voice, ""what newspapers will pay for a little titbit! Written, of course, by some one of really unimpeachable social position. You would not like to do it yourself, I dare say, Katherine dear, but just give me the bare bones of it, and _I_ will manage the whole thing for you. Mr. de Haviland is a special friend of mine. We have a little understanding together. A most delightful man--not at all reporterish. How does the idea strike you, Katherine?"" ""I would much prefer to do nothing of the kind,"" said Katherine bluntly. Lady Tamplin was rather disconcerted at this uncompromising refusal. She sighed and turned to the elucidation of further details. ""A very striking-looking woman, you said? I wonder now who she could have been. You didn't hear her name?"" ""It was mentioned,"" Katherine admitted, ""but I can't remember it. You see, I was rather upset."" ""I should think so,"" said Mr. Evans; ""it must have been a beastly shock."" It is to be doubted whether, even if Katherine had remembered the name, she would have admitted the fact. Lady Tamplin's remorseless cross-examination"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,3,"was making her restive. Lenox, who was observant in her own way, noticed this, and offered to take Katherine upstairs to see her room. She left her there, remarking kindly before she went: ""You mustn't mind Mother; she would make a few pennies' profit out of her dying grandmother if she could."" Lenox went down again to find her mother and her step-father discussing the newcomer. ""Presentable,"" said Lady Tamplin, ""quite presentable. Her clothes are all right. That grey thing is the same model that Gladys Cooper wore in _Palm Trees in Egypt_."" ""Have you noticed her eyes--what?"" interposed Mr. Evans. ""Never mind her eyes, Chubby,"" said Lady Tamplin tartly; ""we are discussing the things that really matter."" ""Oh, quite,"" said Mr. Evans, and retired into his shell. ""She doesn't seem to me very--malleable,"" said Lady Tamplin, rather hesitating to choose the right word. ""She has all the instincts of a lady, as they say in books,"" said Lenox, with a grin. ""Narrow-minded,"" murmured Lady Tamplin. ""Inevitable under the circumstances, I suppose."" ""I expect you will do your best to broaden her,"" said Lenox, with a grin, ""but you will have your work cut out. Just now, you noticed, she stuck down her fore feet and laid back her ears and refused to budge."" ""Anyway,"" said Lady Tamplin hopefully, ""she doesn't look to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,4,"me at all mean. Some people, when they come into money, seem to attach undue importance to it."" ""Oh, you'll easily touch her for what you want,"" said Lenox; ""and, after all, that is all that matters, isn't it? That is what she is here for."" ""She is my own cousin,"" said Lady Tamplin, with dignity. ""Cousin, eh?"" said Mr. Evans, waking up again. ""I suppose I call her Katherine, don't I?"" ""It is of no importance at all what you call her, Chubby,"" said Lady Tamplin. ""Good,"" said Mr. Evans; ""then I will. Do you suppose she plays tennis?"" he added hopefully. ""Of course not,"" said Lady Tamplin. ""She has been a companion, I tell you. Companions don't play tennis--or golf. They might possibly play golf-croquet, but I have always understood that they wind wool and wash dogs most of the day."" ""O God!"" said Mr. Evans; ""do they really?"" Lenox drifted upstairs again to Katherine's room. ""Can I help you?"" she asked rather perfunctorily. On Katherine's disclaimer, Lenox sat on the edge of the bed and stared thoughtfully at her guest. ""Why did you come?"" she said at last. ""To us, I mean. We're not your sort."" ""Oh, I am anxious to get into Society."" ""Don't be an ass,"" said Lenox promptly, detecting the flicker of a smile. ""You know what"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,5,"I mean well enough. You are not a bit what I thought you would be. I say, you _have_ got some decent clothes."" She sighed. ""Clothes are no good to me. I was born awkward. It's a pity, because I love them."" ""I love them too,"" said Katherine, ""but it has not been much use my loving them up to now. Do you think this is nice?"" She and Lenox discussed several models with artistic fervour. ""I like you,"" said Lenox suddenly. ""I came up to warn you not to be taken in by Mother, but I think now that there is no need to do that. You are frightfully sincere and upright and all those queer things, but you are not a fool. Oh hell! what is it now?"" Lady Tamplin's voice was calling plaintively from the hall: ""Lenox, Derek has just rung up. He wants to come to dinner to-night. Will it be all right? I mean, we haven't got anything awkward, like quails, have we?"" Lenox reassured her and came back into Katherine's room. Her face looked brighter and less sullen. ""I'm glad old Derek is coming,"" she said; ""you'll like him."" ""Who is Derek?"" ""He is Lord Leconbury's son, married a rich American woman. Women are simply potty about him."" ""Why?"" ""Oh, the usual reason--very good-looking and a regular"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,6,"bad lot. Every one goes off their head about him."" ""Do you?"" ""Sometimes I do,"" said Lenox, ""and sometimes I think I would like to marry a nice curate and live in the country and grow things in frames."" She paused a minute, and then added, ""An Irish curate would be best, and then I should hunt."" After a minute or two she reverted to her former theme. ""There is something queer about Derek. All that family are a bit potty--mad gamblers, you know. In the old days they used to gamble away their wives and their estates, and did most reckless things just for the love of it. Derek would have made a perfect highwayman--debonair and gay, just the right manner."" She moved to the door. ""Well, come down when you feel like it."" Left alone, Katherine gave herself up to thought. Just at present she felt thoroughly ill at ease and jarred by her surroundings. The shock of the discovery in the train and the reception of the news by her new friends jarred upon her susceptibilities. She thought long and earnestly about the murdered woman. She had been sorry for Ruth, but she could not honestly say that she had liked her. She had divined only too well the ruthless egoism that was the keynote of her personality, and"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,7,"it repelled her. She had been amused and a trifle hurt by the other's cool dismissal of her when she had served her turn. That she had come to some decision, Katherine was quite certain, but she wondered now what that decision had been. Whatever it was, death had stepped in and made all decisions meaningless. Strange that it should have been so, and that a brutal crime should have been the ending of that fateful journey. But suddenly Katherine remembered a small fact that she ought, perhaps, to have told the police--a fact that had for the moment escaped her memory. Was it of any real importance? She had certainly thought that she had seen a man going into that particular compartment, but she realized that she might easily have been mistaken. It might have been the compartment next door, and certainly the man in question could be no train robber. She recalled him very clearly as she had seen him on those two previous occasions--once at the Savoy and once at Cook's office. No, doubtless she had been mistaken. He had not gone into the dead woman's compartment, and it was perhaps as well that she had said nothing to the police. She might have done incalculable harm by doing so. She went down to join the others on the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,8,"terrace outside. Through the branches of mimosa, she looked out over the blue of the Mediterranean, and, whilst listening with half an ear to Lady Tamplin's chatter, she was glad that she had come. This was better than St. Mary Mead. That evening she put on the mauvy pink dress that went by the name of _soupir d'automne_, and after smiling at her reflection in the mirror, went downstairs with, for the first time in her life, a faint feeling of shyness. Most of Lady Tamplin's guests had arrived, and since noise was the essential of Lady Tamplin's parties, the din was already terrific. Chubby rushed up to Katherine, pressed a cocktail upon her, and took her under his wing. ""Oh, here you are, Derek,"" cried Lady Tamplin, as the door opened to admit the last comer. ""Now at last we can have something to eat. I am starving."" Katherine looked across the room. She was startled. So this--was Derek, and she realized that she was not surprised. She had always known that she would some day meet the man whom she had seen three times by such a curious chain of coincidences. She thought, too, that he recognized her. He paused abruptly in what he was saying to Lady Tamplin, and went on again as though with an effort. They all"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,9,"went into dinner, and Katherine found that he was placed beside her. He turned to her at once with a vivid smile. ""I knew I was going to meet you soon,"" he remarked, ""but I never dreamt that it would be here. It had to be, you know. Once at the Savoy and once at Cook's--never twice without three times. Don't say you can't remember me or never noticed me. I insist upon your pretending that you noticed me, anyway."" ""Oh, I did,"" said Katherine; ""but this is not the third time. It is the fourth. I saw you on the Blue Train."" ""On the Blue Train!"" Something undefinable came over his manner; she could not have said just what it was. It was as though he had received a check, a setback. Then he said carelessly: ""What was the rumpus this morning? Somebody had died, hadn't they?"" ""Yes,"" said Katherine slowly; ""somebody had died."" ""You shouldn't die on a train,"" remarked Derek flippantly. ""I believe it causes all sorts of legal and international complications, and it gives the train an excuse for being even later than usual."" ""Mr. Kettering?"" A stout American lady, who was sitting opposite, leaned forward and spoke to him with the deliberate intonation of her race. ""Mr. Kettering, I do believe you have forgotten me, and I"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,12,12. At the Villa Marguerite,10,"thought you such a perfectly lovely man."" Derek leaned forward, answering her, and Katherine sat almost dazed. Kettering! That was the name, of course! She remembered it now--but what a strange, ironical situation! Here was this man whom she had seen go into his wife's compartment last night, who had left her alive and well, and now he was sitting at dinner, quite unconscious of the fate that had befallen her. Of that there was no doubt. He did not know. A servant was leaning over Derek, handing him a note and murmuring in his ear. With a word of excuse to Lady Tamplin, he broke it open, and an expression of utter astonishment came over his face as he read; then he looked at his hostess. ""This is most extraordinary. I say, Rosalie, I am afraid I will have to leave you. The Prefect of Police wants to see me at once. I can't think what about."" ""Your sins have found you out,"" remarked Lenox. ""They must have,"" said Derek; ""probably some idiotic nonsense, but I suppose I shall have to push off to the Prefecture. How dare the old boy rout me out from dinner? It ought to be something deadly serious to justify that,"" and he laughed as he pushed back his chair and rose to leave the room."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,1,"On the afternoon of the 15th of February a thick yellow fog had settled down on London. Rufus Van Aldin was in his suite at the Savoy and was making the most of the atmospheric conditions by working double time. Knighton was overjoyed. He had found it difficult of late to get his employer to concentrate on the matters in hand. When he had ventured to urge certain courses, Van Aldin had put him off with a curt word. But now Van Aldin seemed to be throwing himself into work with redoubled energy, and the secretary made the most of his opportunities. Always tactful, he plied the spur so unobtrusively that Van Aldin never suspected it. Yet in the middle of this absorption in business matters, one little"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,2,"fact lay at the back of Van Aldin's mind. A chance remark of Knighton's, uttered by the secretary in all unconsciousness, had given rise to it. It now festered unseen, gradually reaching further and further forward into Van Aldin's consciousness, until at last, in spite of himself, he had to yield to its insistence. He listened to what Knighton was saying with his usual air of keen attention, but in reality not one word of it penetrated his mind. He nodded automatically, however, and the secretary turned to some other papers. As he was sorting them out, his employer spoke: ""Do you mind telling me that over again, Knighton?"" For a moment Knighton was at a loss. ""You mean about this, sir?"" He held up a closely written"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,3,"Company report. ""No, no,"" said Van Aldin; ""what you told me about seeing Ruth's maid in Paris last night. I can't make it out. You must have been mistaken."" ""I can't have been mistaken, sir; I actually spoke to her."" ""Well, tell me the whole thing again."" Knighton complied. ""I had fixed up the deal with Bartheimers,"" he explained, ""and had gone back to the Ritz to pick up my traps preparatory to having dinner and catching the nine o'clock train from the Gare du Nord. At the reception desk I saw a woman whom I was quite sure was Mrs. Kettering's maid. I went up to her and asked if Mrs. Kettering was staying there."" ""Yes, yes,"" said Van Aldin. ""Of course. Naturally. And she told you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,4,"that Ruth had gone on to the Riviera and had sent her to the Ritz to await further orders there?"" ""Exactly that, sir."" ""It is very odd,"" said Van Aldin. ""Very odd, indeed, unless the woman had been impertinent or something of that kind."" ""In that case,"" objected Knighton, ""surely Mrs. Kettering would have paid her down a sum of money, and told her to go back to England. She would hardly have sent her to the Ritz."" ""No,"" muttered the millionaire; ""that's true."" He was about to say something further, but checked himself. He was fond of Knighton and liked and trusted him, but he could hardly discuss his daughter's private affairs with his secretary. He had already felt hurt by Ruth's lack of frankness, and this"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,5,"chance information which had come to him did nothing to allay his misgivings. Why had Ruth got rid of her maid in Paris? What possible object or motive could she have had in so doing? He reflected for a moment or two on the curious combination of chance. How should it have occurred to Ruth, except as the wildest coincidence, that the first person that the maid should run across in Paris should be her father's secretary? Ah, but that was the way things happened. That was the way things got found out. He winced at the last phrase; it had arisen with complete naturalness to his mind. Was there then ""something to be found out""? He hated to put this question to himself; he had no doubt"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,6,"of the answer. The answer was--he was sure of it--Armand de la Roche. It was bitter to Van Aldin that a daughter of his should be gulled by such a man, yet he was forced to admit that she was in good company--that other well-bred and intelligent women had succumbed just as easily to the Count's fascination. Men saw through him, women did not. He sought now for a phrase that would allay any suspicion that his secretary might have felt. ""Ruth is always changing her mind about things at a moment's notice,"" he remarked, and then he added in a would-be careless tone: ""The maid didn't give any--er--reason for this change of plan?"" Knighton was careful to make his voice as natural as possible as he replied:"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,7,"""She said, sir, that Mrs. Kettering had met a friend unexpectedly."" ""Is that so?"" The secretary's practised ears caught the note of strain underlying the seemingly casual tone. ""Oh, I see. Man or woman?"" ""I think she said a man, sir."" Van Aldin nodded. His worst fears were being realized. He rose from his chair, and began pacing up and down the room, a habit of his when agitated. Unable to contain his feelings any longer, he burst forth: ""There is one thing no man can do, and that is to get a woman to listen to reason. Somehow or other, they don't seem to have any kind of _sense_. Talk of woman's instinct--why, it is well known all the world over that a woman is the surest"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,8,"mark for any rascally swindler. Not one in ten of them knows a scoundrel when she meets one; they can be preyed on by any good-looking fellow with a soft side to his tongue. If I had my way--"" He was interrupted. A page-boy entered with a telegram. Van Aldin tore it open, and his face went a sudden chalky white. He caught hold of the back of a chair to steady himself, and waved the page-boy from the room. ""What's the matter, sir?"" Knighton had risen in concern. ""Ruth!"" said Van Aldin hoarsely. ""Mrs. Kettering?"" ""Killed!"" ""An accident to the train?"" Van Aldin shook his head. ""No. From this it seems she has been robbed as well. They don't use the word, Knighton, but my poor girl"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,9,"has been murdered."" ""Oh, my God, sir!"" Van Aldin tapped the telegram with his forefinger. ""This is from the police at Nice. I must go out there by the first train."" Knighton was efficient as ever. He glanced at the clock. ""Five o'clock from Victoria, sir."" ""That's right. You will come with me, Knighton. Tell my man, Archer, and pack your own things. See to everything here. I want to go round to Curzon Street."" The telephone rang sharply, and the secretary lifted the receiver. ""Yes; who is it?"" Then to Van Aldin. ""Mr. Goby, sir."" ""Goby? I can't see him now. No--wait, we have plenty of time. Tell them to send him up."" Van Aldin was a strong man. Already he had recovered that iron calm"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,13,13. Van Aldin Gets a Telegram,10,"of his. Few people would have noticed anything amiss in his greeting to Mr. Goby. ""I am pressed for time, Goby. Got anything important to tell me?"" Mr. Goby coughed. ""The movements of Mr. Kettering, sir. You wished them reported to you."" ""Yes--well?"" ""Mr. Kettering, sir, left London for the Riviera yesterday morning."" ""What?"" Something in his voice must have startled Mr. Goby. That worthy gentleman departed from his usual practice of never looking at the person to whom he was talking, and stole a fleeting glance at the millionaire. ""What train did he go on?"" demanded Van Aldin. ""The Blue Train, sir."" Mr. Goby coughed again and spoke to the clock on the mantelpiece. ""Mademoiselle Mirelle, the dancer from the Parthenon, went by the same train."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,1,"""I cannot repeat to you often enough, Monsieur, our horror, our consternation, and the deep sympathy we feel for you."" Thus M. Carrège, the Juge d'Instruction, addressed Van Aldin. M. Caux, the Commissary, made sympathetic noises in his throat. Van Aldin brushed away horror, consternation, and sympathy with an abrupt gesture. The scene was the Examining Magistrate's room at Nice. Besides M. Carrège, the Commissary, and Van Aldin, there was a further person in the room. It was that person who now spoke. ""M. Van Aldin,"" he said, ""desires action--swift action."" ""Ah!"" cried the Commissary, ""I have not yet presented you. M. Van Aldin, this is M. Hercule Poirot; you have doubtless heard of him. Although he has retired from his profession for some years now, his name is still a household word as one of the greatest living detectives."" ""Pleased to meet you, M. Poirot,"" said Van Aldin, falling"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,2,"back mechanically on a formula that he had discarded some years ago. ""You have retired from your profession?"" ""That is so, Monsieur. Now I enjoy the world."" The little man made a grandiloquent gesture. ""M. Poirot happened to be travelling on the Blue Train,"" explained the Commissary, ""and he has been so kind as to assist us out of his vast experience."" The millionaire looked at Poirot keenly. Then he said unexpectedly: ""I am a very rich man, M. Poirot. It is usually said that a rich man labours under the belief that he can buy everything and every one. That is not true. I am a big man in my way, and one big man can ask a favour from another big man."" Poirot nodded a quick appreciation. ""That is very well said, M. Van Aldin. I place myself entirely at your service."" ""Thank you,"" said Van Aldin. ""I"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,3,"can only say call upon me at any time, and you will not find me ungrateful. And now, gentlemen, to business."" ""I propose,"" said M. Carrège, ""to interrogate the maid, Ada Mason. You have her here, I understand?"" ""Yes,"" said Van Aldin. ""We picked her up in Paris in passing through. She was very upset to hear of her mistress's death, but she tells her story coherently enough."" ""We will have her in, then,"" said M. Carrège. He rang the bell on his desk, and in a few minutes Ada Mason entered the room. She was very neatly dressed in black, and the tip of her nose was red. She had exchanged her grey travelling gloves for a pair of black suède ones. She cast a look round the Examining Magistrate's office in some trepidation, and seemed relieved at the presence of her mistress's father. The Examining Magistrate prided himself"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,4,"on his geniality of manner, and did his best to put her at her ease. He was helped in this by Poirot, who acted as interpreter, and whose friendly manner was reassuring to the Englishwoman. ""Your name is Ada Mason; is that right?"" ""Ada Beatrice I was christened, sir,"" said Mason primly. ""Just so. And we can understand, Mason, that this has all been very distressing."" ""Oh, indeed it has, sir. I have been with many ladies and always given satisfaction, I hope, and I never dreamt of anything of this kind happening in any situation where I was."" ""No, no,"" said M. Carrège. ""Naturally I have read of such things, of course, in the Sunday papers. And then I always have understood that those foreign trains--"" She suddenly checked her flow, remembering that the gentlemen who were speaking to her were of the same nationality as the trains. ""Now"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,5,"let us talk this affair over,"" said M. Carrège. ""There was, I understand, no question of your staying in Paris when you started from London?"" ""Oh no, sir. We were to go straight through to Nice."" ""Have you ever been abroad with your mistress before?"" ""No, sir. I had only been with her two months, you see."" ""Did she seem quite as usual when starting on this journey?"" ""She was worried like and a bit upset, and she was rather irritable and difficult to please."" M. Carrège nodded. ""Now then, Mason, what was the first you heard of your stopping in Paris?"" ""It was at the place they call the Gare de Lyon, sir. My mistress was thinking of getting out and walking up and down the platform. She was just going out into the corridor when she gave a sudden exclamation, and came back into her compartment with"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,6,"a gentleman. She shut the door between her carriage and mine, so that I didn't see or hear anything, till she suddenly opened it again and told me that she had changed her plans. She gave me some money and told me to get out and go to the Ritz. They knew her well there, she said, and would give me a room. I was to wait there until I heard from her; she would wire me what she wanted me to do. I had just time to get my things together and jump out of the train before it started off. It was a rush."" ""While Mrs. Kettering was telling you this, where was the gentleman?"" ""He was standing in the other compartment, sir, looking out of the window."" ""Can you describe him to us?"" ""Well, you see, sir, I hardly saw him. He had his back to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,7,"me most of the time. He was a tall gentleman and dark; that's all I can say. He was dressed very like any other gentleman in a dark blue overcoat and a grey hat."" ""Was he one of the passengers on the train?"" ""I don't think so, sir; I took it that he had come to the station to see Mrs. Kettering in passing through. Of course he might have been one of the passengers; I never thought of that."" Mason seemed a little flurried by the suggestion. ""Ah!"" M. Carrège passed lightly to another subject. ""Your mistress later requested the conductor not to rouse her early in the morning. Was that a likely thing for her to do, do you think?"" ""Oh yes, sir. The mistress never ate any breakfast and she didn't sleep well at nights, so that she liked sleeping on in the morning."" Again M."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,8,"Carrège passed to another subject. ""Amongst the luggage there was a scarlet morocco case, was there not?"" he asked. ""Your mistress's jewel-case?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Did you take that case to the Ritz?"" ""_Me_ take the mistress's jewel-case to the Ritz! Oh no, indeed, sir."" Mason's tones were horrified. ""You left it behind you in the carriage?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Had your mistress many jewels with her, do you know?"" ""A fair amount, sir; made me a bit uneasy sometimes, I can tell you, with those nasty tales you hear of being robbed in foreign countries. They were insured, I know, but all the same it seemed a frightful risk. Why, the rubies alone, the mistress told me, were worth several hundred thousand pounds."" ""The rubies! What rubies?"" barked Van Aldin suddenly. Mason turned to him. ""I think it was you who gave them to her, sir, not very long ago."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,9,"""My God!"" cried Van Aldin. ""You don't say she had those rubies with her? I told her to leave them at the Bank."" Mason gave once more the discreet cough which was apparently part of her stock-in-trade as a lady's maid. This time it expressed a good deal. It expressed far more clearly than words could have done, that Mason's mistress had been a lady who took her own way. ""Ruth must have been mad,"" muttered Van Aldin. ""What on earth could have possessed her?"" M. Carrège in turn gave vent to a cough, again a cough of significance. It riveted Van Aldin's attention on him. ""For the moment,"" said M. Carrège, addressing Mason, ""I think that is all. If you will go into the next room, Mademoiselle, they will read over to you the questions and answers, and you will sign accordingly."" Mason went out escorted by the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,14,14. Ada Mason's Story,10,"clerk, and Van Aldin said immediately to the Magistrate: ""Well?"" M. Carrège opened a drawer in his desk, took out a letter, and handed it across to Van Aldin. ""This was found in Madame's handbag."" _""Chère Amie"" (the letter ran)--""I will obey you; I will be prudent, discreet--all those things that a lover most hates. Paris would perhaps have been unwise, but the Isles d'Or are far away from the world, and you may be assured that nothing will leak out. It is like you and your divine sympathy to be so interested in the work on famous jewels that I am writing. It will, indeed, be an extraordinary privilege to actually see and handle these historic rubies. I am devoting a special passage to 'Heart of Fire.' My wonderful one! Soon I will make up to you for all those sad years of separation and emptiness.--Your ever-adoring,_ ""_Armand._"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,1,"Van Aldin read the letter through in silence. His face turned a dull angry crimson. The men watching him saw the veins start out on his forehead, and his big hands clench themselves unconsciously. He handed back the letter without a word. M. Carrège was looking with close attention at his desk, M. Caux's eyes were fixed upon the ceiling, and M. Hercule Poirot was tenderly brushing a speck of dust from his coat sleeve. With the greatest tact they none of them looked at Van Aldin. It was M. Carrège, mindful of his status and his duties, who tackled the unpleasant subject. ""Perhaps, Monsieur,"" he murmured, ""you are aware by whom--er--this letter was written?"" ""Yes, I know,"" said Van Aldin heavily. ""Ah?"" said the Magistrate inquiringly. ""A scoundrel who calls himself the Comte de la Roche."" There was a pause; then M. Poirot leaned forward, straightened a ruler on the judge's desk, and addressed the millionaire directly. ""M. Van Aldin, we are all sensible, deeply sensible, of the pain it must give you to speak of these matters, but believe me, Monsieur, it is not the time for concealments. If"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,2,"justice is to be done, we must know everything. If you will reflect a little minute you will realize the truth of that clearly for yourself."" Van Aldin was silent for a moment or two, then almost reluctantly he nodded his head in agreement. ""You are quite right, M. Poirot,"" he said. ""Painful as it is, I have no right to keep anything back."" The Commissary gave a sigh of relief, and the Examining Magistrate leaned back in his chair and adjusted a pince-nez on his long thin nose. ""Perhaps you will tell us in your own words, M. Van Aldin,"" he said, ""all that you know of this gentleman."" ""It began eleven or twelve years ago--in Paris. My daughter was a young girl then, full of foolish, romantic notions, like all young girls are. Unknown to me, she made the acquaintance of this Comte de la Roche. You have heard of him, perhaps?"" The Commissary and Poirot nodded in assent. ""He calls himself the Comte de la Roche,"" continued Van Aldin, ""but I doubt if he has any right to the title."" ""You would not have found his name in"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,3,"the _Almanach de Gotha_,"" agreed the Commissary. ""I discovered as much,"" said Van Aldin. ""The man was a good-looking, plausible scoundrel, with a fatal fascination for women. Ruth was infatuated with him, but I soon put a stop to the whole affair. The man was no better than a common swindler."" ""You are quite right,"" said the Commissary. ""The Comte de la Roche is well known to us. If it were possible, we should have laid him by the heels before now, but _ma foi!_ it is not easy; the fellow is cunning, his affairs are always conducted with ladies of high social position. If he obtains money from them under false pretences or as the fruit of blackmail, _eh bien!_ naturally they will not prosecute. To look foolish in the eyes of the world, oh no, that would never do, and he has an extraordinary power over women."" ""That is so,"" said the millionaire heavily. ""Well, as I told you, I broke the affair up pretty sharply. I told Ruth exactly what he was, and she had, perforce, to believe me. About a year afterwards, she met her present husband"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,4,"and married him. As far as I knew, that was the end of the matter; but only a week ago, I discovered, to my amazement, that my daughter had resumed her acquaintance with the Comte de la Roche. She had been meeting him frequently in London and Paris. I remonstrated with her on her imprudence, for I may tell you gentlemen, that, on my insistence, she was preparing to bring a suit for divorce against her husband."" ""That is interesting,"" murmured Poirot softly, his eyes on the ceiling. Van Aldin looked at him sharply, and then went on. ""I pointed out to her the folly of continuing to see the Comte under the circumstances. I thought she agreed with me."" The Examining Magistrate coughed delicately. ""But according to this letter--"" he began, and then stopped. Van Aldin's jaw set itself squarely. ""I know. It's no good mincing matters. However unpleasant, we have got to face facts. It seems clear that Ruth had arranged to go to Paris and meet de la Roche there. After my warnings to her, however, she must have written to the Count suggesting a change of rendezvous."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,5,"""The Isles d'Or,"" said the Commissary thoughtfully, ""are situated just opposite Hyères, a remote and idyllic spot."" Van Aldin nodded. ""My God! How could Ruth be such a fool?"" he exclaimed bitterly. ""All this talk about writing a book on jewels! Why, he must have been after the rubies from the first."" ""There are some very famous rubies,"" said Poirot, ""originally part of the Crown jewels of Russia; they are unique in character, and their value is almost fabulous. There has been a rumour that they have lately passed into the possession of an American. Are we right in concluding, Monsieur, that you were the purchaser?"" ""Yes,"" said Van Aldin. ""They came into my possession in Paris about ten days ago."" ""Pardon me, Monsieur, but you have been negotiating for their purchase for some time?"" ""A little over two months. Why?"" ""These things become known,"" said Poirot. ""There is always a pretty formidable crowd on the track of jewels such as these."" A spasm distorted the other's face. ""I remember,"" he said brokenly, ""a joke I made to Ruth when I gave them to her. I told her not to take"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,6,"them to the Riviera with her, as I could not afford to have her robbed and murdered for the sake of the jewels. My God! the things one says--never dreaming or knowing they will come true."" There was a sympathetic silence, and then Poirot spoke in a detached manner. ""Let us arrange our facts with order and precision. According to our present theory, this is how they run. The Comte de la Roche knows of your purchase of these jewels. By an easy stratagem he induces Madame Kettering to bring the stones with her. He, then, is the man Mason saw in the train at Paris."" The other three nodded in agreement. ""Madame is surprised to see him, but she deals with the situation promptly. Mason is got out of the way; a dinner basket is ordered. We know from the conductor that he made up the berth for the first compartment, but he did not go into the second compartment, and that a man could quite well have been concealed from him. So far the Comte could have been hidden to a marvel. No one knows of his presence on"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,7,"the train except Madame; he has been careful that the maid did not see his face. All that she could say is that he was tall and dark. It is all most conveniently vague. They are alone--and the train rushes through the night. There would be no outcry, no struggle, for the man is, so she thinks, her lover."" He turned gently to Van Aldin. ""Death, Monsieur, must have been almost instantaneous. We will pass over that quickly. The Comte takes the jewel-case which lies ready to his hand. Shortly afterwards the train draws into Lyons."" M. Carrège nodded his approval. ""Precisely. The conductor without descends. It would be easy for our man to leave the train unseen; it would be easy to catch a train back to Paris or anywhere he pleases. And the crime would be put down as an ordinary train robbery. But for the letter found in Madame's bag, the Comte would not have been mentioned."" ""It was an oversight on his part not to search that bag,"" declared the Commissary. ""Without doubt he thought she had destroyed that letter. It was--pardon me, Monsieur--it was an indiscretion"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,8,"of the first water to keep it."" ""And yet,"" murmured Poirot, ""it was an indiscretion the Comte might have foreseen."" ""You mean?"" ""I mean we are all agreed on one point, and that is that the Comte de la Roche knows one subject _à fond_: Women. How was it that, knowing women as he does, he did not foresee that Madame would have kept that letter?"" ""Yes--yes,"" said the Examining Magistrate doubtfully, ""there is something in what you say. But at such times, you understand, a man is not master of himself. He does not reason calmly. _Mon Dieu!_"" he added, with feeling, ""if our criminals kept their heads and acted with intelligence, how should we capture them?"" Poirot smiled to himself. ""It seems to me a clear case,"" said the other, ""but a difficult one to prove. The Comte is a slippery customer, and unless the maid can identify him--"" ""Which is most unlikely,"" said Poirot. ""True, true."" The Examining Magistrate rubbed his chin. ""It is going to be difficult."" ""If he did indeed commit the crime--"" began Poirot. M. Caux interrupted. ""If--you say _if_?"" ""Yes, Monsieur le Juge, I"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,9,"say _if_."" The other looked at him sharply. ""You are right,"" he said at last, ""we go too fast. It is possible that the Comte may have an alibi. Then we should look foolish."" ""_Ah, ça par exemple_,"" replied Poirot, ""that is of no importance whatever. Naturally, if he committed the crime he will have an alibi. A man with the Comte's experience does not neglect to take precautions. No, I said _if_ for a very different reason."" ""And what was that?"" Poirot wagged an emphatic forefinger. ""The psychology."" ""Eh?"" said the Commissary. ""The psychology is at fault. The Comte is a scoundrel--yes. The Comte is a swindler--yes. The Comte preys upon women--yes. He proposes to steal Madame's jewels--again yes. Is he the kind of man to commit murder? I say _no_! A man of the type of the Comte is always a coward; he takes no risks. He plays the safe, the mean, what the English call the low-down game; but murder, a hundred times no!"" He shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. The Examining Magistrate, however, did not seem disposed to agree with him. ""The day always comes"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,15,15. The Comte de la Roche,10,"when such gentry lose their heads and go too far,"" he observed sagely. ""Doubtless that is the case here. Without wishing to disagree with you, M. Poirot--"" ""It was only an opinion,"" Poirot hastened to explain. ""The case is, of course, in your hands, and you will do what seems fit to you."" ""I am satisfied in my own mind that the Comte de la Roche is the man we need to get hold of,"" said M. Carrège. ""You agree with me, Monsieur le Commissaire?"" ""Perfectly."" ""And you, M. Van Aldin?"" ""Yes,"" said the millionaire. ""Yes; the man is a thorough-paced villain, no doubt about it."" ""It will be difficult to lay hands on him, I am afraid,"" said the Magistrate, ""but we will do our best. Telegraphed instructions shall go out at once."" ""Permit me to assist you,"" said Poirot. ""There need be no difficulty."" ""Eh?"" The others stared at him. The little man smiled beamingly back at them. ""It is my business to know things,"" he explained. ""The Comte is a man of intelligence. He is at present at a villa he has leased, the Villa Marina at Antibes."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,1,"Everybody looked respectfully at Poirot. Undoubtedly the little man had scored heavily. The Commissary laughed--on a rather hollow note. ""You teach us all our business,"" he cried. ""M. Poirot knows more than the police."" Poirot gazed complacently at the ceiling, adopting a mock-modest air. ""What will you; it is my little hobby,"" he murmured, ""to know things. Naturally I have the time to indulge it. I am not overburdened with affairs."" ""Ah!"" said the Commissary shaking his head portentously. ""As for me--"" He made an exaggerated gesture to represent the cares that lay on his shoulders. Poirot turned suddenly to Van Aldin. ""You agree, Monsieur, with this view? You feel certain that the Comte de la Roche is the murderer?"" ""Why, it would seem so--yes, certainly."" Something guarded in the answer made the Examining Magistrate look at the American curiously. Van Aldin seemed aware of his scrutiny and made an effort as though to shake off some preoccupation. ""What about my son-in-law?"" he asked. ""You have acquainted him with the news? He is in Nice, I understand."" ""Certainly, Monsieur."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,2,"The Commissary hesitated, and then murmured very discreetly: ""You are doubtless aware, M. Van Aldin, that M. Kettering was also one of the passengers on the Blue Train that night?"" The millionaire nodded. ""Heard it just before I left London,"" he vouchsafed laconically. ""He tells us,"" continued the Commissary, ""that he had no idea his wife was travelling on the train."" ""I bet he hadn't,"" said Van Aldin grimly. ""It would have been rather a nasty shock to him if he'd come across her on it."" The three men looked at him questioningly. ""I'm not going to mince matters,"" said Van Aldin savagely. ""No one knows what my poor girl has had to put up with. Derek Kettering wasn't alone. He had a lady with him."" ""Ah?"" ""Mirelle--the dancer."" M. Carrège and the Commissary looked at each other and nodded as though confirming some previous conversation. M. Carrège leaned back in his chair, joined his hands, and fixed his eyes on the ceiling. ""Ah!"" he murmured again. ""One wondered."" He coughed. ""One has heard rumours."" ""The lady,"" said M."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,3,"Caux, ""is very notorious."" ""And also,"" murmured Poirot softly, ""very expensive."" Van Aldin had gone very red in the face. He leant forward and hit the table a bang with his fist. ""See here,"" he cried, ""my son-in-law is a damned scoundrel!"" He glared at them, looking from one face to another. ""Oh, I know,"" he went on. ""Good looks and a charming, easy manner. It took me in once upon a time. I suppose he pretended to be broken-hearted when you broke the news to him--that is, if he didn't know it already."" ""Oh, it came as a complete surprise to him. He was overwhelmed."" ""Darned young hypocrite,"" said Van Aldin. ""Simulated great grief, I suppose?"" ""N--no,"" said the Commissary cautiously. ""I would not quite say that--eh, M. Carrège?"" The Magistrate brought the tips of his fingers together, and half closed his eyes. ""Shock, bewilderment, horror--these things, yes,"" he declared judicially. ""Great sorrow--no--I should not say that."" Hercule Poirot spoke once more. ""Permit me to ask, M. Van Aldin, does M. Kettering benefit by the death of his"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,4,"wife?"" ""He benefits to the tune of a couple of millions,"" said Van Aldin. ""Dollars?"" ""Pounds. I settled that sum on Ruth absolutely on her marriage. She made no will and leaves no children, so the money will go to her husband."" ""Whom she was on the point of divorcing,"" murmured Poirot. ""Ah, yes--_précisément_."" The Commissary turned and looked sharply at him. ""Do you mean--"" he began. ""I mean nothing,"" said Poirot. ""I arrange the facts, that is all."" Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest. The little man rose to his feet. ""I do not think I can be of any further service to you, M. le Juge,"" he said politely, bowing to M. Carrège. ""You will keep me informed of the course of events? It will be a kindness."" ""But certainly--most certainly."" Van Aldin rose also. ""You don't want me any more at present?"" ""No, Monsieur; we have all the information we need for the moment."" ""Then I will walk a little way with M. Poirot. That is, if he does not object?"" ""Enchanted, Monsieur,"" said"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,5,"the little man, with a bow. Van Aldin lighted a large cigar, having first offered one to Poirot, who declined it and lit one of his own tiny cigarettes. A man of great strength of character, Van Aldin already appeared to be his everyday, normal self once more. After strolling along for a minute or two in silence, the millionaire spoke: ""I take it, M. Poirot, that you no longer exercise your profession?"" ""That is so, Monsieur. I enjoy the world."" ""Yet you are assisting the police in this affair?"" ""Monsieur, if a doctor walks along the street and an accident happens, does he say, 'I have retired from my profession, I will continue my walk,' when there is some one bleeding to death at his feet? If I had been already in Nice, and the police had sent to me and asked me to assist them, I should have refused. But this affair, the good God thrust it upon me."" ""You were on the spot,"" said Van Aldin thoughtfully. ""You examined the compartment, did you not?"" Poirot nodded."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,6,"""Doubtless you found things that were, shall we say, suggestive to you?"" ""Perhaps,"" said Poirot. ""I hope you see what I am leading up to?"" said Van Aldin. ""It seems to me that the case against this Comte de la Roche is perfectly clear, but I am not a fool. I have been watching you for this last hour or so, and I realize that for some reason of your own you don't agree with that theory?"" Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""I may be wrong."" ""So we come to the favour I want to ask you. Will you act in this matter for me?"" ""For you personally?"" ""That was my meaning."" Poirot was silent for a moment or two. Then he said: ""You realize what you are asking?"" ""I guess so,"" said Van Aldin. ""Very well,"" said Poirot. ""I accept. But in that case, I must have frank answers to my questions."" ""Why, certainly. That is understood."" Poirot's manner changed. He became suddenly brusque and business-like. ""This question of a divorce,"" he said. ""It was you who advised your"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,7,"daughter to bring the suit?"" ""Yes."" ""When?"" ""About ten days ago. I had had a letter from her complaining of her husband's behaviour, and I put it to her very strongly that divorce was the only remedy."" ""In what way did she complain of his behaviour?"" ""He was being seen about with a _very_ notorious lady--the one we have been speaking of--Mirelle."" ""The dancer. Ah-ha! And Madame Kettering objected? Was she very devoted to her husband?"" ""I would not say that,"" said Van Aldin, hesitating a little. ""It was not her heart that suffered, it was her pride--is that what you would say?"" ""Yes, I suppose you might put it like that."" ""I gather that the marriage had not been a happy one from the beginning?"" ""Derek Kettering is rotten to the core,"" said Van Aldin. ""He is incapable of making any woman happy."" ""He is, as you say in England, a bad lot. That is right, is it not?"" Van Aldin nodded. ""_Très bien!_ You advise Madame to seek a divorce, she agrees; you consult your solicitors. When"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,8,"does M. Kettering get news of what is in the wind?"" ""I sent for him myself, and explained the course of action I proposed to take."" ""And what did he say?"" murmured Poirot softly. Van Aldin's face darkened at the remembrance. ""He was infernally impudent."" ""Excuse the question, Monsieur, but did he refer to the Comte de la Roche?"" ""Not by name,"" growled the other unwillingly, ""but he showed himself cognizant of the affair."" ""What, if I may ask, was M. Kettering's financial position at the time?"" ""How do you suppose I should know that?"" asked Van Aldin, after a very brief hesitation. ""It seemed likely to me that you would inform yourself on that point."" ""Well--you are quite right, I did. I discovered that Kettering was on the rocks."" ""And now he has inherited two million pounds! _La vie_--it is a strange thing, is it not?"" Van Aldin looked at him sharply. ""What do you mean?"" ""I moralize,"" said Poirot. ""I reflect, I speak the philosophy. But to return to where we were. Surely M. Kettering did not"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,9,"propose to allow himself to be divorced without making a fight for it?"" Van Aldin did not answer for a minute or two, then he said: ""I don't exactly know what his intentions were."" ""Did you hold any further communications with him?"" Again a slight pause, then Van Aldin said: ""No."" Poirot stopped dead, took off his hat, and held out his hand. ""I must wish you good-day, Monsieur. I can do nothing for you."" ""What are you getting at?"" demanded Van Aldin angrily. ""If you do not tell me the truth, I can do nothing."" ""I don't know what you mean."" ""I think you do. You may rest assured, M. Van Aldin, that I know how to be discreet."" ""Very well, then,"" said the millionaire. ""I'll admit that I was not speaking the truth just now. I _did_ have further communication with my son-in-law."" ""Yes?"" ""To be exact, I sent my secretary, Major Knighton, to see him, with instructions to offer him the sum of one hundred thousand pounds in cash if the divorce went through undefended."" ""A"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,16,16. Poirot Discusses the Case,10,"pretty sum of money,"" said Poirot appreciatively; ""and the answer of Monsieur your son-in-law?"" ""He sent back word that I could go to hell,"" replied the millionaire succinctly. ""Ah!"" said Poirot. He betrayed no emotion of any kind. At the moment he was engaged in methodically recording facts. ""Monsieur Kettering has told the police that he neither saw nor spoke to his wife on the journey from England. Are you inclined to believe that statement, Monsieur?"" ""Yes, I am,"" said Van Aldin. ""He would take particular pains to keep out of her way, I should say."" ""Why?"" ""Because he had got that woman with him."" ""Mirelle?"" ""Yes."" ""How did you come to know that fact?"" ""A man of mine, whom I had put on to watch him, reported to me that they had both left by that train."" ""I see,"" said Poirot. ""In that case, as you said before, he would not be likely to attempt to hold any communication with Madame Kettering."" The little man fell silent for some time. Van Aldin did not interrupt his meditation."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,1,"""You have been to the Riviera before, Georges?"" said Poirot to his valet the following morning. George was an intensely English, rather wooden-faced individual. ""Yes, sir. I was here two years ago when I was in the service of Lord Edward Frampton."" ""And to-day,"" murmured his master, ""you are here with Hercule Poirot. How one mounts in the world!"" The valet made no reply to this observation. After a suitable pause he asked: ""The brown lounge suit, sir? The wind is somewhat chilly to-day."" ""There is a grease spot on the waistcoat,"" objected Poirot. ""A _morceau_ of _filet de sole à la Jeannette_ alighted there when I was lunching at the Ritz last Tuesday."" ""There is no spot there now, sir,"" said George reproachfully. ""I have removed it."" ""_Très bien!_"" said Poirot. ""I am pleased with you, Georges."" ""Thank you, sir."" There was a pause, and then Poirot murmured dreamily: ""Supposing, my good Georges, that you had been born in the same social sphere as your late master, Lord Edward Frampton--that, penniless yourself, you had married an extremely wealthy wife, but that that wife proposed to divorce you, with excellent reasons, what would you do about it?"" ""I should endeavour, sir,"" replied George, ""to make her change her mind."" ""By peaceful or by forcible methods?"" George looked shocked. ""You will excuse me, sir,"" he said, ""but a gentleman of the aristocracy would not behave like a Whitechapel coster. He would not"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,2,"do anything low."" ""Would he not, Georges? I wonder now. Well, perhaps you are right."" There was a knock on the door. George went to it and opened it a discreet inch or two. A low murmured colloquy went on, and then the valet returned to Poirot. ""A note, sir."" Poirot took it. It was from M. Caux, the Commissary of Police. ""We are about to interrogate the Comte de la Roche. The Juge d'Instruction begs that you will be present."" ""Quickly, my suit, Georges! I must hasten myself."" A quarter of an hour later, spick and span in his brown suit, Poirot entered the Examining Magistrate's room. M. Caux was already there, and both he and M. Carrège greeted Poirot with polite _empressement_. ""The affair is somewhat discouraging,"" murmured M. Caux. ""It appears that the Comte arrived in Nice the day before the murder."" ""If that is true, it will settle your affair nicely for you,"" responded Poirot. M. Carrège cleared his throat. ""We must not accept this alibi without very cautious inquiry,"" he declared. He struck the bell upon the table with his hand. In another minute a tall dark man, exquisitely dressed, with a somewhat haughty cast of countenance, entered the room. So very aristocratic-looking was the Count, that it would have seemed sheer heresy even to whisper that his father had been an obscure corn-chandler in Nantes--which, as a matter of fact, was the case. Looking at"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,3,"him, one would have been prepared to swear that innumerable ancestors of his must have perished by the guillotine in the French Revolution. ""I am here, gentlemen,"" said the Count haughtily. ""May I ask why you wish to see me?"" ""Pray be seated, Monsieur le Comte,"" said the Examining Magistrate politely. ""It is the affair of the death of Madame Kettering that we are investigating."" ""The death of Madame Kettering? I do not understand."" ""You were--ahem!--acquainted with the lady, I believe, Monsieur le Comte?"" ""Certainly I was acquainted with her. What has that to do with the matter?"" Sticking an eyeglass in his eye, he looked coldly round the room, his glance resting longest on Poirot, who was gazing at him with a kind of simple, innocent admiration which was most pleasing to the Count's vanity. M. Carrège leaned back in his chair and cleared his throat. ""You do not perhaps know, Monsieur le Comte""--he paused--""that Madame Kettering was murdered?"" ""Murdered? _Mon Dieu_, how terrible!"" The surprise and the sorrow were excellently done--so well done, indeed, as to seem wholly natural. ""Madame Kettering was strangled between Paris and Lyons,"" continued M. Carrège, ""and her jewels were stolen."" ""It is iniquitous!"" cried the Count warmly; ""the police should do something about these train bandits. Nowadays no one is safe."" ""In Madame's handbag,"" continued the Judge, ""we found a letter to her from you. She had, it seemed, arranged to meet you?"" The"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,4,"Count shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. ""Of what use are concealments,"" he said frankly. ""We are all men of the world. Privately and between ourselves, I admit the affair."" ""You met her in Paris and travelled down with her, I believe?"" said M. Carrège. ""That was the original arrangement, but by Madame's wish it was changed. I was to meet her at Hyères."" ""You did not meet her on the train at the Gare de Lyon on the evening of the 14th?"" ""On the contrary, I arrived in Nice on the morning of that day, so what you suggest is impossible."" ""Quite so, quite so,"" said M. Carrège. ""As a matter of form, you would perhaps give me an account of your movements during the evening and night of the 14th."" The Count reflected for a minute. ""I dined in Monte Carlo at the Café de Paris. Afterwards I went to the Le Sporting. I won a few thousand francs,"" he shrugged his shoulders. ""I returned home at perhaps one o'clock."" ""Pardon me, Monsieur, but how did you return home?"" ""In my own two-seater car."" ""No one was with you?"" ""No one."" ""You could produce witnesses in support of this statement?"" ""Doubtless many of my friends saw me there that evening. I dined alone."" ""Your servant admitted you on your return to your villa?"" ""I let myself in with my own latch-key."" ""Ah!"" murmured the Magistrate. Again he"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,5,"struck the bell on the table with his hand. The door opened, and a messenger appeared. ""Bring in the maid, Mason,"" said M. Carrège. ""Very good, Monsieur le Juge."" Ada Mason was brought in. ""Will you be so good, Mademoiselle, as to look at this gentleman. To the best of your ability was it he who entered your mistress's compartment in Paris?"" The woman looked long and searchingly at the Count, who was, Poirot fancied, rather uneasy under this scrutiny. ""I could not say, sir, I am sure,"" said Mason at last. ""It might be and again it might not. Seeing as how I only saw his back, it's hard to say. I rather think it _was_ the gentleman."" ""But you are not sure?"" ""No--o,"" said Mason unwillingly; ""n--no, I am not sure."" ""You have seen this gentleman before in Curzon Street?"" Mason shook her head. ""I should not be likely to see any visitors that come to Curzon Street,"" she explained, ""unless they were staying in the house."" ""Very well, that will do,"" said the Examining Magistrate sharply. Evidently he was disappointed. ""One moment,"" said Poirot. ""There is a question I would like to put to Mademoiselle, if I may?"" ""Certainly, M. Poirot--certainly, by all means."" Poirot addressed himself to the maid. ""What happened to the tickets?"" ""The tickets, sir?"" ""Yes; the tickets from London to Nice. Did you or your mistress have them?"" ""The mistress had her own Pullman"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,6,"ticket, sir; the others were in my charge."" ""What happened to them?"" ""I gave them to the conductor on the French train, sir; he said it was usual. I hope I did right, sir?"" ""Oh, quite right, quite right. A mere matter of detail."" Both M. Caux and the Examining Magistrate looked at him curiously. Mason stood uncertainly for a minute or two, and then the Magistrate gave her a brief nod of dismissal, and she went out. Poirot scribbled something on a scrap of paper and handed it across to M. Carrège. The latter read it and his brow cleared. ""Well, gentlemen,"" demanded the Count haughtily, ""am I to be detained further?"" ""Assuredly not, assuredly not,"" M. Carrège hastened to say, with a great deal of amiability. ""Everything is now cleared up as regards your own position in this affair. Naturally, in view of Madame's letter, we were bound to question you."" The Count rose, picked up his handsome stick from the corner, and, with rather a curt bow, left the room. ""And that is that,"" said M. Carrège. ""You were quite right, M. Poirot--much better to let him feel he is not suspected. Two of my men will shadow him night and day, and at the same time we will go into the question of the alibi. It seems to me rather--er--a fluid one."" ""Possibly,"" agreed Poirot thoughtfully. ""I asked M. Kettering to come here this morning,"" continued"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,7,"the Magistrate, ""though really I doubt if we have much to ask him, but there are one or two suspicious circumstances--"" He paused, rubbing his nose. ""Such as?"" asked Poirot. ""Well""--the Magistrate coughed--""this lady with whom he is said to be travelling--Mademoiselle Mirelle. She is staying at one hotel and he at another. That strikes me--er--as rather odd."" ""It looks,"" said M. Caux, ""as though they were being careful."" ""Exactly,"" said M. Carrège triumphantly; ""and what should they have to be careful about?"" ""An excess of caution is suspicious, eh?"" said Poirot. ""_Précisément._"" ""We might, I think,"" murmured Poirot, ""ask M. Kettering one or two questions."" The Magistrate gave instructions. A moment or two later, Derek Kettering, debonair as ever, entered the room. ""Good morning, Monsieur,"" said the Judge politely. ""Good morning,"" said Derek Kettering curtly. ""You sent for me. Has anything fresh turned up?"" ""Pray sit down, Monsieur."" Derek took a seat and flung his hat and stick on the table. ""Well?"" he asked impatiently. ""We have, so far, no fresh data,"" said M. Carrège cautiously. ""That's very interesting,"" said Derek drily. ""Did you send for me here in order to tell me that?"" ""We naturally thought, Monsieur, that you would like to be informed of the progress of the case,"" said the Magistrate severely. ""Even if the progress was non-existent."" ""We also wished to ask you a few questions."" ""Ask away."" ""You are quite sure that you neither"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,8,"saw nor spoke with your wife on the train?"" ""I've answered that already. I did not."" ""You had, no doubt, your reasons."" Derek stared at him suspiciously. ""I--did--not--know--she--was--on--the--train,"" he explained, spacing his words elaborately, as though to some one dull of intellect. ""That is what you say, yes,"" murmured M. Carrège. A frown suffused Derek's face. ""I should like to know what you're driving at. Do you know what I think, M. Carrège?"" ""What do you think, Monsieur?"" ""I think the French police are vastly overrated. Surely you must have some data as to these gangs of train robbers. It's outrageous that such a thing could happen on a _train de luxe_ like that, and that the French police should be helpless to deal with the matter."" ""We are dealing with it, Monsieur, never fear."" ""Madame Kettering, I understand, did not leave a will,"" interposed Poirot suddenly. His fingertips were joined together, and he was looking intently at the ceiling. ""I don't think she ever made one,"" said Kettering. ""Why?"" ""It is a very pretty little fortune that you inherit there,"" said Poirot--""a very pretty little fortune."" Although his eyes were still on the ceiling, he managed to see the dark flush that rose to Derek Kettering's face. ""What do you mean, and who are you?"" Poirot gently uncrossed his knees, withdrew his gaze from the ceiling, and looked the young man full in the face. ""My name is Hercule"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,9,"Poirot,"" he said quietly, ""and I am probably the greatest detective in the world. You are quite sure that you did not see or speak to your wife on that train?"" ""What are you getting at? Do you--do you mean to insinuate that I--I killed her?"" He laughed suddenly. ""I mustn't lose my temper; it's too palpably absurd. Why, if I killed her I should have had no need to steal her jewels, would I?"" ""That is true,"" murmured Poirot, with a rather crestfallen air. ""I did not think of that."" ""If ever there were a clear case of murder and robbery, this is it,"" said Derek Kettering. ""Poor Ruth, it was those damned rubies did for her. It must have got about she had them with her. There has been murder done for those same stones before now, I believe."" Poirot sat up suddenly in his chair. A very faint green light glowed in his eyes. He looked extraordinarily like a sleek, well-fed cat. ""One more question, M. Kettering,"" he said. ""Will you give me the date when you last saw your wife?"" ""Let me see,"" Kettering reflected. ""It must have been--yes over three weeks ago. I am afraid I can't give you the date exactly."" ""No matter,"" said Poirot drily; ""that is all I wanted to know."" ""Well,"" said Derek Kettering impatiently, ""anything further?"" He looked towards M. Carrège. The latter sought inspiration from Poirot, and received it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,17,17. An Aristocratic Gentleman,10,"in a very faint shake of the head. ""No, M. Kettering,"" he said politely; ""no, I do not think we need trouble you any further. I wish you good morning."" ""Good morning,"" said Kettering. He went out, banging the door behind him. Poirot leaned forward and spoke sharply, as soon as the young man was out of the room. ""Tell me,"" he said peremptorily, ""when did you speak of these rubies to M. Kettering?"" ""I have not spoken of them,"" said M. Carrège. ""It was only yesterday afternoon that we learnt about them from M. Van Aldin."" ""Yes; but there was a mention of them in the Comte's letter."" M. Carrège looked pained. ""Naturally I did not speak of that letter to M. Kettering,"" he said in a shocked voice. ""It would have been most indiscreet at the present juncture of affairs."" Poirot leaned forward and tapped the table. ""_Then how did he know about them?_"" he demanded softly. ""Madame could not have told him, for he has not seen her for three weeks. It seems unlikely that either M. Van Aldin or his secretary would have mentioned them; their interviews with him have been on entirely different lines, and there has not been any hint or reference to them in the newspapers."" He got up and took his hat and stick. ""And yet,"" he murmured to himself, ""our gentleman knows all about them. I wonder now, yes, I wonder!"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,1,"Derek Kettering went straight to the Negresco, where he ordered a couple of cocktails and disposed of them rapidly; then he stared moodily out over the dazzling blue sea. He noted the passers-by mechanically--a damned dull crowd, badly dressed, and painfully uninteresting; one hardly ever saw anything worth while nowadays. Then he corrected this last impression rapidly, as a woman placed herself at a table a little distance away from him. She was wearing a marvellous confection of orange and black, with a little hat that shaded"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,2,"her face. He ordered a third cocktail; again he stared out to sea, and then suddenly he started. A well-known perfume assailed his nostrils, and he looked up to see the orange-and-black lady standing beside him. He saw her face now, and recognized her. It was Mirelle. She was smiling that insolent, seductive smile he knew so well. ""Dereek!"" she murmured. ""You are pleased to see me, no?"" She dropped into a seat the other side of the table. ""But welcome me, then, stupid one,"" she mocked."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,3,"""This is an unexpected pleasure,"" said Derek. ""When did you leave London?"" She shrugged her shoulders. ""A day or two ago."" ""And the Parthenon?"" ""I have, how do you say it?--given them the chuck!"" ""Really?"" ""You are not very amiable, Dereek."" ""Do you expect me to be?"" Mirelle lit a cigarette and puffed at it for a few minutes before saying: ""You think, perhaps, that it is not prudent so soon?"" Derek stared at her, then he shrugged his shoulders, and remarked formally: ""You are lunching here?"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,4,"""_Mais oui._ I am lunching with you."" ""I am extremely sorry,"" said Derek. ""I have a very important engagement."" ""_Mon Dieu!_ But you men are like children,"" exclaimed the dancer. ""But yes, it is the spoilt child that you act to me ever since that day in London when you flung yourself out of my flat, you sulk. Ah! _mais c'est inoui!_"" ""My dear girl,"" said Derek, ""I really don't know what you are talking about. We agreed in London that rats desert a sinking ship, that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,5,"is all that there is to be said."" In spite of his careless words, his face looked haggard and strained. Mirelle leaned forward suddenly. ""You cannot deceive me,"" she murmured. ""I know--I know what you have done for me."" He looked up at her sharply. Some undercurrent in her voice arrested his attention. She nodded her head at him. ""Ah! have no fear; I am discreet. You are magnificent! You have a superb courage, but, all the same, it was I who gave you the idea"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,6,"that day, when I said to you in London that accidents sometimes happened. And you are not in danger? The police do not suspect you?"" ""What the devil--"" ""Hush!"" She held up a slim olive hand with one big emerald on the little finger. ""You are right; I should not have spoken so in a public place. We will not speak of the matter again, but our troubles are ended; our life together will be wonderful--wonderful!"" Derek laughed suddenly--a harsh, disagreeable laugh. ""So the rats come"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,7,"back, do they? Two million makes a difference--of course it does. I ought to have known that."" He laughed again. ""You will help me to spend that two million, won't you, Mirelle? You know how, no woman better."" He laughed again. ""Hush!"" cried the dancer. ""What is the matter with you, Dereek? See--people are turning to stare at you."" ""Me? I will tell you what is the matter. I have finished with you, Mirelle. Do you hear? Finished!"" Mirelle did not take it as he expected"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,8,"her to do. She looked at him for a minute or two, and then she smiled softly. ""But what a child! You are angry--you are sore, and all because I am practical. Did I not always tell you that I adored you?"" She leaned forward. ""But I know you, Dereek. Look at me--see, it is Mirelle who speaks to you. You cannot live without her, you know it. I loved you before, I will love you a hundred times more now. I will make life wonderful"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,9,"for you--but wonderful. There is no one like Mirelle."" Her eyes burned into his. She saw him grow pale and draw in his breath, and she smiled to herself contentedly. She knew her own magic and power over men. ""That is settled,"" she said softly, and gave a little laugh. ""And now, Dereek, will you give me lunch?"" ""No."" He drew in his breath sharply and rose to his feet. ""I am sorry, but I told you--I have got an engagement."" ""You are lunching with some"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,18,18. Derek Lunches,10,"one else? Bah! I don't believe it."" ""I am lunching with that lady over there."" He crossed abruptly to where a lady in white had just come up the steps. He addressed her a little breathlessly. ""Miss Grey, will you--will you have lunch with me? You met me at Lady Tamplin's, if you remember."" Katherine looked at him for a minute or two with those thoughtful grey eyes that said so much. ""Thank you,"" she said, after a moment's pause; ""I should like to very much."""

An Unexpected Visitor,1,"The Comte de la Roche had just finished _déjeuner_, consisting of an _omelette fines herbes_, an _entrecôte Béarnaise_, and a _Savarin au Rhum_. Wiping his fine black moustache delicately with his table napkin, the Comte rose from the table. He passed through the salon of the villa, noting with appreciation the few _objets d'art_ which were carelessly scattered about. The Louis XV snuff-box, the satin shoe worn by Marie Antoinette, and the other historic trifles were part of the Comte's _mise en scène_. They were, he would explain to his fair visitors, heirlooms in his family. Passing through on to the terrace, the Comte looked out on the Mediterranean with an unseeing eye. He was in no mood for appreciating the beauties of scenery. A fully matured scheme had been rudely brought to naught, and his plans had to be cast afresh. Stretching himself out in a basket chair, a cigarette held between his white fingers, the Comte pondered deeply. Presently Hippolyte, his man-servant, brought out coffee and a choice of liqueurs. The Comte selected some very fine old brandy. As the man-servant was preparing to depart, the Comte arrested him with a slight gesture. Hippolyte stood respectfully to attention. His countenance was hardly a prepossessing one, but the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,2,"correctitude of his demeanour went far to obliterate the fact. He was now the picture of respectful attention. ""It is possible,"" said the Comte, ""that in the course of the next few days various strangers may come to the house. They will endeavour to scrape acquaintance with you and with Marie. They will probably ask you various questions concerning me."" ""Yes, Monsieur le Comte."" ""Perhaps this has already happened?"" ""No, Monsieur le Comte."" ""There have been no strangers about the place? You are certain?"" ""There has been no one, Monsieur le Comte."" ""That is well,"" said the Comte drily; ""nevertheless they will come--I am sure of it. They will ask questions."" Hippolyte looked at his master in intelligent anticipation. The Comte spoke slowly, without looking at Hippolyte. ""As you know, I arrived here last Tuesday morning. If the police or any other inquirer should question you, do not forget that fact. I arrived on Tuesday, the 14th--not Wednesday, the 15th. You understand?"" ""Perfectly, Monsieur le Comte."" ""In an affair where a lady is concerned, it is always necessary to be discreet. I feel certain, Hippolyte, that you can be discreet."" ""I can be discreet, Monsieur."" ""And Marie?"" ""Marie also. I will answer for her."" ""That is well then,"" murmured"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,3,"the Comte. When Hippolyte had withdrawn, the Comte sipped his black coffee with a reflective air. Occasionally he frowned, once he shook his head slightly, twice he nodded it. Into the midst of these cogitations came Hippolyte once more. ""A lady, Monsieur."" ""A lady?"" The Comte was surprised. Not that a visit from a lady was an unusual thing at the Villa Marina, but at this particular moment the Comte could not think who the lady was likely to be. ""She is, I think, a lady not known to Monsieur,"" murmured the valet helpfully. The Comte was more and more intrigued. ""Show her out here, Hippolyte,"" he commanded. A moment later a marvellous vision in orange and black stepped out on the terrace, accompanied by a strong perfume of exotic blossoms. ""Monsieur le Comte de la Roche?"" ""At your service, Mademoiselle,"" said the Comte, bowing. ""My name is Mirelle. You may have heard of me."" ""Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle, but who has not been enchanted by the dancing of Mademoiselle Mirelle? Exquisite!"" The dancer acknowledged this compliment with a brief mechanical smile. ""My descent upon you is unceremonious,"" she began. ""But seat yourself, I beg of you, Mademoiselle,"" cried the Comte, bringing forward a chair. Behind the gallantry of his"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,4,"manner he was observing her narrowly. There were very few things that the Comte did not know about women. True, his experience had not lain much in ladies of Mirelle's class, who were themselves predatory. He and the dancer were, in a sense, birds of a feather. His arts, the Comte knew, would be thrown away on Mirelle. She was a Parisienne, and a shrewd one. Nevertheless, there was one thing that the Comte could recognize infallibly when he saw it. He knew at once that he was in the presence of a very angry woman, and an angry woman, as the Comte was well aware, always says more than is prudent, and is occasionally a source of profit to a level-headed gentleman who keeps cool. ""It is most amiable of you, Mademoiselle, to honour my poor abode thus."" ""We have mutual friends in Paris,"" said Mirelle. ""I have heard of you from them, but I come to see you to-day for another reason. I have heard of you since I came to Nice--in a different way, you understand."" ""Ah?"" said the Comte softly. ""I will be brutal,"" continued the dancer; ""nevertheless, believe that I have your welfare at heart. They are saying in Nice, Monsieur le Comte, that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,5,"you are the murderer of the English lady, Madame Kettering."" ""I!--the murderer of Madame Kettering? Bah! But how absurd!"" He spoke more languidly than indignantly, knowing that he would thus provoke her further. ""But yes,"" she insisted; ""it is as I tell you."" ""It amuses people to talk,"" murmured the Comte indifferently. ""It would be beneath me to take such wild accusations seriously."" ""You do not understand."" Mirelle bent forward, her dark eyes flashing. ""It is not the idle talk of those in the streets. It is the police."" ""The police--ah?"" The Comte sat up, alert once more. Mirelle nodded her head vigorously several times. ""Yes, yes. You comprehend me--I have friends every where. The Prefect himself--"" She left the sentence unfinished, with an eloquent shrug of the shoulders. ""Who is not indiscreet where a beautiful woman is concerned?"" murmured the Count politely. ""The police believe that you killed Madame Kettering. But they are wrong."" ""Certainly they are wrong,"" agreed the Comte easily. ""You say that, but you do not know the truth. I do."" The Comte looked at her curiously. ""You know who killed Madame Kettering? Is that what you would say, Mademoiselle?"" Mirelle nodded vehemently. ""Yes."" ""Who was it?"" asked the Comte sharply. ""Her husband."" She bent"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,6,"nearer to the Comte, speaking in a low voice that vibrated with anger and excitement. ""It was her husband who killed her."" The Comte leant back in his chair. His face was a mask. ""Let me ask you, Mademoiselle--how do you know this?"" ""How do I know it?"" Mirelle sprang to her feet, with a laugh. ""He boasted of it beforehand. He was ruined, bankrupt, dishonoured. Only the death of his wife could save him. He told me so. He travelled on the same train--but she was not to know it. Why was that, I ask you? So that he might creep upon her in the night--Ah!""--she shut her eyes--""I can see it happening...."" The Count coughed. ""Perhaps--perhaps,"" he murmured. ""But surely, Mademoiselle, in that case he would not steal the jewels?"" ""The jewels!"" breathed Mirelle. ""The jewels. Ah! Those rubies...."" Her eyes grew misty, a far-away light in them. The Comte looked at her curiously, wondering for the hundredth time at the magical influence of precious stones on the female sex. He recalled her to practical matters. ""What do you want me to do, Mademoiselle?"" Mirelle became alert and business-like once more. ""Surely it is simple. You will go to the police. You will say to them that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,7,"M. Kettering committed this crime."" ""And if they do not believe me? If they ask for proof?"" He was eyeing her closely. Mirelle laughed softly, and drew her orange-and-black wrap closer round her. ""Send them to me, Monsieur le Comte,"" she said softly; ""I will give them the proof they want."" Upon that she was gone, an impetuous whirlwind, her errand accomplished. The Comte looked after her, his eyebrows delicately raised. ""She is in a fury,"" he murmured. ""What has happened now to upset her? But she shows her hand too plainly. Does she really believe that Mr. Kettering killed his wife? She would like me to believe it. She would even like the police to believe it."" He smiled to himself. He had no intention whatsoever of going to the police. He saw various other possibilities, to judge by his smile, an agreeable vista of them. Presently, however, his brow clouded. According to Mirelle, he was suspected by the police. That might be true or it might not. An angry woman of the type of the dancer was not likely to bother about the strict veracity of her statements. On the other hand, she might easily have obtained--inside information. In that case--his mouth set grimly--in that case he"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,8,"must take certain precautions. He went into the house and questioned Hippolyte closely once more as to whether any strangers had been to the house. The valet was positive in his assurances that this was not the case. The Comte went up to his bedroom and crossed over to an old bureau that stood against the wall. He let down the lid of this, and his delicate fingers sought for a spring at the back of one of the pigeon-holes. A secret drawer flew out; in it was a small brown paper package. The Comte took this out and weighed it in his hand carefully for a minute or two. Raising his hand to his head, with a slight grimace he pulled out a single hair. This he placed on the lip of the drawer and shut it carefully. Still carrying the small parcel in his hand, he went downstairs and out of the house to the garage, where stood a scarlet two-seater car. Ten minutes later he had taken the road for Monte Carlo. He spent a few hours at the Casino, then sauntered out into the town. Presently he re-entered the car and drove off in the direction of Mentone. Earlier in the afternoon he had noticed"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,9,"an inconspicuous grey car some little distance behind him. He noticed it again now. He smiled to himself. The road was climbing steadily upwards. The Comte's foot pressed hard on the accelerator. The little red car had been specially built to the Comte's design, and had a far more powerful engine than would have been suspected from its appearance. It shot ahead. Presently he looked back and smiled; the grey car was following behind. Smothered in dust, the little red car leaped along the road. It was travelling now at a dangerous pace, but the Comte was a first-class driver. Now they were going down hill, twisting and curving unceasingly. Presently the car slackened speed, and finally came to a standstill before a Bureau de Poste. The Comte jumped out, lifted the lid of the tool chest, extracted the small brown paper parcel and hurried into the post office. Two minutes later he was driving once more in the direction of Mentone. When the grey car arrived there, the Comte was drinking English five o'clock tea on the terrace of one of the hotels. Later, he drove back to Monte Carlo, dined there, and reached home once more at eleven o'clock. Hippolyte came out to meet him with a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,19,19. An Unexpected Visitor,10,"disturbed face. ""Ah! Monsieur le Comte has arrived. Monsieur le Comte did not telephone me, by any chance?"" The Comte shook his head. ""And yet at three o'clock I received a summons from Monsieur le Comte, to present myself to him at Nice, at the Negresco."" ""Really,"" said the Comte; ""and you went?"" ""Certainly, Monsieur, but at the Negresco they knew nothing of Monsieur le Comte. He had not been there."" ""Ah,"" said the Comte, ""doubtless at that hour Marie was out doing her afternoon marketing?"" ""That is so, Monsieur le Comte."" ""Ah, well,"" said the Comte, ""it is of no importance. A mistake."" He went upstairs, smiling to himself. Once within his own room, he bolted his door and looked sharply round. Everything seemed as usual. He opened various drawers and cupboards. Then he nodded to himself. Things had been replaced almost exactly as he had left them, but not quite. It was evident that a very thorough search had been made. He went over to the bureau and pressed the hidden spring. The drawer flew open, but the hair was no longer where he had placed it. He nodded his head several times. ""They are excellent, our French police,"" he murmured to himself--""excellent. Nothing escapes them."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,1,"On the following morning Katherine and Lenox were sitting on the terrace of the Villa Marguerite. Something in the nature of a friendship was springing up between them, despite the difference in age. But for Lenox, Katherine would have found life at the Villa Marguerite quite intolerable. The Kettering case was the topic of the moment. Lady Tamplin frankly exploited her guest's connection with the affair for all it was worth. The most persistent rebuffs that Katherine could administer quite failed to pierce Lady Tamplin's self-esteem. Lenox adopted a detached attitude, seemingly amused at her mother's manœuvres, and yet with a sympathetic understanding of Katherine's feelings. The situation was not helped by Chubby, whose naïve delight was unquenchable, and who introduced Katherine to all and sundry as: ""This is Miss Grey. You know that Blue Train business? She was in it up to the ears! Had a long talk with Ruth Kettering a few hours before the murder! Bit of luck for her, eh?"" A few remarks of this kind had provoked"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,2,"Katherine that morning to an unusually tart rejoinder, and when they were alone together Lenox observed in her slow drawl: ""Not used to exploitation, are you? You have a lot to learn, Katherine."" ""I am sorry I lost my temper. I don't, as a rule."" ""It is about time you learnt to blow off steam. Chubby is only an ass; there is no harm in him. Mother, of course, is trying, but you can lose your temper with her until Kingdom come, and it won't make any impression. She will open large, sad blue eyes at you and not care a bit."" Katherine made no reply to this filial observation, and Lenox presently went on: ""I am rather like Chubby. I delight in a good murder, and besides--well, knowing Derek makes a difference."" Katherine nodded. ""So you lunched with him yesterday,"" pursued Lenox reflectively. ""Do you like him, Katherine?"" Katherine considered for a minute or two. ""I don't know,"" she said very slowly. ""He is very attractive."" ""Yes, he is attractive."" ""What"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,3,"don't you like about him?"" Katherine did not reply to the question, or at any rate not directly. ""He spoke of his wife's death,"" she said. ""He said he would not pretend that it had been anything but a bit of most marvellous luck for him."" ""And that shocked you, I suppose,"" said Lenox. She paused, and then added in rather a queer tone of voice: ""He likes you, Katherine."" ""He gave me a very good lunch,"" said Katherine, smiling. Lenox refused to be side-tracked. ""I saw it the night he came here,"" she said thoughtfully. ""The way he looked at you; and you are not his usual type--just the opposite. Well, I suppose it is like religion--you get it at a certain age."" ""Mademoiselle is wanted at the telephone,"" said Marie, appearing at the window of the salon. ""M. Hercule Poirot desires to speak with her."" ""More blood and thunder. Go on, Katherine; go and dally with your detective."" M. Hercule Poirot's voice came neat and precise in its intonation to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,4,"Katherine's ear. ""That is Mademoiselle Grey who speaks? _Bon._ Mademoiselle, I have a word for you from M. Van Aldin, the father of Madame Kettering. He wishes very much to speak with you, either at the Villa Marguerite or at his hotel, whichever you prefer."" Katherine reflected for a moment, but she decided that for Van Aldin to come to the Villa Marguerite would be both painful and unnecessary. Lady Tamplin would have hailed his advent with far too much delight. She never lost a chance of cultivating millionaires. She told Poirot that she would much rather come to Nice. ""Excellent, Mademoiselle. I will call for you myself in an auto. Shall we say in about three-quarters of an hour?"" Punctually to the moment Poirot appeared. Katherine was waiting for him, and they drove off at once. ""Well, Mademoiselle, how goes it?"" She looked at his twinkling eyes, and was confirmed in her first impression that there was something very attractive about M. Hercule Poirot. ""This is our own Roman Policier, is"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,5,"it not?"" said Poirot. ""I made you the promise that we should study it together. And me, I always keep my promises."" ""You are too kind,"" murmured Katherine. ""Ah, you mock yourself at me; but do you want to hear the developments of the case, or do you not?"" Katherine admitted that she did, and Poirot proceeded to sketch for her a thumbnail portrait of the Comte de la Roche. ""You think he killed her,"" said Katherine thoughtfully. ""That is the theory,"" said Poirot guardedly. ""Do you yourself believe that?"" ""I did not say so. And you, Mademoiselle, what do you think?"" Katherine shook her head. ""How should I know? I don't know anything about those things, but I should say that--"" ""Yes,"" said Poirot encouragingly. ""Well--from what you say the Count does not sound the kind of man who would actually kill anybody."" ""Ah! Very good,"" cried Poirot, ""you agree with me; that is just what I have said."" He looked at her sharply. ""But tell me, you have met Mr."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,6,"Derek Kettering?"" ""I met him at Lady Tamplin's, and I lunched with him yesterday."" ""A _mauvais sujet_,"" said Poirot, shaking his head; ""but _les femmes_--they like that, eh?"" He twinkled at Katherine and she laughed. ""He is the kind of man one would notice anywhere,"" continued Poirot. ""Doubtless you observed him on the Blue Train?"" ""Yes, I noticed him."" ""In the restaurant car?"" ""No. I didn't notice him at meals at all. I only saw him once--going into his wife's compartment."" Poirot nodded. ""A strange business,"" he murmured. ""I believe you said you were awake, Mademoiselle, and looked out of your window at Lyons? You saw no tall dark man such as the Comte de la Roche leave the train?"" Katherine shook her head. ""I don't think I saw any one at all,"" she said. ""There was a youngish lad in a cap and overcoat who got out, but I don't think he was leaving the train, only walking up and down the platform. There was a fat Frenchman with a beard,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,7,"in pyjamas and an overcoat, who wanted a cup of coffee. Otherwise, I think there were only the train attendants."" Poirot nodded his head several times. ""It is like this, you see,"" he confided, ""the Comte de la Roche has an alibi. An alibi, it is a very pestilential thing, and always open to the gravest suspicion. But here we are!"" They went straight up to Van Aldin's suite, where they found Knighton. Poirot introduced him to Katherine. After a few commonplaces had been exchanged, Knighton said, ""I will tell Mr. Van Aldin that Miss Grey is here."" He went through a second door into an adjoining room. There was a low murmur of voices, and then Van Aldin came into the room and advanced towards Katherine with outstretched hand, giving her at the same time a shrewd and penetrating glance. ""I am pleased to meet you, Miss Grey,"" he said simply. ""I have been wanting very badly to hear what you can tell me about Ruth."" The quiet simplicity of the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,8,"millionaire's manner appealed to Katherine strongly. She felt herself in the presence of a very genuine grief, the more real for its absence of outward sign. He drew forward a chair. ""Sit here, will you, and just tell me all about it."" Poirot and Knighton retired discreetly into the other room, and Katherine and Van Aldin were left alone together. She found no difficulty in her task. Quite simply and naturally she related her conversation with Ruth Kettering, word for word as nearly as she could. He listened in silence, leaning back in his chair, with one hand shading his eyes. When she had finished he said quietly: ""Thank you, my dear."" They both sat silent for a minute or two. Katherine felt that words of sympathy would be out of place. When the millionaire spoke, it was in a different tone: ""I am very grateful to you, Miss Grey. I think you did something to ease my poor Ruth's mind in the last hours of her life. Now I want"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,9,"to ask you something. You know--M. Poirot will have told you--about the scoundrel that my poor girl had got herself mixed up with. He was the man of whom she spoke to you--the man she was going to meet. In your judgment do you think she might have changed her mind after her conversation with you? Do you think she meant to go back on her word?"" ""I can't honestly tell you. She had certainly come to some decision, and seemed more cheerful in consequence of it."" ""She gave you no idea where she intended to meet the skunk--whether in Paris or at Hyères?"" Katherine shook her head. ""She said nothing as to that."" ""Ah!"" said Van Aldin thoughtfully, ""and that is the important point. Well, time will show."" He got up and opened the door of the adjoining room. Poirot and Knighton came back. Katherine declined the millionaire's invitation to lunch, and Knighton went down with her and saw her into the waiting car. He returned to find Poirot and"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,20,20. Katherine Makes a Friend,10,"Van Aldin deep in conversation. ""If we only knew,"" said the millionaire thoughtfully, ""what decision Ruth came to. It might have been any of half a dozen. She might have meant to leave the train at Paris and cable to me. She may have meant to have gone on to the south of France and have an explanation with the Count there. We are in the dark--absolutely in the dark. But we have the maid's word for it that she was both startled and dismayed at the Count's appearance at the station in Paris. That was clearly not part of the preconceived plan. You agree with me, Knighton?"" The secretary started. ""I beg your pardon, Mr. Van Aldin. I was not listening."" ""Day-dreaming, eh?"" said Van Aldin. ""That's not like you. I believe that girl has bowled you over."" Knighton blushed. ""She is a remarkably nice girl,"" said Van Aldin thoughtfully, ""very nice. Did you happen to notice her eyes?"" ""Any man,"" said Knighton, ""would be bound to notice her eyes."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,1,"Several days had elapsed. Katherine had been for a walk by herself one morning, and came back to find Lenox grinning at her expectantly. ""Your young man has been ringing you up, Katherine!"" ""Who do you call my young man?"" ""A new one--Rufus Van Aldin's secretary. You seem to have made rather an impression there. You are becoming a serious breaker of hearts, Katherine. First Derek Kettering, and now this young Knighton. The funny thing is, that I remember him quite well. He was in Mother's War Hospital that she ran out here. I was only a kid of about eight at the time."" ""Was he badly wounded?"" ""Shot in the leg, if I remember rightly--rather a nasty business. I think the doctors messed it up a bit. They said he wouldn't limp or anything, but when he left here he was still completely dot and go one."" Lady Tamplin came out and joined them. ""Have you been telling Katherine about Major Knighton?"" she asked. ""Such a dear fellow! Just at first I didn't remember him--one had so many--but now it all comes back."" ""He was a bit too unimportant to be remembered before,"" said Lenox. ""Now that he is a secretary to an American millionaire, it is a very different matter."" ""Darling!"" said Lady Tamplin in her vague reproachful voice. ""What did Major Knighton ring up about?"" inquired Katherine. ""He asked if you would like to go to the tennis this afternoon. If so, he would call for you in a car. Mother and I accepted for you with _empressement_. Whilst you dally with a millionaire's secretary, you might give me a chance with the millionaire, Katherine."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,2,"He is about sixty, I suppose, so that he will be looking about for a nice sweet young thing like me."" ""I should like to meet Mr. Van Aldin,"" said Lady Tamplin earnestly; ""one has heard so much of him. Those fine rugged figures of the Western world""--she broke off--""so fascinating,"" she murmured. ""Major Knighton was very particular to say it was Mr. Van Aldin's invitation,"" said Lenox. ""He said it so often that I began to smell a rat. You and Knighton would make a very nice pair, Katherine. Bless you, my children!"" Katherine laughed, and went upstairs to change her clothes. Knighton arrived soon after lunch and endured manfully Lady Tamplin's transports of recognition. When they were driving together towards Cannes he remarked to Katherine: ""Lady Tamplin has changed wonderfully little."" ""In manner or appearance?"" ""Both. She must be, I suppose, well over forty, but she is a remarkably beautiful woman still."" ""She is,"" agreed Katherine. ""I am very glad that you could come to-day,"" went on Knighton. ""M. Poirot is going to be there also. What an extraordinary little man he is. Do you know him well, Miss Grey?"" Katherine shook her head. ""I met him on the train on the way here. I was reading a detective novel, and I happened to say something about such things not happening in real life. Of course, I had no idea of who he was."" ""He is a very remarkable person,"" said Knighton slowly, ""and has done some very remarkable things. He has a kind of genius for going to the root of the matter, and right up to the end no one has any idea of"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,3,"what he is really thinking. I remember I was staying at a house in Yorkshire, and Lady Clanravon's jewels were stolen. It seemed at first to be a simple robbery, but it completely baffled the local police. I wanted them to call in Hercule Poirot, and said he was the only man who could help them, but they pinned their faith to Scotland Yard."" ""And what happened?"" said Katherine curiously. ""The jewels were never recovered,"" said Knighton drily. ""You really do believe in him?"" ""I do indeed. The Comte de la Roche is a pretty wily customer. He has wriggled out of most things. But I think he has met his match in Hercule Poirot."" ""The Comte de la Roche,"" said Katherine thoughtfully; ""so you really think he did it?"" ""Of course."" Knighton looked at her in astonishment. ""Don't you?"" ""Oh yes,"" said Katherine hastily; ""that is, I mean, if it was not just an ordinary train robbery."" ""It might be, of course,"" agreed the other, ""but it seems to me that the Comte de la Roche fits into this business particularly well."" ""And yet he has an alibi."" ""Oh, alibis!"" Knighton laughed, his face broke into his attractive boyish smile. ""You confess that you read detective stories, Miss Grey. You must know that any one who has a perfect alibi is always open to grave suspicion."" ""Do you think that real life is like that?"" asked Katherine, smiling. ""Why not? Fiction is founded on fact."" ""But is rather superior to it,"" suggested Katherine. ""Perhaps. Anyway, if I was a criminal I should not like to have Hercule Poirot on my track."" ""No more should I,"" said Katherine,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,4,"and laughed. They were met on arrival by Poirot. As the day was warm he was attired in a white duck suit, with a white camellia in his buttonhole. ""_Bon jour_, Mademoiselle,"" said Poirot. ""I look very English, do I not?"" ""You look wonderful,"" said Katherine tactfully. ""You mock yourself at me,"" said Poirot genially, ""but no matter. Papa Poirot, he always laughs the last."" ""Where is Mr. Van Aldin?"" asked Knighton. ""He will meet us at our seats. To tell you the truth, my friend, he is not too well pleased with me. Oh, those Americans--the repose, the calm, they know it not! Mr. Van Aldin, he would that I fly myself in the pursuit of criminals through all the byways of Nice."" ""I should have thought myself that it would not have been a bad plan,"" observed Knighton. ""You are wrong,"" said Poirot; ""in these matters one needs not energy but finesse. At the tennis one meets every one. That is so important. Ah, there is Mr. Kettering."" Derek came abruptly up to them. He looked reckless and angry, as though something had arisen to upset him. He and Knighton greeted each other with some frigidity. Poirot alone seemed unconscious of any sense of strain, and chatted pleasantly in a laudable attempt to put every one at his ease. He paid little compliments. ""It is amazing, M. Kettering, how well you speak the French,"" he observed--""so well that you could be taken for a Frenchman if you chose. That is a very rare accomplishment among Englishmen."" ""I wish I did,"" said Katherine. ""I am only too well aware that my French is of a painfully British"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,5,"order."" They reached their seats and sat down, and almost immediately Knighton perceived his employer signaling to him from the other end of the court, and went off to speak to him. ""Me, I approve of that young man,"" said Poirot, sending a beaming smile after the departing secretary; ""and you, Mademoiselle?"" ""I like him very much."" ""And you, M. Kettering?"" Some quick rejoinder was springing to Derek's lips, but he checked it as though something in the little Belgian's twinkling eyes had made him suddenly alert. He spoke carefully, choosing his words. ""Knighton is a very good fellow,"" he said. Just for a moment Katherine fancied that Poirot looked disappointed. ""He is a great admirer of yours, M. Poirot,"" she said, and she related some of the things that Knighton had said. It amused her to see the little man plume himself like a bird, thrusting out his chest, and assuming an air of mock modesty that would have deceived no one. ""That reminds me, Mademoiselle,"" he said suddenly, ""I have a little matter of business I have to speak to you about. When you were sitting talking to that poor lady in the train, I think you must have dropped a cigarette case."" Katherine looked rather astonished. ""I don't think so,"" she said. Poirot drew from his pocket a cigarette case of soft blue leather, with the initial ""K"" on it in gold. ""No, that is not mine,"" Katherine said. ""Ah, a thousand apologies. It was doubtless Madame's own. 'K,' of course, stands for Kettering. We were doubtful, because she had another cigarette case in her bag, and it seemed odd that she should have two."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,6,"He turned to Derek suddenly. ""You do not know, I suppose, whether this was your wife's case or not?"" Derek seemed momentarily taken aback. He stammered a little in his reply: ""I--I don't know. I suppose so."" ""It is not yours by any chance?"" ""Certainly not. If it were mine it would hardly have been in my wife's possession."" Poirot looked more ingenuous and childlike than ever. ""I thought perhaps you might have dropped it when you were in your wife's compartment,"" he explained guilelessly. ""I never was there. I have already told the police that a dozen times."" ""A thousand pardons,"" said Poirot, with his most apologetic air. ""It was Mademoiselle here who mentioned having seen you going in."" He stopped with an air of embarrassment. Katherine looked at Derek. His face had gone rather white, but perhaps that was her fancy. His laugh, when it came, was natural enough. ""You made a mistake, Miss Grey,"" he said easily. ""From what the police have told me, I gather that my own compartment was only a door or two away from that of my wife's--though I never suspected the fact at the time. You must have seen me going into my own compartment."" He got up quickly as he saw Van Aldin and Knighton approaching. ""I'm going to leave you now,"" he announced. ""I can't stand my father-in-law at any price."" Van Aldin greeted Katherine very courteously, but was clearly in a bad humour. ""You seem fond of watching tennis, M. Poirot,"" he growled. ""It is a pleasure to me, yes,"" cried Poirot placidly. ""It is as well you are in France,"" said Van Aldin. ""We are made"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,7,"of sterner stuff in the States. Business comes before pleasure there."" Poirot did not take offence; indeed, he smiled gently and confidingly at the irate millionaire. ""Do not enrage yourself, I beg of you. Every one has his own methods. Me, I have always found it a delightful and pleasing idea to combine business and pleasure together."" He glanced at the other two. They were deep in conversation, absorbed in each other. Poirot nodded his head in satisfaction, and then leant towards the millionaire, lowering his voice as he did so. ""It is not only for pleasure that I am here, M. Van Aldin. Observe just opposite us that tall old man--the one with the yellow face and the venerable beard."" ""Well, what of him?"" ""That,"" Poirot said, ""is M. Papopolous."" ""A Greek, eh?"" ""As you say--a Greek. He is a dealer in antiques of world-wide reputation. He has a small shop in Paris, and he is suspected by the police of being something more."" ""What?"" ""A receiver of stolen goods, especially jewels. There is nothing as to the re-cutting and re-setting of gems that he does not know. He deals with the highest in Europe and with the lowest of the riff-raff of the underworld."" Van Aldin was looking at Poirot with suddenly awakened attention. ""Well?"" he demanded, a new note in his voice. ""I ask myself,"" said Poirot, ""I, Hercule Poirot""--he thumped himself dramatically on the chest--""ask myself _why is M. Papopolous suddenly come to Nice?_"" Van Aldin was impressed. For a moment he had doubted Poirot and suspected the little man of being past his job, a _poseur_ only. Now, in a moment, he switched"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,8,"back to his original opinion. He looked straight at the little detective. ""I must apologize to you, M. Poirot."" Poirot waved the apology aside with an extravagant gesture. ""Bah!"" he cried, ""all that is of no importance. Now listen, M. Van Aldin; I have news for you."" The millionaire looked sharply at him, all his interest aroused. Poirot nodded. ""It is as I say. You will be interested. As you know, M. Van Aldin, the Comte de la Roche has been under surveillance ever since his interview with the Juge d'Instruction. The day after that, during his absence, the Villa Marina was searched by the police."" ""Well,"" said Van Aldin, ""did they find anything? I bet they didn't."" Poirot made him a little bow. ""Your acumen is not at fault, M. Van Aldin. They found nothing of an incriminating nature. It was not to be expected that they would. The Comte de la Roche, as your expressive idiom has it, was not born on the preceding day. He is an astute gentleman with great experience."" ""Well, go on,"" growled Van Aldin. ""It may be, of course, that the Comte had nothing of a compromising nature to conceal. But we must not neglect the possibility. If, then, he has something to conceal, where is it? Not in his house--the police searched thoroughly. Not on his person, for he knows that he is liable to arrest at any minute. There remains--his car. As I say, he was under surveillance. He was followed on that day to Monte Carlo. From there he went by road to Mentone, driving himself. His car is a very powerful one, it outdistanced his pursuers,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,9,"and for about a quarter of an hour they completely lost sight of him."" ""And during that time you think he concealed something by the roadside?"" asked Van Aldin, keenly interested. ""By the roadside, no. _Ça n'est pas pratique._ But listen now--me, I have made a little suggestion to M. Carrège. He is graciously pleased to approve of it. In each Bureau de Poste in the neighbourhood it has been seen to that there is some one who knows the Comte de la Roche by sight. Because, you see, Monsieur, the best way of hiding a thing is by sending it away by the post."" ""Well?"" demanded Van Aldin; his face was keenly alight with interest and expectation. ""Well--_voilà!_"" With a dramatic flourish Poirot drew out from his pocket a loosely wrapped brown paper package from which the string had been removed. ""During that quarter of an hour's interval, our good gentleman mailed this."" ""The address?"" asked the other sharply. Poirot nodded his head. ""Might have told us something, but unfortunately it does not. The package was addressed to one of these little newspaper shops in Paris where letters and parcels are kept until called for on payment of a small commission."" ""Yes, but what is inside?"" demanded Van Aldin impatiently. Poirot unwrapped the brown paper and disclosed a square cardboard box. He looked round him. ""It is a good moment,"" he said quietly. ""All eyes are on the tennis. Look, Monsieur!"" He lifted the lid of the box for the fraction of a second. An exclamation of utter astonishment came from the millionaire. His face turned as white as chalk. ""My God!"" he breathed, ""the rubies."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,21,21. At the Tennis,10,"He sat for a minute as though dazed. Poirot restored the box to his pocket and beamed placidly. Then suddenly the millionaire seemed to come out of his trance; he leaned across to Poirot and wrung his hand so heartily that the little man winced with pain. ""This is great,"" said Van Aldin. ""Great! You are the goods, M. Poirot. Once and for all, you are the goods."" ""It is nothing,"" said Poirot modestly. ""Order, method, being prepared for eventualities beforehand--that is all there is to it."" ""And now, I suppose, the Comte de la Roche has been arrested?"" continued Van Aldin eagerly. ""No,"" said Poirot. A look of utter astonishment came over Van Aldin's face. ""But why? What more do you want?"" ""The Comte's alibi is still unshaken."" ""But that is nonsense."" ""Yes,"" said Poirot; ""I rather think it is nonsense, but unfortunately we have to prove it so."" ""In the meantime he will slip through your fingers."" Poirot shook his head very energetically. ""No,"" he said, ""he will not do that. The one thing the Comte cannot afford to sacrifice is his social position. At all costs he must stop and brazen it out."" Van Aldin was still dissatisfied. ""But I don't see--"" Poirot raised a hand. ""Grant me a little moment, Monsieur. Me, I have a little idea. Many people have mocked themselves at the little ideas of Hercule Poirot--and they have been wrong."" ""Well,"" said Van Aldin, ""go ahead. What is this little idea?"" Poirot paused for a moment and then he said: ""I will call upon you at your hotel at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning. Until then, say nothing to any one."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,1,"M. Papopolous was at breakfast. Opposite him sat his daughter, Zia. There was a knock at the sitting-room door, and a chasseur entered with a card which he brought to Mr. Papopolous. The latter scrutinized it, raised his eyebrows, and passed it over to his daughter. ""Ah!"" said M. Papopolous, scratching his left ear thoughtfully, ""Hercule Poirot. I wonder now."" Father and daughter looked at each other. ""I saw him yesterday at the tennis,"" said M. Papopolous. ""Zia, I hardly like this."" ""He was very useful to you once,"" his daughter reminded him. ""That is true,"" acknowledged M. Papopolous; ""also he has retired from active work, so I hear."" These interchanges between father and daughter had passed in their own language. Now M. Papopolous turned to the chasseur and said in French: ""_Faites monter ce monsieur._"" A few minutes later Hercule Poirot, exquisitely attired, and swinging a cane with a jaunty air, entered"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,2,"the room. ""My dear M. Papopolous."" ""My dear M. Poirot."" ""And Mademoiselle Zia."" Poirot swept her a low bow. ""You will excuse us going on with our breakfast,"" said M. Papopolous, pouring himself out another cup of coffee. ""Your call is--ahem!--a little early."" ""It is scandalous,"" said Poirot, ""but see you, I am pressed."" ""Ah!"" murmured M. Papopolous, ""you are on an affair then?"" ""A very serious affair,"" said Poirot: ""the death of Madame Kettering."" ""Let me see,"" M. Papopolous looked innocently up at the ceiling, ""that was the lady who died on the Blue Train, was it not? I saw a mention of it in the papers, but there was no suggestion of foul play."" ""In the interests of justice,"" said Poirot, ""it was thought best to suppress that fact."" There was a pause. ""And in what way can I assist you, M. Poirot?"" asked the dealer politely. ""_Voilà_,"" said Poirot,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,3,"""I shall come to the point."" He took from his pocket the same box that he had displayed at Cannes, and opening it, he took out the rubies and pushed them across the table to Papopolous. Although Poirot was watching him narrowly, not a muscle of the old man's face moved. He took up the jewels and examined them with a kind of detached interest, then he looked across at the detective inquiringly: ""Superb, are they not?"" asked Poirot. ""Quite excellent,"" said M. Papopolous. ""How much should you say they are worth?"" The Greek's face quivered a little. ""Is it really necessary to tell you, M. Poirot?"" he asked. ""You are shrewd, M. Papopolous. No, it is not. They are not, for instance, worth five hundred thousand dollars."" Papopolous laughed, and Poirot joined with him. ""As an imitation,"" said Papopolous, handing them back to Poirot, ""they are, as I said, quite excellent."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,4,"Would it be indiscreet to ask, M. Poirot, where you came across them?"" ""Not at all,"" said Poirot; ""I have no objection to telling an old friend like yourself. They were in the possession of the Comte de la Roche."" M. Papopolous' eyebrows lifted themselves eloquently. ""In-deed,"" he murmured. Poirot leant forward and assumed his most innocent and beguiling air. ""M. Papopolous,"" he said, ""I am going to lay my cards upon the table. The original of these jewels was stolen from Madame Kettering on the Blue Train. Now I will say to you first this: _I am not concerned with the recovery of these jewels. That is the affair of the police._ I am working not for the police but for M. Van Aldin. I want to lay hands on the man who killed Madame Kettering. I am interested in the jewels only in so far as they may lead me"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,5,"to the man. You understand?"" The last two words were uttered with great significance. M. Papopolous, his face quite unmoved, said quietly: ""Go on."" ""It seems to me probable, Monsieur, that the jewels will change hands in Nice--may already have done so."" ""Ah!"" said M. Papopolous. He sipped his coffee reflectively, and looked a shade more noble and patriarchal than usual. ""I say to myself,"" continued Poirot, with animation, ""what good fortune! My old friend, M. Papopolous, is in Nice. He will aid me."" ""And how do you think I can aid you?"" inquired M. Papopolous coldly. ""I said to myself, without doubt M. Papopolous is in Nice on business."" ""Not at all,"" said M. Papopolous, ""I am here for my health--by the doctor's orders."" He coughed hollowly. ""I am desolated to hear it,"" replied Poirot, with somewhat insincere sympathy. ""But to continue. When a Russian Grand Duke, an Austrian Archduchess, or"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,6,"an Italian Prince wish to dispose of their family jewels--to whom do they go? To M. Papopolous, is it not? He who is famous all over the world for the discretion with which he arranges these things."" The other bowed. ""You flatter me."" ""It is a great thing, discretion,"" mused Poirot, and was rewarded by the fleeting smile which passed across the Greek's face. ""I, too, can be discreet."" The eyes of the two men met. Then Poirot went on speaking very slowly, and obviously picking his words with care. ""I say to myself, this: if these jewels have changed hands in Nice, M. Papopolous would have heard of it. He has knowledge of all that passes in the jewel world."" ""Ah!"" said M. Papopolous, and helped himself to a _croissant_. ""The police, you understand,"" said M. Poirot, ""do not enter into the matter. It is a personal affair."" ""One hears rumours,"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,7,"admitted M. Papopolous cautiously. ""Such as?"" prompted Poirot. ""Is there any reason why I should pass them on?"" ""Yes,"" said Poirot, ""I think there is. You may remember, M. Papopolous, that seventeen years ago there was a certain article in your hands, left there as security by a very--er--Prominent Person. It was in your keeping and it unaccountably disappeared. You were, if I may use the English expression, in the soup."" His eyes came gently round to the girl. She had pushed her cup and plate aside, and with both elbows on the table and her chin resting on her hands was listening eagerly. Still keeping an eye on her he went on: ""I am in Paris at the time. You send for me. You place yourself in my hands. If I restore to you that--article, you say I shall earn your undying gratitude. _Eh bien!_ I did restore it to you."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,8,"A long sigh came from M. Papopolous. ""It was the most unpleasant moment of my career,"" he murmured. ""Seventeen years is a long time,"" said Poirot thoughtfully, ""but I believe that I am right in saying, Monsieur, that your race does not forget."" ""A Greek?"" murmured Papopolous, with an ironical smile. ""It was not as a Greek I meant,"" said Poirot. There was a silence, and then the old man drew himself up proudly. ""You are right, M. Poirot,"" he said quietly. ""I am a Jew. And, as you say, our race does not forget."" ""You will aid me then?"" ""As regards the jewels, Monsieur, I can do nothing."" The old man, as Poirot had done just now, picked his words carefully. ""I know nothing. I have heard nothing. But I can perhaps do you a good turn--that is, if you are interested in racing."" ""Under certain circumstances I might be,"" said"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,9,"Poirot, eyeing him steadily. ""There is a horse running at Longchamps that would, I think, repay attention. I cannot say for certain, you understand; this news passed through so many hands."" He stopped, fixing Poirot with his eye, as though to make sure that the latter was comprehending him. ""Perfectly, perfectly,"" said Poirot, nodding. ""The name of the horse,"" said M. Papopolous, leaning back and joining the tips of his fingers together, ""is the Marquis. I think, but I am not sure, that it is an English horse, eh, Zia?"" ""I think so too,"" said the girl. Poirot got up briskly. ""I thank you, Monsieur,"" he said. ""It is a great thing to have what the English call a tip from the stable. Au revoir, Monsieur, and many thanks."" He turned to the girl. ""Au revoir, Mademoiselle Zia. It seems to me but yesterday that I saw you in Paris. One would"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,22,22. M. Papopolous Breakfasts,10,"say that two years had passed at most."" ""There is a difference between sixteen and thirty-three,"" said Zia ruefully. ""Not in your case,"" declared Poirot gallantly. ""You and your father will perhaps dine with me one night."" ""We shall be delighted,"" replied Zia. ""Then we will arrange it,"" declared Poirot, ""and now--_je me sauve_."" Poirot walked along the street humming a little tune to himself. He twirled his stick with a jaunty air, once or twice he smiled to himself quietly. He turned into the first Bureau de Poste he came to and sent off a telegram. He took some time in wording it, but it was in code and he had to call upon his memory. It purported to deal with a missing scarf-pin, and was addressed to Inspector Japp, Scotland Yard. Decoded, it was short and to the point. ""_Wire me everything known about man whose soubriquet is the Marquis._"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,1,"It was exactly eleven o'clock when Poirot presented himself at Van Aldin's hotel. He found the millionaire alone. ""You are punctual, M. Poirot,"" he said, with a smile, as he rose to greet the detective. ""I am always punctual,"" said Poirot. ""The exactitude--always do I observe it. Without order and method--"" He broke off. ""Ah, but it is possible that I have said these things to you before. Let us come at once to the object of my visit."" ""Your little idea?"" ""Yes, my little idea."" Poirot smiled. ""First of all, Monsieur. I should like to interview once more the maid, Ada Mason. She is"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,2,"here?"" ""Yes, she's here."" ""Ah!"" Van Aldin looked at him curiously. He rang the bell, and a messenger was dispatched to find Mason. Poirot greeted her with his usual politeness, which was never without effect on that particular class. ""Good afternoon, Mademoiselle,"" he said cheerfully. ""Be seated, will you not, if Monsieur permits."" ""Yes, yes, sit down, my girl,"" said Van Aldin. ""Thank you, sir,"" said Mason primly, and she sat down on the extreme edge of a chair. She looked bonier and more acid than ever. ""I have come to ask you yet more questions,"" said Poirot. ""We must get to the bottom of"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,3,"this affair. Always I return to the question of the man in the train. You have been shown the Comte de la Roche. You say that it is possible he was the man, but you are not sure."" ""As I told you, sir, I never saw the gentleman's face. That is what makes it so difficult."" Poirot beamed and nodded. ""Precisely, exactly. I comprehend well the difficulty. Now, Mademoiselle, you have been in the service of Madame Kettering two months, you say. During that time, how often did you see your master?"" Mason reflected a minute or two, and then said: ""Only twice, sir."" ""And"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,4,"was that near to, or far away?"" ""Well once, sir, he came to Curzon Street. I was upstairs, and I looked over the banisters and saw him in the hall below. I was a bit curious like, you understand, knowing the way things--er--were."" Mason finished up with her discreet cough. ""And the other time?"" ""I was in the Park, sir, with Annie--one of the housemaids, sir, and she pointed out the master to me walking with a foreign lady."" Again Poirot nodded. ""Now listen, Mason, this man whom you saw in the carriage talking to your mistress at the Gare de Lyon, how do you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,5,"know it was not your master?"" ""The master, sir? Oh, I don't think it could have been."" ""But you are not sure,"" Poirot persisted. ""Well--I never thought of it, sir."" Mason was clearly upset at the idea. ""You have heard that your master was also on the train. What more natural than that it should be he who came along the corridor."" ""But the gentleman who was talking to the mistress must have come from outside, sir. He was dressed for the street. In an overcoat and soft hat."" ""Just so, Mademoiselle, but reflect a minute. The train has just arrived at the Gare de"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,6,"Lyon. Many of the passengers promenade themselves upon the quay. Your mistress was about to do so, and for that purpose had doubtless put on her fur coat, eh?"" ""Yes, sir,"" agreed Mason. ""Your master, then, does the same. The train is heated, but outside in the station it is cold. He puts on his overcoat and his hat and he walks along beside the train, and looking up at the lighted windows he suddenly sees Madame Kettering. Until then he has had no idea that she was on the train. Naturally, he mounts the carriage and goes to her compartment. She gives an exclamation"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,7,"of surprise at seeing him and quickly shuts the door between the two compartments since it is possible that their conversation may be of a private nature."" He leaned back in his chair and watched the suggestion slowly take effect. No one knew better than Hercule Poirot that the class to which Mason belongs cannot be hurried. He must give her time to get rid of her own preconceived ideas. At the end of three minutes she spoke: ""Well, of course, sir, it might be so. I never thought of it that way. The master is tall and dark, and just about that build. It"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,8,"was seeing the hat and coat that made me say it was a gentleman from outside. Yes, it might have been the master. I would not like to say either way, I am sure."" ""Thank you very much, Mademoiselle. I shall not require you any further. Ah, just one thing more."" He took from his pocket the cigarette case he had already shown to Katherine. ""Is that your mistress's case?"" he said to Mason. ""No, sir, it is not the mistress's--at least--"" She looked suddenly startled. An idea was clearly working its way to the forefront of her mind. ""Yes,"" said Poirot encouragingly. ""I think,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,9,"sir--I can't be sure, but I think--it is a case that the mistress bought to give to the master."" ""Ah,"" said Poirot in a non-committal manner. ""But whether she ever did give it to him or not, I can't say, of course."" ""Precisely,"" said Poirot, ""precisely. That is all, I think, Mademoiselle. I wish you good afternoon."" Ada Mason retired discreetly, closing the door noiselessly behind her. Poirot looked across at Van Aldin, a faint smile upon his face. The millionaire looked thunderstruck. ""You think--you think it was Derek?"" he queried, ""but--everything points the other way. Why, the Count has actually been caught redhanded with"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,23,23. A New Theory,10,"the jewels on him."" ""No."" ""But you told me--"" ""What did I tell you?"" ""That story about the jewels. You showed them to me."" ""No."" Van Aldin stared at him. ""You mean to say you didn't show them to me."" ""No."" ""Yesterday--at the tennis?"" ""No."" ""Are you crazy, M. Poirot, or am I?"" ""Neither of us is crazy,"" said the detective. ""You ask me a question; I answer it. You say have I not shown you the jewels yesterday? I reply--no. What I showed you, M. Van Aldin, was a first-class imitation, hardly to be distinguished except by an expert from the real ones."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,1,"It took the millionaire some few minutes to take the thing in. He stared at Poirot as though dumbfounded. The little Belgian nodded at him gently. ""Yes,"" he said, ""it alters the position, does it not?"" ""Imitation!"" He leaned forward. ""All along, M. Poirot, you have had this idea? All along this is what you have been driving at? You never believed that the Comte de la Roche was the murderer?"" ""I have had doubts,"" said Poirot quietly. ""I said as much to you. Robbery with violence and murder""--he shook his head energetically--""no, it is difficult to picture. It does not harmonize with the personality of the Comte de la Roche."" ""But you believe that he meant to steal the rubies?"" ""Certainly. There is no doubt as to that. See, I will recount to you the affair as I see it. The Comte knew of the rubies and he laid his plans accordingly. He made up a romantic story of a book he was writing, so as to induce your daughter to bring them with her. He provided himself with"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,2,"an exact duplicate. It is clear, is it not, that substitution is what he was after. Madame, your daughter, was not an expert on jewels. It would probably be a long time before she discovered what had occurred. When she did so--well--I do not think she would prosecute the Comte. Too much would come out. He would have in his possession various letters of hers. Oh yes, a very safe scheme from the Comte's point of view--one that he has probably carried out before."" ""It seems clear enough, yes,"" said Van Aldin musingly. ""It accords with the personality of the Comte de la Roche,"" said Poirot. ""Yes, but now--"" Van Aldin looked searchingly at the other. ""What actually happened? Tell me that, M. Poirot."" Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""It is quite simple,"" he said; ""some one stepped in ahead of the Comte."" There was a long pause. Van Aldin seemed to be turning things over in his mind. When he spoke it was without beating about the bush. ""How long have you suspected my son-in-law, M. Poirot?"" ""From the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,3,"very first. He had the motive and the opportunity. Every one took for granted that the man in Madame's compartment in Paris was the Comte de la Roche. I thought so, too. Then you happened to mention that you had once mistaken the Comte for your son-in-law. That told me that they were of the same height and build, and alike in colouring. It put some curious ideas in my head. The maid had only been with your daughter a short time. It was unlikely that she would know Mr. Kettering well by sight, since he had not been living in Curzon Street; also the man was careful to keep his face turned away."" ""You believe he--murdered her,"" said Van Aldin hoarsely. Poirot raised a hand quickly. ""No, no, I did not say that--but it is a possibility--a very strong possibility. He was in a tight corner, a very tight corner, threatened with ruin. This was the one way out."" ""But why take the jewels?"" ""To make the crime appear an ordinary one committed by train robbers. Otherwise suspicion"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,4,"might have fallen on him straight away."" ""If that is so, what has he done with the rubies?"" ""That remains to be seen. There are several possibilities. There is a man in Nice who may be able to help, the man I pointed out at the tennis."" He rose to his feet and Van Aldin rose also and laid his hand on the little man's shoulder. His voice when he spoke was harsh with emotion. ""Find Ruth's murderer for me,"" he said, ""that is all I ask."" Poirot drew himself up. ""Leave it in the hands of Hercule Poirot,"" he said superbly; ""have no fears. I will discover the truth."" He brushed a speck of fluff from his hat, smiled reassuringly at the millionaire, and left the room. Nevertheless, as he went down the stairs some of the confidence faded from his face. ""It is all very well,"" he murmured to himself, ""but there are difficulties. Yes, there are great difficulties."" As he was passing out of the hotel he came to a sudden halt. A car had drawn"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,5,"up in front of the door. In it was Katherine Grey, and Derek Kettering was standing beside it talking to her earnestly. A minute or two later the car drove off and Derek remained standing on the pavement looking after it. The expression on his face was an odd one. He gave a sudden impatient gesture of the shoulders, sighed deeply, and turned to find Hercule Poirot standing at his elbow. In spite of himself he started. The two men looked at each other. Poirot steadily and unwaveringly and Derek with a kind of light-hearted defiance. There was a sneer behind the easy mockery of his tone when he spoke, raising his eyebrows slightly as he did so. ""Rather a dear, isn't she?"" he asked easily. His manner was perfectly natural. ""Yes,"" said Poirot thoughtfully, ""that describes Mademoiselle Katherine very well. It is very English, that phrase there, and Mademoiselle Katherine, she also is very English."" Derek remained perfectly still without answering. ""And yet she is _sympathique_, is it not so?"" ""Yes,"" said Derek; ""there are not many like"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,6,"her."" He spoke softly, almost as though to himself. Poirot nodded significantly. Then he leant towards the other and spoke in a different tone, a quiet, grave tone that was new to Derek Kettering. ""You will pardon an old man, Monsieur, if he says to you something that you may consider impertinent. There is one of your English proverbs that I would quote to you. It says that 'it is well to be off with the old love, before being on with the new.'"" Kettering turned on him angrily. ""What the devil do you mean?"" ""You enrage yourself at me,"" said Poirot placidly. ""I expected as much. As to what I mean--I mean, Monsieur, that there is a second car with a lady in it. If you turn your head you will see her."" Derek spun round. His face darkened with anger. ""Mirelle, damn her!"" he muttered. ""I will soon--"" Poirot arrested the movement he was about to make. ""Is it wise what you are about to do there?"" he asked warningly. His eyes shone softly with a green"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,7,"light in them. But Derek was past noticing the warning signs. In his anger he was completely off his guard. ""I have broken with her utterly, and she knows it,"" cried Derek angrily. ""You have broken with her, yes, but has _she_ broken with you?"" Derek gave a sudden harsh laugh. ""She won't break with two million pounds if she can help it,"" he murmured brutally; ""trust Mirelle for that."" Poirot raised his eyebrows. ""You have the outlook cynical,"" he murmured. ""Have I?"" There was no mirth in his sudden wide smile. ""I have lived in the world long enough, M. Poirot, to know that all women are pretty much alike."" His face softened suddenly. ""All save one."" He met Poirot's gaze defiantly. A look of alertness crept into his eyes, then faded again. ""That one,"" he said, and jerked his head in the direction of Cap Martin. ""Ah!"" said Poirot. This quiescence was well calculated to provoke the impetuous temperament of the other. ""I know what you are going to say,"" said Derek rapidly, ""the kind of life"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,8,"I have led, the fact that I am not worthy of her. You will say that I have no right to think even of such a thing. You will say that it is not a case of giving a dog a bad name--I know that it is not decent to be speaking like this with my wife dead only a few days, and murdered at that."" He paused for breath, and Poirot took advantage of the pause to remark in his plaintive tone: ""But, indeed, I have not said anything at all."" ""But you will."" ""Eh?"" said Poirot. ""You will say that I have no earthly chance of marrying Katherine."" ""No,"" said Poirot, ""I would not say that. Your reputation is bad, yes, but with women--never does that deter them. If you were a man of excellent character, of strict morality who had done nothing that he should not do, and--possibly everything that he should do--_eh bien!_ then I should have grave doubts of your success. Moral worth, you understand, it is not romantic. It is appreciated, however, by"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,9,"widows."" Derek Kettering stared at him, then he swung round on his heel and went up to the waiting car. Poirot looked after him with some interest. He saw the lovely vision lean out of the car and speak. Derek Kettering did not stop. He lifted his hat and passed straight on. ""_Ça y est_,"" said M. Hercule Poirot, ""it is time, I think, that I return _chez moi_."" He found the imperturbable George pressing trousers. ""A pleasant day, Georges, somewhat fatiguing, but not without interest,"" he said. George received these remarks in his usual wooden fashion. ""Indeed, sir."" ""The personality of a criminal, Georges, is an interesting matter. Many murderers are men of great personal charm."" ""I always heard, sir, that Dr. Crippen was a pleasant-spoken gentleman. And yet he cut up his wife like so much mincemeat."" ""Your instances are always apt, Georges."" The valet did not reply, and at that moment the telephone rang. Poirot took up the receiver. ""'Allo--'allo--yes, yes, it is Hercule Poirot who speaks."" ""This is Knighton. Will you hold the line a"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,24,24. Poirot Gives Advice,10,"minute, M. Poirot? Mr. Van Aldin would like to speak to you."" There was a moment's pause, then the millionaire's voice came through. ""Is that you, M. Poirot? I just wanted to tell you that Mason came to me now of her own accord. She has been thinking it over, and she says that she is almost certain that the man at Paris was Derek Kettering. There was something familiar about him at the time, she says, but at the minute she could not place it. She seems pretty certain now."" ""Ah,"" said Poirot, ""thank you, M. Van Aldin. That advances us."" He replaced the receiver, and stood for a minute or two with a very curious smile on his face. George had to speak to him twice before obtaining an answer. ""Eh?"" said Poirot. ""What is that that you say to me?"" ""Are you lunching here, sir, or are you going out?"" ""Neither,"" said Poirot, ""I shall go to bed and take a _tisane_. The expected has happened, and when the expected happens, it always causes me emotion."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,1,"As Derek Kettering passed the car, Mirelle leant out. ""Dereek--I must speak to you for a moment--"" But, lifting his hat, Derek passed straight on without stopping. When he got back to his hotel, the concierge detached himself from his wooden pen and accosted him. ""A gentleman is waiting to see you, Monsieur."" ""Who is it?"" asked Derek. ""He did not give me his name, Monsieur, but he said his business with you was important, and that he would wait."" ""Where is he?"" ""In the little salon, Monsieur. He preferred it to the lounge he said, as being more private."" Derek nodded, and turned his steps in that direction. The small salon was empty except for the visitor, who rose and bowed with easy foreign grace as Derek entered. As it chanced, Derek had seen the Comte de la Roche only once, but found no difficulty in recognizing that aristocratic nobleman, and he frowned angrily. Of all the consummate impertinence! ""The Comte de la Roche, is it not?"" he said. ""I am afraid you have wasted your time in coming here."" ""I hope not,"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,2,"said the Comte agreeably. His white teeth glittered. The Comte's charm of manner was usually wasted on his own sex. All men, without exception, disliked him heartily. Derek Kettering was already conscious of a distinct longing to kick the Count bodily out of the room. It was only the realization that scandal would be unfortunate just at present that restrained him. He marvelled anew that Ruth could have cared, as she certainly had, for this fellow. A bounder, and worse than a bounder. He looked with distaste at the Count's exquisitely manicured hands. ""I called,"" said the Comte, ""on a little matter of business. It would be advisable, I think, for you to listen to me."" Again Derek felt strongly tempted to kick him out, but again he refrained. The hint of a threat was not lost upon him, but he interpreted it in his own way. There were various reasons why it would be better to hear what the Comte had to say. He sat down and drummed impatiently with his fingers on the table. ""Well,"" he said sharply, ""what is it?"" It"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,3,"was not the Comte's way to come out into the open at once. ""Allow me, Monsieur, to offer you my condolences on your recent bereavement."" ""If I have any impertinence from you,"" said Derek quietly, ""you go out by that window."" He nodded his head towards the window beside the Comte, and the latter moved uneasily. ""I will send my friends to you, Monsieur, if that is what you desire,"" he said haughtily. Derek laughed. ""A duel, eh? My dear Count, I don't take you seriously enough for that. But I should take a good deal of pleasure in kicking you down the Promenade des Anglais."" The Comte was not at all anxious to take offence. He merely raised his eyebrows and murmured: ""The English are barbarians."" ""Well,"" said Derek, ""what is it you have to say to me?"" ""I will be frank,"" said the Comte, ""I will come immediately to the point. That will suit us both, will it not?"" Again he smiled in his agreeable fashion. ""Go on,"" said Derek curtly. The Comte looked at the ceiling, joined the tips of his"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,4,"fingers together, and murmured softly: ""You have come into a lot of money, Monsieur."" ""What the devil has that got to do with you?"" The Comte drew himself up. ""Monsieur, my name is tarnished! I am suspected--accused--of foul crime."" ""The accusation does not come from me,"" said Derek coldly; ""as an interested party I have not expressed any opinion."" ""I am innocent,"" said the Comte, ""I swear before heaven""--he raised his hand to heaven--""that I am innocent."" ""M. Carrège is, I believe, the Juge d'Instruction in charge of the case,"" hinted Derek politely. The Comte took no notice. ""Not only am I unjustly suspected of a crime that I did not commit, but I am also in serious need of money."" He coughed softly and suggestively. Derek rose to his feet. ""I was waiting for that,"" he said softly; ""you blackmailing brute! I will not give you a penny. My wife is dead, and no scandal that you can make can touch her now. She wrote you foolish letters, I dare say. If I were to buy them from you for a round"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,5,"sum at this minute, I am pretty certain that you would manage to keep one or two back; and I will tell you this, M. de la Roche, blackmailing is an ugly word both in England and in France. That is my answer to you. Good afternoon."" ""One moment""--the Comte stretched out a hand as Derek was turning to leave the room. ""You are mistaken, Monsieur. You are completely mistaken. I am, I hope, a 'gentleman.'"" Derek laughed. ""Any letters that a lady might write to me I should hold sacred."" He flung back his head with a beautiful air of nobility. ""The proposition that I was putting before you was of quite a different nature. I am, as I said, extremely short of money, and my conscience might impel me to go to the police with certain information."" Derek came slowly back into the room. ""What do you mean?"" The Comte's agreeable smile flashed forth once more. ""Surely it is not necessary to go into details,"" he purred. ""Seek whom the crime benefits, they say, don't they? As I said just now,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,6,"you have come into a lot of money lately."" Derek laughed. ""If that is all--"" he said contemptuously. But the Comte was shaking his head. ""But it is not all, my dear sir. I should not come to you unless I had much more precise and detailed information than that. It is not agreeable, Monsieur, to be arrested and tried for murder."" Derek came close up to him. His face expressed such furious anger that involuntarily the Comte drew back a pace or two. ""Are you threatening _me_?"" the young man demanded angrily. ""You shall hear nothing more of the matter,"" the Comte assured him. ""Of all the colossal bluffs that I have ever struck--"" The Comte raised a white hand. ""You are wrong. It is not a bluff. To convince you I will tell you this. My information was obtained from a certain lady. It is she who holds the irrefutable proof that you committed the murder."" ""She? Who?"" ""Mademoiselle Mirelle."" Derek drew back as though struck. ""Mirelle,"" he muttered. The Comte was quick to press what he took to be his"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,7,"advantage. ""A bagatelle of one hundred thousand francs,"" he said. ""I ask no more."" ""Eh?"" said Derek absently. ""I was saying, Monsieur, that a bagatelle of one hundred thousand francs would satisfy my--conscience."" Derek seemed to recollect himself. He looked earnestly at the Comte. ""You would like my answer now?"" ""If you please, Monsieur."" ""Then here it is. You can go to the devil. See?"" Leaving the Comte too astonished to speak, Derek turned on his heel and swung out of the room. Once out of the hotel he hailed a taxi and drove to Mirelle's hotel. On inquiring, he learned that the dancer had just come in. Derek gave the concierge his card. ""Take this up to Mademoiselle and ask if she will see me."" A very brief interval elapsed, and then Derek was bidden to follow a _chasseur_. A wave of exotic perfume assailed Derek's nostrils as he stepped over the threshold of the dancer's apartments. The room was filled with carnations, orchids, and mimosa. Mirelle was standing by the window in a _peignoir_ of foamy lace. She came towards him,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,8,"her hands outstretched. ""Dereek--you have come to me. I knew you would."" He put aside the clinging arms and looked down on her sternly. ""Why did you send the Comte de la Roche to me?"" She looked at him in astonishment, which he took to be genuine. ""I? Send the Comte de la Roche to you? But for what?"" ""Apparently--for blackmail,"" said Derek grimly. Again she stared. Then suddenly she smiled and nodded her head. ""Of course. It was to be expected. It is what he would do, _ce type là_. I might have known it. No, indeed, Dereek, I did not send him."" He looked at her piercingly, as though seeking to read her mind. ""I will tell you,"" said Mirelle. ""I am ashamed, but I will tell you. The other day, you comprehend, I was mad with rage, quite mad--"" she made an eloquent gesture. ""My temperament, it is not a patient one. I want to be revenged on you, and so I go to the Comte de la Roche, and I tell him to go to the police and say"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,9,"so and so, and so and so. But have no fear, Dereek. Not completely did I lose my head; the proof rests with me alone. The police can do nothing without my word, you understand? And now--now?"" She nestled up close to him, looking up at him with melting eyes. He thrust her roughly away from him. She stood there, her breast heaving, her eyes narrowing to a cat-like slit. ""Be careful, Dereek, be very careful. You have come back to me, have you not?"" ""I shall never come back to you,"" said Derek steadily. ""Ah!"" More than ever the dancer looked like a cat. Her eyelids flickered. ""So there is another woman? The one with whom you lunched that day. Eh! am I right?"" ""I intend to ask that lady to marry me. You might as well know."" ""That prim Englishwoman! Do you think that I will support that for one moment? Ah, no."" Her beautiful lithe body quivered. ""Listen, Dereek, do you remember that conversation we had in London? You said the only thing that could save you was the death"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,25,25. Defiance,10,"of your wife. You regretted that she was so healthy. Then the idea of an accident came to your brain. And more than an accident."" ""I suppose,"" said Derek contemptuously, ""that it was this conversation that you repeated to the Comte de la Roche."" Mirelle laughed. ""Am I a fool? Could the police do anything with a vague story like that? See--I will give you a last chance. You shall give up this Englishwoman. You shall return to me. And then, _chéri_, never, never will I breathe--"" ""Breathe what?"" She laughed softly. ""You thought no one saw you--"" ""What do you mean?"" ""As I say, you thought no one saw you--but _I_ saw you, Dereek, _mon ami_; _I saw you coming out of the compartment of Madame your wife just before the train got into Lyons that night._ _And_ I know more than that. I know that when you came out of her compartment she was dead."" He stared at her. Then, like a man in a dream he turned very slowly and went out of the room, swaying slightly as he walked."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,1,"""And so it is,"" said Poirot, ""that we are the good friends and have no secrets from each other."" Katherine turned her head to look at him. There was something in his voice, some undercurrent of seriousness, which she had not heard before. They were sitting in the gardens of Monte Carlo. Katherine had come over with her friends, and they had run into Knighton and Poirot almost immediately on arrival. Lady Tamplin had seized upon Knighton and had overwhelmed him with reminiscences, most of which Katherine had a faint suspicion were invented. They had moved away together, Lady Tamplin with her hand on the young man's arm. Knighton had thrown a couple of glances back over his shoulder, and Poirot's eyes twinkled a little as he saw them. ""Of course we are friends,"" said Katherine. ""From the beginning we have been sympathetic to each other,"" mused Poirot. ""When you told me that a 'Roman Policier' occurs in real life."" ""And I was right, was I not?"" he challenged her, with an emphatic forefinger. ""Here we are, plunged in the middle of one. That is natural for me--it is my _métier_--but for you it is different. Yes,"" he added in a reflective tone, ""for you it is different."" She looked sharply at him. It was as though he were warning her, pointing out to her some menace"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,2,"that she had not seen. ""Why do you say that I am in the middle of it? It is true that I had that conversation with Mrs. Kettering just before she died, but now--now all that is over. I am not connected with the case any more."" ""Ah, Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle, can we ever say, 'I have finished with this or that'?"" Katherine turned defiantly round to face him. ""What is it?"" she asked. ""You are trying to tell me something--to convey it to me rather. But I am not clever at taking hints. I would much rather that you said anything you have to say straight out."" Poirot looked at her sadly. ""_Ah, mais c'est Anglais ça_,"" he murmured, ""everything in black and white, everything clear cut and well defined. But life, it is not like that, Mademoiselle. There are the things that are not yet, but which cast their shadow before."" He dabbed his brow with a very large silk pocket-handkerchief and murmured: ""Ah, but it is that I become poetical. Let us, as you say, speak only of facts. And, speaking of facts, tell me what you think of Major Knighton."" ""I like him very much indeed,"" said Katherine warmly; ""he is quite delightful."" Poirot sighed. ""What is the matter?"" asked Katherine. ""You reply so heartily,"" said Poirot. ""If you had said in an indifferent"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,3,"voice, 'Oh, quite nice,' _eh bien_, do you know I should have been better pleased."" Katherine did not answer. She felt slightly uncomfortable. Poirot went on dreamily: ""And yet, who knows? With _les femmes_, they have so many ways of concealing what they feel--and heartiness is perhaps as good a way as any other."" He sighed. ""I don't see--"" began Katherine. He interrupted her. ""You do not see why I am being so impertinent, Mademoiselle? I am an old man, and now and then--not very often--I come across some one whose welfare is dear to me. We are friends, Mademoiselle. You have said so yourself. And it is just this--I should like to see you happy."" Katherine stared very straight in front of her. She had a cretonne sunshade with her, and with its point she traced little designs in the gravel at her feet. ""I have asked you a question about Major Knighton, now I will ask you another. Do you like Mr. Derek Kettering?"" ""I hardly know him,"" said Katherine. ""That is not an answer, that."" ""I think it is."" He looked at her, struck by something in her tone. Then he nodded his head gravely and slowly. ""Perhaps you are right, Mademoiselle. See you, I who speak to you have seen much of the world, and I know that there are two things which"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,4,"are true. A good man may be ruined by his love for a bad woman--but the other way holds good also. A bad man may equally be ruined by his love for a good woman."" Katherine looked up sharply. ""When you say ruined--"" ""I mean from his point of view. One must be wholehearted in crime as in everything else."" ""You are trying to warn me,"" said Katherine in a low voice. ""Against whom?"" ""I cannot look into your heart, Mademoiselle; I do not think you would let me if I could. I will just say this. There are men who have a strange fascination for women."" ""The Comte de la Roche,"" said Katherine, with a smile. ""There are others--more dangerous than the Comte de la Roche. They have qualities that appeal--recklessness, daring, audacity. You are fascinated, Mademoiselle; I see that, but I think that it is no more than that. I hope so. This man of whom I speak, the emotion he feels is genuine enough, but all the same--"" ""Yes?"" He got up and stood looking down at her. Then he spoke, in a low, distinct voice: ""You could, perhaps, love a thief, Mademoiselle, _but not a murderer_."" He wheeled sharply away on that and left her sitting there. He heard the little gasp she gave and paid no attention. He had said what he"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,5,"meant to say. He left her there to digest that last unmistakable phrase. Derek Kettering, coming out of the Casino into the sunshine, saw her sitting alone on the bench and joined her. ""I have been gambling,"" he said, with a light laugh, ""gambling unsuccessfully. I have lost everything--everything, that is, that I have with me."" Katherine looked at him with a troubled face. She was aware at once of something new in his manner, some hidden excitement that betrayed itself in a hundred different infinitesimal signs. ""I should think you were always a gambler. The spirit of gambling appeals to you."" ""Every day and in every way a gambler? You are about right. Don't _you_ find something stimulating in it? To risk all on one throw--there is nothing like it."" Calm and stolid as she believed herself to be, Katherine felt a faint answering thrill. ""I want to talk to you,"" went on Derek, ""and who knows when I may have another opportunity? There is an idea going about that I murdered my wife--no, please don't interrupt. It is absurd, of course."" He paused for a minute or two, then went on, speaking more deliberately. ""In dealing with the police and Local Authorities here I have had to pretend to--well--a certain decency. I prefer not to pretend with you. I meant to marry money. I was"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,6,"on the lookout for money when I first met Ruth Van Aldin. She had the look of a slim Madonna about her, and I--well--I made all sorts of good resolutions--and was bitterly disillusioned. My wife was in love with another man when she married me. She never cared for me in the least. Oh, I am not complaining; the thing was a perfectly respectable bargain. She wanted Leconbury and I wanted money. The trouble arose simply through Ruth's American blood. Without caring a pin for me, she would have liked me to be continually dancing attendance. Time and again she as good as told me that she had bought me and that I belonged to her. The result was that I behaved abominably to her. My father-in-law will tell you that, and he is quite right. At the time of Ruth's death, I was faced with absolute disaster."" He laughed suddenly. ""One _is_ faced with absolute disaster when one is up against a man like Rufus Van Aldin."" ""And then?"" asked Katherine in a low voice. ""And then,"" Derek shrugged his shoulders, ""Ruth was murdered--very providentially."" He laughed, and the sound of his laugh hurt Katherine. She winced. ""Yes,"" said Derek, ""that wasn't in very good taste. But it is quite true. Now I am going to tell you something more. From the very first moment I"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,7,"saw you I knew you were the only woman in the world for me. I was--afraid of you. I thought you might bring me bad luck."" ""Bad luck?"" said Katherine sharply. He stared at her. ""Why do you repeat it like that? What have you got in your mind?"" ""I was thinking of things that people have said to me."" Derek grinned suddenly. ""They will say a lot to you about me, my dear, and most of it will be true. Yes, and worse things too--things that I shall never tell you. I have been a gambler always--and I have taken some long odds. I shan't confess to you now or at any other time. The past is done with. There is one thing I do wish you to believe. I swear to you solemnly that I did not kill my wife."" He said the words earnestly enough, yet there was somehow a theatrical touch about them. He met her troubled gaze and went on: ""I know. I lied the other day. It _was_ my wife's compartment I went into."" ""Ah,"" said Katherine. ""It's difficult to explain just why I went in, but I'll try. I did it on an impulse. You see, I was more or less spying on my wife. I kept out of sight on the train. Mirelle had told me that my wife"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,8,"was meeting the Comte de la Roche in Paris. Well, as far as I had seen, that was not so. I felt ashamed, and I thought suddenly that it would be a good thing to have it out with her once and for all, so I pushed open the door and went in."" He paused. ""Yes,"" said Katherine gently. ""Ruth was lying on the bunk asleep--her face was turned away from me--I could see only the back of her head. I could have waked her up, of course. But suddenly I felt a reaction. What, after all, was there to say that we hadn't both of us said a hundred times before? She looked so peaceful lying there. I left the compartment as quietly as I could."" ""Why lie about it to the police?"" asked Katherine. ""Because I'm not a complete fool. I've realized from the beginning that, from the point of view of motive, I'm the ideal murderer. If I once admitted that I had been in her compartment just before she was murdered, I'd do for myself once and for all."" ""I see."" Did she see? She could not have told herself. She was feeling the magnetic attraction of Derek's personality, but there was something in her that resisted, that held back.... ""Katherine--"" ""I--"" ""You know that I care for you. Do--do you care for"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,9,"me?"" ""I--I don't know."" Weakness there. Either she knew or she did not know. If--if only-- She cast a look round desperately as though seeking something that would help her. A soft colour rose in her cheeks as a tall fair man with a limp came hurrying along the path towards them--Major Knighton. There was relief and an unexpected warmth in her voice as she greeted him. Derek stood up scowling, his face black as a thundercloud. ""Lady Tamplin having a flutter?"" he said easily. ""I must join her and give her the benefit of my system."" He swung round on his heel and left them together. Katherine sat down again. Her heart was beating rapidly and unevenly, but as she sat there talking commonplaces to the quiet, rather shy man beside her, her self-command came back. Then she realized with a shock that Knighton also was laying bare his heart, much as Derek had done, but in a very different manner. He was shy and stammering. The words came haltingly with no eloquence to back them. ""From the first moment I saw you--I--I ought not to have spoken so soon--but Mr. Van Aldin may leave here any day, and I might not have another chance. I know you can't care for me so soon--that is impossible. I dare say it is presumption anyway on my part."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,26,26. A Warning,10,"I have private means, but not very much--no, please don't answer now. I know what your answer would be. But in case I went away suddenly I just wanted you to know--that I care."" She was shaken--touched. His manner was so gentle and appealing. ""There's one thing more. I just wanted to say that if--if you are ever in trouble, anything that I can do--"" He took her hand in his, held it tightly for a minute, then dropped it and walked rapidly away towards the Casino without looking back. Katherine sat perfectly still, looking after him. Derek Kettering--Richard Knighton--two men so different--so very different. There was something kind about Knighton, kind and trustworthy. As to Derek-- Then suddenly Katherine had a very curious sensation. She felt that she was no longer sitting alone on the seat in the Casino gardens, but that some one was standing beside her, and that that some one was the dead woman, Ruth Kettering. She had a further impression that Ruth wanted--badly--to tell her something. The impression was so curious, so vivid, that it could not be driven away. She felt absolutely certain that the spirit of Ruth Kettering was trying to convey something of vital importance to her. The impression faded. Katherine got up, trembling a little. What was it that Ruth Kettering had wanted so badly to say?"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,1,"When Knighton left Katherine he went in search of Hercule Poirot, whom he found in the Rooms, jauntily placing the minimum stake on the even numbers. As Knighton joined him, the number thirty-three turned up, and Poirot's stake was swept away. ""Bad luck!"" said Knighton; ""are you going to stake again?"" Poirot shook his head. ""Not at present."" ""Do you feel the fascination of gambling?"" asked Knighton curiously. ""Not at roulette."" Knighton shot a swift glance at him. His own face became troubled. He spoke haltingly, with a touch of deference. ""I wonder, are you busy, M. Poirot? There is something I would like to ask you about."" ""I am at your disposal. Shall we go outside? It is pleasant in the sunshine."" They strolled out together, and Knighton drew a deep breath. ""I love the Riviera,"" he said. ""I came here first twelve years ago, during the War, when I was sent to Lady Tamplin's Hospital. It was like Paradise, coming from Flanders to this."" ""It must have been,"" said Poirot. ""How long ago the War seems now!"" mused Knighton. They walked on in silence for some little way. ""You have something on your mind?"" said Poirot. Knighton looked at him in some surprise. ""You are quite right,"" he confessed. ""I don't know how you knew it, though."" ""It showed itself only too plainly,"" said Poirot drily. ""I did not know that I was so transparent."" ""It is my business to observe the physiognomy,"" the little man explained, with dignity. ""I will tell you, M. Poirot. You have heard of this dancer woman--Mirelle?"" ""She who is the _chère amie_ of M. Derek Kettering?"" ""Yes, that is the one; and, knowing this, you will understand that Mr. Van Aldin is naturally prejudiced against her. She wrote to him, asking for an interview. He told me to dictate a curt refusal, which of course I did. This morning she came to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,2,"the hotel and sent up her card, saying that it was urgent and vital that she should see Mr. Van Aldin at once."" ""You interest me,"" said Poirot. ""Mr. Van Aldin was furious. He told me what message to send down to her. I ventured to disagree with him. It seemed to me both likely and probable that this woman Mirelle might give us valuable information. We know that she was on the Blue Train, and she may have seen or heard something that it might be vital for us to know. Don't you agree with me, M. Poirot?"" ""I do,"" said Poirot drily. ""M. Van Aldin, if I may say so, behaved exceedingly foolishly."" ""I am glad you take that view of the matter,"" said the secretary. ""Now I am going to tell you something, M. Poirot. So strongly did I feel the unwisdom of Mr. Van Aldin's attitude that I went down privately and had an interview with the lady."" ""_Eh bien?_"" ""The difficulty was that she insisted on seeing Mr. Van Aldin himself. I softened his message as much as I possibly could. In fact--to be candid--I gave it in a very different form. I said that Mr. Van Aldin was too busy to see her at present, but that she might make any communication she wished to me. That, however, she could not bring herself to do, and she left without saying anything further. But I have a strong impression, M. Poirot, that that woman knows something."" ""This is serious,"" said Poirot quietly. ""You know where she is staying?"" ""Yes."" Knighton mentioned the name of the hotel. ""Good,"" said Poirot; ""we will go there immediately."" The secretary looked doubtful. ""And Mr. Van Aldin?"" he queried doubtfully. ""M. Van Aldin is an obstinate man,"" said Poirot drily. ""I do not argue with obstinate men. I act in spite of them. We will go and see the lady"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,3,"immediately. I will tell her that you are empowered by M. Van Aldin to act for him, and you will guard yourself well from contradicting me."" Knighton still looked slightly doubtful, but Poirot took no notice of his hesitation. At the hotel, they were told that Mademoiselle was in, and Poirot sent up both his and Knighton's cards, with ""From Mr. Van Aldin"" pencilled upon them. Word came down that Mademoiselle Mirelle would receive them. When they were ushered into the dancer's apartments, Poirot immediately took the lead. ""Mademoiselle,"" he murmured, bowing very low, ""we are here on behalf of M. Van Aldin."" ""Ah! And why did he not come himself?"" ""He is indisposed,"" said Poirot mendaciously; ""the Riviera throat, it has him in its grip, but me, I am empowered to act for him, as is Major Knighton, his secretary. Unless, of course, Mademoiselle would prefer to wait a fortnight or so."" If there was one thing of which Poirot was tolerably certain, it was that to a temperament such as Mirelle's the mere word ""wait"" was anathema. ""_Eh bien_, I will speak, Messieurs,"" she cried. ""I have been patient. I have held my hand. And for what? That I should be insulted! Yes, insulted! Ah! Does he think to treat Mirelle like that? To throw her off like an old glove. I tell you never has a man tired of me. Always it is I who tire of them."" She paced up and down the room, her slender body trembling with rage. A small table impeded her free passage and she flung it from her into a corner, where it splintered against the wall. ""That is what I will do to him,"" she cried, ""and that!"" Picking up a glass bowl filled with lilies she flung it into the grate, where it smashed into a hundred pieces. Knighton was looking at her with cold British disapproval. He felt"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,4,"embarrassed and ill at ease. Poirot, on the other hand, with twinkling eyes was thoroughly enjoying the scene. ""Ah, it is magnificent!"" he cried. ""It can be seen--Madame has a temperament."" ""I am an artist,"" said Mirelle; ""every artist has a temperament. I told Dereek to beware, and he would not listen."" She whirled round on Poirot suddenly. ""It is true, is it not, that he wants to marry that English miss?"" Poirot coughed. ""_On m'a dit_,"" he murmured, ""that he adores her passionately."" Mirelle came towards them. ""He murdered his wife,"" she screamed. ""There--now you have it! He told me beforehand that he meant to do it. He had got to an _impasse_--zut! he took the easiest way out."" ""You say that M. Kettering murdered his wife."" ""Yes, yes, yes. Have I not told you so?"" ""The police,"" murmured Poirot, ""will need proof of that--er--statement."" ""I tell you I saw him come out of her compartment that night on the train."" ""When?"" asked Poirot sharply. ""Just before the train reached Lyons."" ""You will swear to that, Mademoiselle?"" It was a different Poirot who spoke now, sharp and decisive. ""Yes."" There was a moment's silence. Mirelle was panting, and her eyes, half defiant, half frightened, went from the face of one man to the other. ""This is a serious matter, Mademoiselle,"" said the detective. ""You realize how serious?"" ""Certainly I do."" ""That is well,"" said Poirot. ""Then you understand, Mademoiselle, that no time must be lost. You will, perhaps, accompany us immediately to the office of the Examining Magistrate."" Mirelle was taken aback. She hesitated, but, as Poirot had foreseen, she had no loophole for escape. ""Very well,"" she muttered. ""I will fetch a coat."" Left alone together, Poirot and Knighton exchanged glances. ""It is necessary to act while--how do you say it?--the iron is hot,"" murmured Poirot. ""She is temperamental; in an hour's time, maybe, she will repent, and"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,5,"she will wish to draw back. We must prevent that at all costs."" Mirelle reappeared, wrapped in a sand-coloured velvet wrap trimmed with leopard skin. She looked not altogether unlike a leopardess, tawny and dangerous. Her eyes still flashed with anger and determination. They found M. Caux and the Examining Magistrate together. A few brief introductory words from Poirot, and Mademoiselle Mirelle was courteously entreated to tell her tale. This she did in much the same words as she had done to Knighton and Poirot, though with far more soberness of manner. ""This is an extraordinary story, Mademoiselle,"" said M. Carrège slowly. He leant back in his chair, adjusted his pince-nez, and looked keenly and searchingly at the dancer through them. ""You wish us to believe M. Kettering actually boasted of the crime to you beforehand?"" ""Yes, yes. She was too healthy, he said. If she were to die it must be an accident--he would arrange it all."" ""You are aware, Mademoiselle,"" said M. Carrège sternly, ""that you are making yourself out to be an accessory before the fact?"" ""Me? But not the least in the world, Monsieur. Not for a moment did I take that statement seriously. Ah no, indeed! I know men, Monsieur; they say many wild things. It would be an odd state of affairs if one were to take all they said _au pied de la lettre_."" The Examining Magistrate raised his eyebrows. ""We are to take it, then, that you regarded M. Kettering's threats as mere idle words? May I ask, Mademoiselle, what made you throw up your engagements in London and come out to the Riviera?"" Mirelle looked at him with melting black eyes. ""I wished to be with the man I loved,"" she said simply. ""Was it so unnatural?"" Poirot interpolated a question gently. ""Was it, then, at M. Kettering's wish that you accompanied him to Nice?"" Mirelle seemed to find a little"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,6,"difficulty in answering this. She hesitated perceptibly before she spoke. When she did, it was with a haughty indifference of manner. ""In such matters I please myself, Monsieur,"" she said. That the answer was not an answer at all was noted by all three men. They said nothing. ""When were you first convinced that M. Kettering had murdered his wife?"" ""As I tell you, Monsieur, I saw M. Kettering come out of his wife's compartment just before the train drew into Lyons. There was a look on his face--ah! at the moment I could not understand it--a look haunted and terrible. I shall never forget it."" Her voice rose shrilly, and she flung out her arms in an extravagant gesture. ""Quite so,"" said M. Carrège. ""Afterwards, when I found that Madame Kettering was dead when the train left Lyons, then--then I knew!"" ""And still--you did not go to the police, Mademoiselle,"" said the Commissary mildly. Mirelle glanced at him superbly; she was clearly enjoying herself in the rôle she was playing. ""Shall I betray my lover?"" she asked. ""Ah no; do not ask a woman to do that."" ""Yet now--"" hinted M. Caux. ""Now it is different. He has betrayed me! Shall I suffer that in silence...?"" The Examining Magistrate checked her. ""Quite so, quite so,"" he murmured soothingly. ""And now, Mademoiselle, perhaps you will read over the statement of what you have told us, see that it is correct, and sign it."" Mirelle wasted no time on the document. ""Yes, yes,"" she said, ""it is correct."" She rose to her feet. ""You require me no longer, Messieurs?"" ""At present, no, Mademoiselle."" ""And Dereek will be arrested?"" ""At once, Mademoiselle."" Mirelle laughed cruelly and drew her fur draperies closer about her. ""He should have thought of this before he insulted me,"" she cried. ""There is one little matter""--Poirot coughed apologetically--""just a matter of detail."" ""Yes?"" ""What makes you think Madame"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,7,"Kettering was dead when the train left Lyons?"" Mirelle stared. ""But she _was_ dead."" ""Was she?"" ""Yes, of course. I--"" She came to an abrupt stop. Poirot was regarding her intently, and he saw the wary look that came into her eyes. ""I have been told so. Everybody says so."" ""Oh,"" said Poirot, ""I was not aware that the fact had been mentioned outside the Examining Magistrate's office."" Mirelle appeared somewhat discomposed. ""One hears those things,"" she said vaguely; ""they get about. Somebody told me. I can't remember who it was."" She moved to the door. M. Caux sprang forward to open it for her, and as he did so, Poirot's voice rose gently once more. ""And the jewels? Pardon, Mademoiselle. Can you tell me anything about those?"" ""The jewels? What jewels?"" ""The rubies of Catherine the Great. Since you hear so much, you must have heard of them."" ""I know nothing about any jewels,"" said Mirelle sharply. She went out, closing the door behind her. M. Caux came back to his chair; the Examining Magistrate sighed. ""What a fury!"" he said, ""but _diablement chic_, I wonder if she is telling the truth? I think so."" ""There is _some_ truth in her story, certainly,"" said Poirot. ""We have confirmation of it from Miss Grey. She was looking down the corridor a short time before the train reached Lyons and she saw M. Kettering go into his wife's compartment."" ""The case against him seems quite clear,"" said the Commissary, sighing; ""it is a thousand pities,"" he murmured. ""How do you mean?"" asked Poirot. ""It has been the ambition of my life to lay the Comte de la Roche by the heels. This time, _ma foi_, I thought we had got him. This other--it is not nearly so satisfactory."" M. Carrège rubbed his nose. ""If anything goes wrong,"" he observed cautiously, ""it will be most awkward. M. Kettering is of the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,8,"aristocracy. It will get into the newspapers. If we have made a mistake--"" He shrugged his shoulders forebodingly. ""The jewels now,"" said the Commissary, ""what do you think he has done with them?"" ""He took them for a plant, of course,"" said M. Carrège; ""they must have been a great inconvenience to him and very awkward to dispose of."" Poirot smiled. ""I have an idea of my own about the jewels. Tell me, Messieurs, what do you know of a man called the Marquis?"" The Commissary leant forward excitedly. ""The Marquis,"" he said, ""the Marquis? Do you think he is mixed up in this affair, M. Poirot?"" ""I ask you what you know of him."" The Commissary made an expressive grimace. ""Not as much as we should like to,"" he observed ruefully. ""He works behind the scenes, you understand. He has underlings who do his dirty work for him. But he is some one high up. That we are sure of. He does not come from the criminal classes."" ""A Frenchman?"" ""Y--es. At least we believe so. But we are not sure. He has worked in France, in England, in America. There was a series of robberies in Switzerland last autumn which were laid at his door. By all accounts he is a _grand seigneur_, speaking French and English with equal perfection and his origin is a mystery."" Poirot nodded and rose to take his departure. ""Can you tell us nothing more, M. Poirot,"" urged the Commissary. ""At present, no,"" said Poirot, ""but I may have news awaiting me at my hotel."" M. Carrège looked uncomfortable. ""If the Marquis is concerned in this--"" he began, and then stopped. ""It upsets our ideas,"" complained M. Caux. ""It does not upset mine,"" said Poirot. ""On the contrary, I think it agrees with them very well. Au revoir, Messieurs; if news of any importance comes to me I will communicate it to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,9,"you immediately."" He walked back to his hotel with a grave face. In his absence a telegram had come to him. Taking a paper-cutter from his pocket, he slit it open. It was a long telegram, and he read it over twice before slowly putting it in his pocket. Upstairs, George was awaiting his master. ""I am fatigued, Georges, much fatigued. Will you order for me a small pot of chocolate?"" The chocolate was duly ordered and brought, and George set it at the little table at his master's elbow. As he was preparing to retire, Poirot spoke: ""I believe, Georges, that you have a good knowledge of the English aristocracy?"" murmured Poirot. George smiled apologetically. ""I think that I might say that I have, sir,"" he replied. ""I suppose that it is your opinion, Georges, that criminals are invariably drawn from the lower orders."" ""Not always, sir. There was great trouble with one of the Duke of Devize's younger sons. He left Eton under a cloud, and after that he caused great anxiety on several occasions. The police would not accept the view that it was kleptomania. A very clever young gentleman, sir, but vicious through and through, if you take my meaning. His Grace shipped him to Australia, and I hear he was convicted out there under another name. Very odd, sir, but there it is. The young gentleman, I need hardly say, was not in want financially."" Poirot nodded his head slowly. ""Love of excitement,"" he murmured, ""and a little kink in the brain somewhere. I wonder now--"" He drew out the telegram from his pocket and read it again. ""Then there was Lady Mary Fox's daughter,"" continued the valet in a mood of reminiscence. ""Swindled tradespeople something shocking, she did. Very worrying to the best families, if I may say so, and there are many other queer cases I could mention."" ""You have a wide"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,27,27. Interview with Mirelle,10,"experience, Georges,"" murmured Poirot. ""I often wonder having lived so exclusively with titled families that you demean yourself by coming as a valet to me. I put it down to love of excitement on your part."" ""Not exactly, sir,"" said George. ""I happened to see in _Society Snippets_ that you had been received at Buckingham Palace. That was just when I was looking for a new situation. His Majesty, so it said, had been most gracious and friendly and thought very highly of your abilities."" ""Ah,"" said Poirot, ""one always likes to know the reason for things."" He remained in thought for a few moments and then said: ""You rang up Mademoiselle Papopolous?"" ""Yes, sir; she and her father will be pleased to dine with you to-night."" ""Ah,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. He drank off his chocolate, set the cup and saucer neatly in the middle of the tray, and spoke gently, more to himself than to the valet. ""The squirrel, my good Georges, collects nuts. He stores them up in the autumn so that they may be of advantage to him later. To make a success of humanity, Georges, we must profit by the lessons of those below us in the animal kingdom. I have always done so. I have been the cat, watching at the mouse hole. I have been the good dog following up the scent, and not taking my nose from the trail. And also, my good Georges, I have been the squirrel. I have stored away the little fact here, the little fact there. I go now to my store and I take out one particular nut, a nut that I stored away--let me see, seventeen years ago. You follow me, Georges?"" ""I should hardly have thought, sir,"" said George, ""that nuts would have kept so long as that, though I know one can do wonders with preserving bottles."" Poirot looked at him and smiled."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,1,"Poirot started to keep his dinner appointment with a margin of three-quarters of an hour to spare. He had an object in this. The car took him, not straight to Monte Carlo, but to Lady Tamplin's house at Cap Martin, where he asked for Miss Grey. The ladies were dressing and Poirot was shown into a small salon to wait, and here, after a lapse of three or four minutes, Lenox Tamplin came to him. ""Katherine is not quite ready yet,"" she said. ""Can I give her a message, or would you rather wait until she comes down?"" Poirot looked at her thoughtfully. He was a minute or two in replying, as though something of great weight hung upon his decision. Apparently the answer to such a simple question mattered. ""No,"" he said at last, ""no, I do not think it is necessary that I should wait to see Mademoiselle Katherine. I think, perhaps, that it is better that I should not. These things are sometimes difficult."" Lenox waited politely, her eyebrows slightly raised. ""I have a piece of news,"" continued Poirot. ""You will, perhaps, tell your friend. M. Kettering was arrested to-night for the murder of his wife."" ""You want me to tell Katherine that?"" asked Lenox. She breathed rather hard, as though she had been running; her face, Poirot thought, looked white and strained--rather noticeably so. ""If you please, Mademoiselle."" ""Why?"" said Lenox. ""Do you think Katherine will be upset? Do you think she cares?"" ""I don't know, Mademoiselle,"" said Poirot. ""See, I admit it frankly. As a rule I know everything, but in this case, I--well, I do not. You, perhaps, know better than I do."" ""Yes,"" said Lenox, ""I know--but I am"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,2,"not going to tell you all the same."" She paused for a minute or two, her dark brows drawn together in a frown. ""You believe he did it?"" she said abruptly. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""The police say so."" ""Ah,"" said Lenox, ""hedging, are you? So there is something to hedge about."" Again she was silent, frowning. Poirot said gently: ""You have known Derek Kettering a long time, have you not?"" ""Off and on ever since I was a kid,"" said Lenox gruffly. Poirot nodded his head several times without speaking. With one of her brusque movements Lenox drew forward a chair and sat down on it, her elbows on the table and her face supported by her hands. Sitting thus, she looked directly across the table at Poirot. ""What have they got to go on?"" she demanded. ""Motive, I suppose. Probably came into money at her death."" ""He came into two million."" ""And if she had not died he would have been ruined?"" ""Yes."" ""But there must have been more than that,"" persisted Lenox. ""He travelled by the same train, I know, but--that would not be enough to go on by itself."" ""A cigarette case with the letter 'K' on it which did not belong to Mrs. Kettering was found in her carriage, and he was seen by two people entering and leaving the compartment just before the train got into Lyons."" ""What two people?"" ""Your friend Miss Grey was one of them. The other was Mademoiselle Mirelle, the dancer."" ""And he, Derek, what has he got to say about it?"" demanded Lenox sharply. ""He denies having entered his wife's compartment at all,"" said Poirot. ""Fool!"" said Lenox crisply, frowning. ""Just before Lyons, you say?"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,3,"Does nobody know when--when she died?"" ""The doctors' evidence necessarily cannot be very definite,"" said Poirot; ""they are inclined to think that death was unlikely to have occurred after leaving Lyons. And we know this much, that a few moments after leaving Lyons Mrs. Kettering was dead."" ""How do you know that?"" Poirot was smiling rather oddly to himself. ""Some one else went into her compartment and found her dead."" ""And they did not rouse the train?"" ""No."" ""Why was that?"" ""Doubtless they had their reasons."" Lenox looked at him sharply. ""Do you know the reason?"" ""I think so--yes."" Lenox sat still turning things over in her mind. Poirot watched her in silence. At last she looked up. A soft colour had come into her cheeks and her eyes were shining. ""You think some one on the train must have killed her, but that need not be so at all. What is to stop any one swinging themselves on to the train when it stopped at Lyons? They could go straight to her compartment, strangle her, and take the rubies and drop off the train again without any one being the wiser. She may have been actually killed while the train was in Lyons station. Then she would have been alive when Derek went in, and dead when the other person found her."" Poirot leant back in his chair. He drew a deep breath. He looked across at the girl and nodded his head three times, then he heaved a sigh. ""Mademoiselle,"" he said, ""what you have said there is very just--very true. I was struggling in darkness, and you have shown me a light. There was a point that puzzled me and you have made"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,4,"it plain."" He got up. ""And Derek?"" said Lenox. ""Who knows?"" said Poirot, with a shrug of his shoulders. ""But I will tell you this, Mademoiselle. I am not satisfied; no, I, Hercule Poirot, am not yet satisfied. It may be that this very night I shall learn something more. At least, I go to try."" ""You are meeting some one?"" ""Yes."" ""Some one who knows something?"" ""Some one who might know something. In these matters one must leave no stone unturned. Au revoir, Mademoiselle."" Lenox accompanied him to the door. ""Have I--helped?"" she asked. Poirot's face softened as he looked up at her standing on the doorstep above him. ""Yes, Mademoiselle, you have helped. If things are very dark, always remember that."" When the car had driven off he relapsed into a frowning absorption, but in his eyes was that faint green light which was always the precursor of the triumph to be. He was a few minutes late at the rendezvous, and found that M. Papopolous and his daughter had arrived before him. His apologies were abject, and he outdid himself in politeness and small attentions. The Greek was looking particularly benign and noble this evening, a sorrowful patriarch of blameless life. Zia was looking handsome and good humoured. The dinner was a pleasant one. Poirot was his best and most sparkling self. He told anecdotes, he made jokes, he paid graceful compliments to Zia Papopolous, and he told many interesting incidents of his career. The menu was a carefully selected one, and the wine was excellent. At the close of dinner M. Papopolous inquired politely: ""And the tip I gave you? You have had your little flutter on the horse?"" ""I am in"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,5,"communication with--er--my bookmaker,"" replied Poirot. The eyes of the two men met. ""A well-known horse, eh?"" ""No,"" said Poirot; ""it is what our friends, the English, call a dark horse."" ""Ah!"" said M. Papopolous thoughtfully. ""Now we must step across to the Casino and have our little flutter at the roulette table,"" cried Poirot gaily. At the Casino the party separated, Poirot devoting himself solely to Zia, whilst Papopolous himself drifted away. Poirot was not fortunate, but Zia had a run of good luck, and had soon won a few thousand francs. ""It would be as well,"" she observed drily to Poirot, ""if I stopped now."" Poirot's eyes twinkled. ""Superb!"" he exclaimed. ""You are the daughter of your father, Mademoiselle Zia. To know when to stop. Ah! that is the art."" He looked round the rooms. ""I cannot see your father anywhere about,"" he remarked carelessly. ""I will fetch your cloak for you, Mademoiselle, and we will go out in the gardens."" He did not, however, go straight to the cloak-room. His sharp eyes had seen but a little while before the departure of M. Papopolous. He was anxious to know what had become of the wily Greek. He ran him to earth unexpectedly in the big entrance hall. He was standing by one of the pillars, talking to a lady who had just arrived. The lady was Mirelle. Poirot sidled unostentatiously round the room. He arrived at the other side of the pillar, and unnoticed by the two who were talking together in an animated fashion--or rather, that is to say, the dancer was talking, Papopolous contributing an occasional monosyllable and a good many expressive gestures. ""I tell you I must have time,"" the dancer"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,6,"was saying. ""If you give me time I will get the money."" ""To wait""--the Greek shrugged his shoulders--""it is awkward."" ""Only a very little while,"" pleaded the other. ""Ah! but you must! A week--ten days--that is all I ask. You can be sure of your affair. The money will be forthcoming."" Papopolous shifted a little and looked round him uneasily--to find Poirot almost at his elbow with a beaming innocent face. ""_Ah! vous voilà_, M. Papopolous. I have been looking for you. It is permitted that I take Mademoiselle Zia for a little turn in the gardens? Good evening, Mademoiselle."" He bowed very low to Mirelle. ""A thousand pardons that I did not see you immediately."" The dancer accepted his greetings rather impatiently. She was clearly annoyed at the interruption of her _tête-à-tête_. Poirot was quick to take the hint. Papopolous had already murmured: ""Certainly--but certainly,"" and Poirot withdrew forthwith. He fetched Zia's cloak, and together they strolled out into the gardens. ""This is where the suicides take place,"" said Zia. Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""So it is said. Men are foolish, are they not, Mademoiselle? To eat, to drink, to breathe the good air, it is a very pleasant thing, Mademoiselle. One is foolish to leave all that simply because one has no money--or because the heart aches. _L'amour_, it causes many fatalities, does it not?"" Zia laughed. ""You should not laugh at love, Mademoiselle,"" said Poirot, shaking an energetic forefinger at her. ""You who are young and beautiful."" ""Hardly that,"" said Zia; ""you forget that I am thirty-three, M. Poirot. I am frank with you, because it is no good being otherwise. As you told my father, it is exactly seventeen years since you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,7,"aided us in Paris that time."" ""When I look at you, it seems much less,"" said Poirot gallantly. ""You were then very much as you are now, Mademoiselle, a little thinner, a little paler, a little more serious. Sixteen years old and fresh from your pension. Not quite the _petite pensionnaire_, not quite a woman. You were very delicious, very charming, Mademoiselle Zia; others thought so too, without doubt."" ""At sixteen,"" said Zia, ""one is simple and a little fool."" ""That may be,"" said Poirot, ""yes, that well may be. At sixteen one is credulous, is one not? One believes what one is told."" If he saw the quick sideways glance that the girl shot at him, he pretended not to have done so. He continued dreamily: ""It was a curious affair that, altogether. Your father, Mademoiselle, has never understood the true inwardness of it."" ""No?"" ""When he asked me for details, for explanations, I said to him thus: 'Without scandal, I have got back for you that which was lost. You must ask no questions.' Do you know, Mademoiselle, why I said these things?"" ""I have no idea,"" said the girl coldly. ""It was because I had a soft spot in my heart for a little pensionnaire, so pale, so thin, so serious."" ""I don't understand what you are talking about,"" cried Zia angrily. ""Do you not, Mademoiselle? Have you forgotten Antonio Pirezzio?"" He heard the quick intake of her breath--almost a gasp. ""He came to work as an assistant in the shop, but not thus could he have got hold of what he wanted. An assistant can lift his eyes to his master's daughter, can he not? If he is young and handsome"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,8,"with a glib tongue. And since they cannot make love all the time, they must occasionally talk of things that interest them both--such as that very interesting thing which was temporarily in M. Papopolous' possession. And since, as you say, Mademoiselle, the young are foolish and credulous, it was easy to believe him and to give him a sight of that particular thing, to show him where it was kept. And afterwards when it is gone--when the unbelievable catastrophe has happened. Alas! the poor little pensionnaire. What a terrible position she is in. She is frightened, the poor little one. To speak or not to speak? And then there comes along that excellent fellow, Hercule Poirot. Almost a miracle it must have been, the way things arranged themselves. The priceless heirlooms are restored and there are no awkward questions."" Zia turned on him fiercely. ""You have known all the time? Who told you? Was it--was it Antonio?"" Poirot shook his head. ""No one told me,"" he said quietly. ""I guessed. It was a good guess, was it not, Mademoiselle? You see, unless you are good at guessing, it is not much use being a detective."" The girl walked along beside him for some minutes in silence. Then she said in a hard voice: ""Well, what are you going to do about it, are you going to tell my father?"" ""No,"" said Poirot sharply. ""Certainly not."" She looked at him curiously. ""You want something from me?"" ""I want your help, Mademoiselle."" ""What makes you think that I can help you?"" ""I do not think so. I only hope so."" ""And if I do not help you, then--you will tell my father?"" ""But no, but no! Debarrass"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,9,"yourself of that idea, Mademoiselle. I am not a blackmailer. I do not hold your secret over your head and threaten you with it."" ""If I refuse to help you--"" began the girl slowly. ""Then you refuse, and that is that."" ""Then why--"" she stopped. ""Listen, and I will tell you why. Women, Mademoiselle, are generous. If they can render a service to one who has rendered a service to them, they will do it. I was generous once to you, Mademoiselle. When I might have spoken, I held my tongue."" There was another silence; then the girl said, ""My father gave you a hint the other day."" ""It was very kind of him."" ""I do not think,"" said Zia slowly, ""that there is anything that I can add to that."" If Poirot was disappointed he did not show it. Not a muscle of his face changed. ""_Eh bien!_"" he said cheerfully, ""then we must talk of other things."" And he proceeded to chat gaily. The girl was _distraite_, however, and her answers were mechanical and not always to the point. It was when they were approaching the Casino once more that she seemed to come to a decision. ""M. Poirot?"" ""Yes, Mademoiselle?"" ""I--I should like to help you if I could."" ""You are very amiable, Mademoiselle--very amiable."" Again there was a pause. Poirot did not press her. He was quite content to wait and let her take her own time. ""Ah bah,"" said Zia, ""after all, why should I not tell you? My father is cautious--always cautious in everything he says. But I know that with you it is not necessary. You have told us it is only the murderer you seek, and that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,28,28. Poirot Plays the Squirrel,10,"you are not concerned over the jewels. I believe you. You were quite right when you guessed that we were in Nice because of the rubies. They have been handed over here according to plan. My father has them now. He gave you a hint the other day as to who our mysterious client was."" ""The Marquis?"" murmured Poirot softly. ""Yes, the Marquis."" ""Have you ever seen the Marquis, Mademoiselle Zia?"" ""Once,"" said the girl. ""But not very well,"" she added. ""It was through a keyhole."" ""That always presents difficulties,"" said Poirot sympathetically, ""but all the same you saw him. You would know him again?"" Zia shook her head. ""He wore a mask,"" she explained. ""Young or old?"" ""He had white hair. It may have been a wig, it may not. It fitted very well. But I do not think he was old. His walk was young, and so was his voice."" ""His voice?"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""Ah, his voice! Would you know it again, Mademoiselle Zia?"" ""I might,"" said the girl. ""You were interested in him, eh? It was that that took you to the keyhole."" Zia nodded. ""Yes, yes. I was curious. One had heard so much--he is not the ordinary thief--he is more like a figure of history or romance."" ""Yes,"" said Poirot thoughtfully, ""yes; perhaps so."" ""But it is not this that I meant to tell you,"" said Zia. ""It was just one other little fact that I thought might be--well--useful to you."" ""Yes?"" said Poirot encouragingly. ""The rubies, as I say, were handed over to my father here at Nice. I did not see the person who handed them over, but--"" ""Yes?"" ""I know one thing. _It was a woman._"""

A Letter From Home,1,"""_Dear Katherine--Living among grand friends as you are doing now, I don't suppose you will care to hear any of our news; but as I always thought you were a sensible girl, perhaps you are a trifle less swollen-headed than I suppose. Everything goes on much the same here. There was great trouble about the new curate, who is scandalously high. In my view, he is neither more nor less than a Roman. Everybody has spoken to the Vicar about it, but you know what the Vicar is--all Christian charity and no proper spirit. I have had a lot of trouble with maids lately. That girl Annie was no good--skirts up to her knees and wouldn't wear sensible woollen stockings. Not one of them can bear being spoken to. I have had a lot of pain with my rheumatism one way and another, and Dr. Harris persuaded me to go and see a London specialist--a waste of three guineas and a railway fare, as I told him; but by waiting until Wednesday I managed to get a cheap return. The London doctor pulled a long face and talked all round about and never straight out, until I said to him, 'I'm a plain woman, Doctor, and I like things to be plainly stated. Is it cancer, or is it not?' And then, of course, he had to say it was. They say a year with care, and not too much pain, though I am sure I can bear pain as well as any other Christian woman. Life seems rather lonely at times, with most of my friends dead or gone before. I wish you were in St."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,2,"Mary Mead, my dear, and that is a fact. If you hadn't come into this money and gone off into grand society, I would have offered you double the salary poor Jane gave you to come and look after me; but there--there's no good wanting what we can't get. However, if things should go ill with you--and that is always possible. I have heard no end of tales of bogus noblemen marrying girls and getting hold of their money and then leaving them at the church door. I dare say you are too sensible for anything of the kind to happen to you, but one never knows; and never having had much attention of any kind it might easily go to your head now. So just in case, my dear, remember there is always a home for you here; and though a plain-spoken woman I am a warm-hearted one too.--Your affectionate old friend,_ ""_Amelia Viner._ ""_P.S.--I saw a mention of you in the paper with your cousin, Viscountess Tamplin, and I cut it out and put it with my cuttings. I prayed for you on Sunday that you might be kept from pride and vainglory._"" Katherine read this characteristic epistle through twice, then she laid it down and stared out of her bedroom window across the blue waters of the Mediterranean. She felt a curious lump in her throat. A sudden wave of longing for St. Mary Mead swept over her. So full of familiar, everyday, stupid little things--and yet--home. She felt very inclined to lay her head down on her arms and indulge in a real good cry. Lenox, coming in at the moment, saved her."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,3,"""Hello, Katherine,"" said Lenox. ""I say--what is the matter?"" ""Nothing,"" said Katherine, grabbing up Miss Viner's letter and thrusting it into her handbag. ""You looked rather queer,"" said Lenox. ""I say--I hope you don't mind--I rang up your detective friend, M. Poirot, and asked him to lunch with us in Nice. I said you wanted to see him, as I thought he might not come for me."" ""Did you want to see him then?"" asked Katherine. ""Yes,"" said Lenox. ""I have rather lost my heart to him. I never met a man before whose eyes were really green like a cat's."" ""All right,"" said Katherine. She spoke listlessly. The last few days had been trying. Derek Kettering's arrest had been the topic of the hour, and the Blue Train Mystery had been thrashed out from every conceivable standpoint. ""I have ordered the car,"" said Lenox, ""and I have told Mother some lie or other--unfortunately I can't remember exactly what; but it won't matter, as she never remembers. If she knew where we were going, she would want to come too, to pump M. Poirot."" The two girls arrived at the Negresco to find Poirot waiting. He was full of Gallic politeness, and showered so many compliments upon the two girls that they were soon helpless with laughter; yet for all that the meal was not a gay one. Katherine was dreamy and distracted, and Lenox made bursts of conversation, interspersed by silences. As they were sitting on the terrace sipping their coffee she suddenly attacked Poirot bluntly. ""How are things going? You know what I mean?"" Poirot shrugged his shoulders. ""They take their course,"" he said. ""And"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,4,"you are just letting them take their course?"" He looked at Lenox a little sadly. ""You are young, Mademoiselle, but there are three things that cannot be hurried--_le bon Dieu_, Nature, and old people."" ""Nonsense!"" said Lenox. ""You are not old."" ""Ah, it is pretty what you say there."" ""Here is Major Knighton,"" said Lenox. Katherine looked round quickly and then turned back again. ""He is with Mr. Van Aldin,"" continued Lenox. ""There is something I want to ask Major Knighton about. I won't be a minute."" Left alone together, Poirot bent forward and murmured to Katherine: ""You are _distraite_, Mademoiselle; your thoughts, they are far away, are they not?"" ""Just as far as England, no farther."" Guided by a sudden impulse, she took the letter she had received that morning and handed it across to him to read. ""That is the first word that has come to me from my old life; somehow or other--it hurts."" He read it through and then handed it back to her. ""So you are going back to St. Mary Mead?"" he said slowly. ""No, I am not,"" said Katherine; ""why should I?"" ""Ah,"" said Poirot, ""it is my mistake. You will excuse me one little minute."" He strolled across to where Lenox Tamplin was talking to Van Aldin and Knighton. The American looked old and haggard. He greeted Poirot with a curt nod but without any other sign of animation. As he turned to reply to some observation made by Lenox, Poirot drew Knighton aside. ""M. Van Aldin looks ill,"" he said. ""Do you wonder?"" asked Knighton. ""The scandal of Derek Kettering's arrest has about put the lid on things,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,5,"as far as he is concerned. He is even regretting that he asked you to find out the truth."" ""He should go back to England,"" said Poirot. ""We are going the day after to-morrow."" ""That is good news,"" said Poirot. He hesitated, and looked across the terrace to where Katherine was sitting. ""I wish,"" he murmured, ""that you could tell Miss Grey that."" ""Tell her what?"" ""That you--I mean that M. Van Aldin is returning to England."" Knighton looked a little puzzled, but he readily crossed the terrace and joined Katherine. Poirot saw him go with a satisfied nod of the head, and then joined Lenox and the American. After a minute or two they joined the others. Conversation was general for a few minutes, then the millionaire and his secretary departed. Poirot also prepared to take his departure. ""A thousand thanks for your hospitality, Mesdemoiselles,"" he cried; ""it has been a most charming luncheon. _Ma foi_, I needed it!"" He swelled out his chest and thumped it. ""I am now a lion--a giant. Ah, Mademoiselle Katherine, you have not seen me as I can be. You have seen the gentle, the calm Hercule Poirot; but there is another Hercule Poirot. I go now to bully, to threaten, to strike terror into the hearts of those who listen to me."" He looked at them in a self-satisfied way, and they both appeared to be duly impressed, though Lenox was biting her under lip, and the corners of Katherine's mouth had a suspicious twitch. ""And I shall do it,"" he said gravely. ""Oh yes, I shall succeed."" He had gone but a few steps when Katherine's voice made"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,6,"him turn. ""M. Poirot, I--I want to tell you. I think you were right in what you said. I am going back to England almost immediately."" Poirot stared at her very hard, and under the directness of his scrutiny she blushed. ""I see,"" he said gravely. ""I don't believe you do,"" said Katherine. ""I know more than you think, Mademoiselle,"" he said quietly. He left her, with an odd little smile upon his lips. Entering a waiting car, he drove to Antibes. Hippolyte, the Comte de la Roche's wooden-faced man-servant, was busy at the Villa Marina polishing his master's beautiful cut table glass. The Comte de la Roche himself had gone to Monte Carlo for the day. Chancing to look out of the window, Hippolyte espied a visitor walking briskly up to the hall door, a visitor of so uncommon a type that Hippolyte, experienced as he was, had some difficulty in placing him. Calling to his wife, Marie, who was busy in the kitchen, he drew her attention to what he called _ce type là_. ""It is not the police again?"" said Marie anxiously. ""Look for yourself,"" said Hippolyte. Marie looked. ""Certainly not the police,"" she declared. ""I am glad."" ""They have not really worried us much,"" said Hippolyte. ""In fact, but for Monsieur le Comte's warning, I should never have guessed that stranger at the wine-shop to be what he was."" The hall bell pealed and Hippolyte, in a grave and decorous manner, went to open the door. ""M. le Comte, I regret to say, is not at home."" The little man with the large moustaches beamed placidly. ""I know that,"" he replied. ""You are"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,7,"Hippolyte Flavelle, are you not?"" ""Yes, Monsieur, that is my name."" ""And you have a wife, Marie Flavelle?"" ""Yes, Monsieur, but--"" ""I desire to see you both,"" said the stranger, and he stepped nimbly past Hippolyte into the hall. ""Your wife is doubtless in the kitchen,"" he said. ""I will go there."" Before Hippolyte could recover his breath, the other had selected the right door at the back of the hall and passed along the passage and into the kitchen, where Marie paused open-mouthed to stare at him. ""_Voilà_,"" said the stranger, and sank into a wooden arm-chair; ""I am Hercule Poirot."" ""Yes, Monsieur?"" ""You do not know the name?"" ""I have never heard it,"" said Hippolyte. ""Permit me to say that you have been badly educated. It is the name of one of the great ones of this world."" He sighed and folded his hands across his chest. Hippolyte and Marie were staring at him uneasily. They were at a loss what to make of this unexpected and extremely strange visitor. ""Monsieur desires--"" murmured Hippolyte mechanically. ""I desire to know why you have lied to the police."" ""Monsieur!"" cried Hippolyte; ""I--lied to the police? Never have I done such a thing."" M. Poirot shook his head. ""You are wrong,"" he said; ""you have done it on several occasions. Let me see."" He took a small notebook from his pocket and consulted it. ""Ah, yes; on seven occasions at least. I will recite them to you."" In a gentle unemotional voice he proceeded to outline the seven occasions. Hippolyte was taken aback. ""But it is not of these past lapses that I wish to speak,"" continued"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,8,"Poirot, ""only, my dear friend, do not get into the habit of thinking yourself too clever. I come now to the particular lie in which I am concerned--your statement that the Comte de la Roche arrived at this villa on the morning of 14th January."" ""But that was no lie, Monsieur; that was the truth. Monsieur le Comte arrived here on the morning of Tuesday, the 14th. That is so, Marie, is it not?"" Marie assented eagerly. ""Ah, yes, that is quite right. I remember it perfectly."" ""Ah,"" said Poirot, ""and what did you give your good master for _déjeuner_ that day?"" ""I--"" Marie paused, trying to collect herself. ""Odd,"" said Poirot, ""how one remembers some things--and forgets others."" He leant forward and struck the table a blow with his fist; his eyes flashed with anger. ""Yes, yes, it is as I say. You tell your lies and you think nobody knows. But there are two people who know. Yes--two people. One is _le bon Dieu_--"" He raised a hand to heaven, and then settling himself back in his chair and shutting his eyelids, he murmured comfortably: ""And the other is Hercule Poirot."" ""I assure you, Monsieur, you are completely mistaken. Monsieur le Comte left Paris on Monday night--"" ""True,"" said Poirot--""by the Rapide. I do not know where he broke his journey. Perhaps you do not know that. What I do know is that he arrived here on Wednesday morning, and not on Tuesday morning."" ""Monsieur is mistaken,"" said Marie stolidly. Poirot rose to his feet. ""Then the law must take its course,"" he murmured. ""A pity."" ""What do you mean, Monsieur?"" asked Marie, with"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,9,"a shade of uneasiness. ""You will be arrested and held as accomplices concerned in the murder of Mrs. Kettering, the English lady who was killed."" ""Murder!"" The man's face had gone chalk white, his knees knocked together. Marie dropped the rolling-pin and began to weep. ""But it is impossible--impossible. I thought--"" ""Since you stick to your story, there is nothing to be said. I think you are both foolish."" He was turning towards the door when an agitated voice arrested him. ""Monsieur, Monsieur, just a little moment. I--I had no idea that it was anything of this kind. I--I thought it was just a matter concerning a lady. There have been little awkwardnesses with the police over ladies before. But murder--that is very different."" ""I have no patience with you,"" cried Poirot. He turned round on them and angrily shook his fist in Hippolyte's face. ""Am I to stop here all day, arguing with a couple of imbeciles thus? It is the truth I want. If you will not give it to me, that is your look out. _For the last time, when did Monsieur le Comte arrive at the Villa Marina--Tuesday morning or Wednesday morning?_"" ""Wednesday,"" gasped the man, and behind him Marie nodded confirmation. Poirot regarded them for a minute or two, then inclined his head gravely. ""You are wise, my children,"" he said quietly. ""Very nearly you were in serious trouble."" He left the Villa Marina, smiling to himself. ""One guess, confirmed,"" he murmured to himself. ""Shall I take a chance on the other?"" It was six o'clock when the card of Monsieur Hercule Poirot was brought up to Mirelle. She stared at"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,29,29. A Letter From Home,10,"it for a moment or two, and then nodded. When Poirot entered, he found her walking up and down the room feverishly. She turned on him furiously. ""Well?"" she cried. ""Well? What is it now? Have you not tortured me enough, all of you? Have you not made me betray my poor Dereek? What more do you want?"" ""Just one little question, Mademoiselle. After the train left Lyons, when you entered Mrs. Kettering's compartment--"" ""What is that?"" Poirot looked at her with an air of mild reproach and began again. ""I say when you entered Mrs. Kettering's compartment--"" ""I never did."" ""And found her--"" ""I never did."" ""_Ah, sacré!_"" He turned on her in a rage and shouted at her, so that she cowered back before him. ""Will you lie to me? I tell you I know what happened as well as though I had been there. You went into her compartment and you found her dead. I tell you I know it. To lie to me is dangerous. Be careful, Mademoiselle Mirelle."" Her eyes wavered beneath his gaze and fell. ""I--I didn't--"" she began uncertainly and stopped. ""There is only one thing about which I wonder,"" said Poirot--""I wonder, Mademoiselle, if you found what you were looking for or whether--"" ""Whether what?"" ""Or whether some one else had been before you."" ""I will answer no more questions,"" screamed the dancer. She tore herself away from Poirot's restraining hand, and flinging herself down on the floor in a frenzy, she screamed and sobbed. A frightened maid came rushing in. Hercule Poirot shrugged his shoulders, raised his eyebrows, and quietly left the room. But he seemed satisfied."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,1,"Katherine looked out of Miss Viner's bedroom window. It was raining, not violently, but with a quiet, well-bred persistence. The window looked out on a strip of front garden with a path down to the gate and neat little flower-beds on either side, where later roses and pinks and blue hyacinths would bloom. Miss Viner was lying in a large Victorian bedstead. A tray with the remains of breakfast had been pushed to one side and she was busy opening her correspondence and making various caustic comments upon it. Katherine had an open letter in her hand and was reading it through for the second time. It was dated from the Ritz Hotel, Paris. ""_Chère Mademoiselle Katherine"" (it began)--""I trust that you are in good health and that the return to the English winter has not proved too depressing. Me, I prosecute my inquiries with the utmost diligence. Do not think that it is the holiday that I take here. Very shortly I shall be in England, and I hope then to have the pleasure of meeting you once more. It shall be so, shall it not? On arrival in London I shall write to you. You remember that we are the colleagues in this affair? But indeed I think you know that very well._ ""_Be assured, Mademoiselle, of my most respectful and devoted sentiments._ ""_Hercule Poirot._"" Katherine frowned slightly. It was as though something in the letter puzzled and"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,2,"intrigued her. ""A choir boys' picnic indeed,"" came from Miss Viner. ""Tommy Saunders and Albert Dykes ought to be left behind, and I shan't subscribe to it unless they are. What those two boys think they are doing in church on Sundays I don't know. Tommy sang, 'O God, make speed to save us,' and never opened his lips again, and if Albert Dykes wasn't sucking a mint humbug, my nose is not what it is and always has been."" ""I know, they are awful,"" agreed Katherine. She opened her second letter, and a sudden flush came to her cheeks. Miss Viner's voice in the room seemed to recede into the far distance. When she came back to a sense of her surroundings Miss Viner was bringing a long speech to a triumphant termination. ""And I said to her, 'Not at all. As it happens, Miss Grey is Lady Tamplin's own cousin.' What do you think of that?"" ""Were you fighting my battles for me? That was very sweet of you."" ""You can put it that way if you like. There is nothing to me in a title. Vicar's wife or no vicar's wife, that woman is a cat. Hinting you had bought your way into Society."" ""Perhaps she was not so very far wrong."" ""And look at you,"" continued Miss Viner. ""Have you come back a stuck-up fine lady, as well you might have done? No, there you are,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,3,"as sensible as ever you were, with a pair of good Balbriggan stockings on and sensible shoes. I spoke to Ellen about it only yesterday. 'Ellen,' I said, 'you look at Miss Grey. She has been hobnobbing with some of the greatest in the land, and does she go about as you do with skirts up to her knees and silk stockings that ladder when you look at them, and the most ridiculous shoes that ever I set eyes on?'"" Katherine smiled a little to herself; it had apparently been worth while to conform to Miss Viner's prejudices. The old lady went on with increasing gusto. ""It has been a great relief to me that you have not had your head turned. Only the other day I was looking for my cuttings. I have several about Lady Tamplin and her War Hospital and what not, but I cannot lay my hand upon them. I wish you would look, my dear; your eyesight is better than mine. They are all in a box in the bureau drawer."" Katherine glanced down at the letter in her hand and was about to speak, but checked herself, and going over to the bureau found the box of cuttings and began to look over them. Since her return to St. Mary Mead her heart had gone out to Miss Viner in admiration of the old woman's stoicism and pluck. She felt that there was"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,4,"little she could do for her old friend, but she knew from experience how much those seemingly small trifles meant to old people. ""Here is one,"" she said presently. ""'Viscountess Tamplin, who is running her villa at Nice as an Officers' Hospital, has just been the victim of a sensational robbery, her jewels having been stolen. Amongst them were some very famous emeralds, heirlooms of the Tamplin family.'"" ""Probably paste,"" said Miss Viner; ""a lot of these Society women's jewels are."" ""Here is another,"" said Katherine. ""A picture of her, 'A charming camera study of Viscountess Tamplin with her little daughter Lenox.'"" ""Let me look,"" said Miss Viner. ""You can't see much of the child's face, can you? But I dare say that is just as well. Things go by contraries in this world and beautiful mothers have hideous children. I dare say the photographer realized that to take the back of the child's head was the best thing he could do for her."" Katherine laughed. ""'One of the smartest hostesses on the Riviera this season is Viscountess Tamplin, who has a villa at Cap Martin. Her cousin, Miss Grey, who recently inherited a vast fortune in a most romantic manner, is staying with her there.'"" ""That is the one I wanted,"" said Miss Viner. ""I expect there has been a picture of you in one of the papers that I have missed; you know the kind of thing."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,5,"Mrs. Somebody or other Jones-Williams, at the something or other Point-to-point, usually carrying a shooting-stick and having one foot lifted up in the air. It must be a trial to some of them to see what they look like."" Katherine did not answer. She was smoothing out the cutting with her finger, and her face had a puzzled, worried look. Then she drew the second letter out of its envelope and mastered its contents once more. She turned to her friend. ""Miss Viner? I wonder--there is a friend of mine, some one I met on the Riviera, who wants very much to come down and see me here?"" ""A man,"" said Miss Viner. ""Yes."" ""Who is he?"" ""He is secretary to Mr. Van Aldin, the American millionaire."" ""What is his name?"" ""Knighton. Major Knighton."" ""Hm--secretary to a millionaire. And wants to come down here. Now, Katherine, I am going to say something to you for your own good. You are a nice girl and a sensible girl, and though you have your head screwed on the right way about most things, every woman makes a fool of herself once in her life. Ten to one what this man is after is your money."" With a gesture she arrested Katherine's reply. ""I have been waiting for something of this kind. What is a secretary to a millionaire? Nine times out of ten it is a young man who likes living"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,6,"soft. A young man with nice manners and a taste for luxury and no brains and no enterprise, and if there is anything that is a softer job than being a secretary to a millionaire it is marrying a rich woman for her money. I am not saying that you might not be some man's fancy. But you are not young, and though you have a very good complexion you are not a beauty, and what I say to you is, don't make a fool of yourself; but if you are determined to do so, do see that your money is properly tied up on yourself. There, now I have finished. What have you got to say?"" ""Nothing,"" said Katherine; ""but would you mind if he did come to see me?"" ""I wash my hands of it,"" said Miss Viner. ""I have done my duty, and whatever happens now is on your own head. Would you like him to lunch or to dinner? I dare say Ellen could manage dinner--that is, if she didn't lose her head."" ""Lunch would be very nice,"" said Katherine. ""It is awfully kind of you, Miss Viner. He asked me to ring him up, so I will do so and say that we shall be pleased if he will lunch with us. He will motor down from town."" ""Ellen does a steak with grilled tomatoes pretty fairly,"" said Miss Viner. ""She doesn't do it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,7,"well, but she does it better than anything else. It is no good having a tart because she is heavy handed with pastry; but her little castle puddings are not bad, and I dare say you could find a nice piece of Stilton at Abbot's. I have always heard that gentlemen like a nice piece of Stilton, and there is a good deal of father's wine left, a bottle of sparkling Moselle, perhaps."" ""Oh, no, Miss Viner; that is really not necessary."" ""Nonsense, my child. No gentleman is happy unless he drinks something with his meal. There is some good prewar whisky if you think he would prefer that. Now do as I say and don't argue. The key of the wine-cellar is in the third drawer down in the dressing-table, in the second pair of stockings on the left-hand side."" Katherine went obediently to the spot indicated. ""The second pair, now mind,"" said Miss Viner. ""The first pair has my diamond earrings and my filigree brooch in it."" ""Oh,"" said Katherine, rather taken aback, ""wouldn't you like them put in your jewel-case?"" Miss Viner gave vent to a terrific and prolonged snort. ""No, indeed! I have much too much sense for that sort of thing, thank you. Dear, dear, I well remember how my poor father had a safe built in downstairs. Pleased as Punch he was with it, and he said to my mother, 'Now, Mary, you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,8,"bring me your jewels in their case every night and I will lock them away for you.' My mother was a very tactful woman, and she knew that gentlemen like having their own way, and she brought him the jewel-case locked up just as he said. ""And one night burglars broke in, and of course--naturally--the first thing they went for was the safe! It would be, with my father talking up and down the village and bragging about it until you might have thought he kept all King Solomon's diamonds there. They made a clean sweep, got the tankards, the silver cups, and the presentation gold plate that my father had had presented to him, _and_ the jewel-case."" She sighed reminiscently. ""My father was in a great state over my mother's jewels. There was the Venetian set and some very fine cameos and some pale pink corals, and two diamond rings with quite large stones in them. And then, of course, she had to tell him that, being a sensible woman, she had kept her jewellery rolled up in a pair of corsets, and there it was still as safe as anything."" ""And the jewel-case had been quite empty?"" ""Oh no, dear,"" said Miss Viner, ""it would have been too light a weight then. My mother was a very intelligent woman; she saw to that. She kept her buttons in the jewel-case, and a very handy place it was."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,9,"Boot buttons in the top tray, trouser buttons in the second tray, and assorted buttons below. Curiously enough, my father was quite annoyed with her. He said he didn't like deceit. But I mustn't go chattering on; you want to go and ring up your friend, and mind you choose a nice piece of steak, and tell Ellen she is not to have holes in her stockings when she waits at lunch."" ""Is her name Ellen or Helen, Miss Viner? I thought--"" Miss Viner closed her eyes. ""I can sound my h's, dear, as well as any one, but Helen is _not_ a suitable name for a servant. I don't know what the mothers in the lower classes are coming to nowadays."" The rain had cleared away when Knighton arrived at the cottage. The pale fitful sunshine shone down on it and burnished Katherine's head as she stood in the doorway to welcome him. He came up to her quickly, almost boyishly. ""I say, I hope you don't mind. I simply had to see you again soon. I hope the friend you are staying with does not mind."" ""Come in and make friends with her,"" said Katherine. ""She can be most alarming, but you will soon find that she has the softest heart in the world."" Miss Viner was enthroned majestically in the drawing-room, wearing a complete set of the cameos which had been so providentially preserved in the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,30,30. Miss Viner Gives Judgment,10,"family. She greeted Knighton with dignity and an austere politeness which would have damped many men. Knighton, however, had a charm of manner which was not easily set aside, and after about ten minutes Miss Viner thawed perceptibly. Luncheon was a merry meal, and Ellen, or Helen, in a new pair of silk stockings devoid of ladders performed prodigies of waiting. Afterwards, Katherine and Knighton went for a walk and they came back to have tea _tête-à-tête_, since Miss Viner had gone to lie down. When the car had finally driven off Katherine went slowly upstairs. A voice called her and she went in to Miss Viner's bedroom. ""Friend gone?"" ""Yes. Thank you so much for letting me ask him down."" ""No need to thank me. Do you think I am the sort of old curmudgeon who never will do anything for anybody?"" ""I think you are a dear,"" said Katherine affectionately. ""Humph,"" said Miss Viner mollified. As Katherine was leaving the room she called her back. ""Katherine?"" ""Yes."" ""I was wrong about that young man of yours. A man when he is making up to anybody can be cordial and gallant and full of little attentions and altogether charming. But when a man is really in love he can't help looking like a sheep. Now, whenever that young man looked at you he looked like a sheep. I take back all I said this morning. It is genuine."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,1,"""Ah!"" said Mr. Joseph Aarons, appreciatively. He took a long draught from his tankard, set it down with a sigh, wiped the froth from his lips, and beamed across the table at his host, Monsieur Hercule Poirot. ""Give me,"" said Mr. Aarons, ""a good Porterhouse steak and a tankard of something worth drinking, and any one can have your French fallals and whatnots, your ordoovres and your omelettes and your little bits of quail. Give me,"" he reiterated, ""a Porterhouse steak."" Poirot, who had just complied with this request, smiled sympathetically. ""Not that there is much wrong with a steak and kidney pudding,"" continued Mr. Aarons. ""Apple tart?"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,2,"Yes, I will take apple tart, thank you, Miss, and a jug of cream."" The meal proceeded. Finally, with a long sigh, Mr. Aarons laid down his spoon and fork preparatory to toying with some cheese before turning his mind to other matters. ""There was a little matter of business I think you said, Monsieur Poirot,"" he remarked. ""Anything I can do to help you I am sure I shall be most happy."" ""That is very kind of you,"" said Poirot. ""I said to myself, 'If you want to know anything about the dramatic profession there is one person who knows all that is to be known and"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,3,"that is my old friend, Mr. Joseph Aarons.'"" ""And you don't say far wrong,"" said Mr. Aarons complacently; ""whether it is past, present, or future, Joe Aarons is the man to come to."" ""_Précisément._ Now I want to ask you, Monsieur Aarons, what you know about a young woman called Kidd."" ""Kidd? Kitty Kidd?"" ""Kitty Kidd."" ""Pretty smart, she was. Male impersonator, song and a dance--That one?"" ""That is the one."" ""_Very_ smart, she was. Made a good income. Never out of an engagement. Male impersonation mostly, but, as a matter of fact, you could not touch her as a character actress."" ""So I have heard,"" said Poirot;"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,4,"""but she has not been appearing lately, has she?"" ""No. Dropped right out of things. Went over to France and took up with some swell nobleman there. She quitted the stage then for good and all, I guess."" ""How long ago was that?"" ""Let me see. Three years ago. And she has been a loss--let me tell you that."" ""She was clever?"" ""Clever as a cartload of monkeys."" ""You don't know the name of the man she became friends with in Paris?"" ""He was a swell, I know that. A Count--or was it a Marquis? Now I come to think of it, I believe it was a Marquis."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,5,"""And you know nothing about her since?"" ""Nothing. Never even run across her accidentally like. I bet she is tooling it round some of these foreign resorts. Being a Marquise to the life. You couldn't put one over on Kitty. She would give as good as she got any day."" ""I see,"" said Poirot thoughtfully. ""I am sorry I can't tell you more, Monsieur Poirot,"" said the other. ""I would like to be of use to you if I could. You did me a good turn once."" ""Ah, but we are quits on that; you, too, did me a good turn."" ""One good turn deserves another. Ha, ha!"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,6,"said Mr. Aarons. ""Your profession must be a very interesting one,"" said Poirot. ""So-so,"" said Mr. Aarons non-committally. ""Taking the rough with the smooth, it is all right. I don't do so badly at it, all things considered, but you have to keep your eyes skinned. Never know what the public will jump for next."" ""Dancing has come very much to the fore in the last few years,"" murmured Poirot reflectively. ""_I_ never saw anything in this Russian ballet, but people like it. Too highbrow for me."" ""I met one dancer out on the Riviera--Mademoiselle Mirelle."" ""Mirelle? She is hot stuff, by all accounts. There is always money"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,7,"going to back her--though, so far as that goes, the girl can dance; I have seen her, and I know what I am talking about. I never had much to do with her myself, but I hear she is a terror to deal with. Tempers and tantrums all the time."" ""Yes,"" said Poirot thoughtfully; ""yes, so I should imagine."" ""Temperament!"" said Mr. Aarons, ""temperament! That is what they call it themselves. My missus was a dancer before she married me, but I am thankful to say she never had any temperament. You don't want temperament in the home, Monsieur Poirot."" ""I agree with you, my friend; it"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,8,"is out of place there."" ""A woman should be calm and sympathetic, and a good cook,"" said Mr. Aarons. ""Mirelle has not been long before the public, has she?"" asked Poirot. ""About two and a half years, that is all,"" said Mr. Aarons. ""Some French Duke started her. I hear now that she has taken up with the ex-Prime Minister of Greece. These are the chaps who manage to put money away quietly."" ""That is news to me,"" said Poirot. ""Oh, she's not one to let the grass grow under her feet. They say that young Kettering murdered his wife on her account. I don't know, I"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,9,"am sure. Anyway, he is in prison, and she had to look round for herself, and pretty smart she has been about it. They say she is wearing a ruby the size of a pigeon's egg--not that I have ever seen a pigeon's egg myself, but that is what they always call it in works of fiction."" ""A ruby the size of a pigeon's egg!"" said Poirot. His eyes were green and cat-like. ""How interesting!"" ""I had it from a friend of mine,"" said Mr. Aarons. ""But, for all I know, it may be coloured glass. They are all the same, these women--they never stop telling tall"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,31,31. Mr. Aarons Lunches,10,"stories about their jewels. Mirelle goes about bragging that it has got a curse on it. 'Heart of Fire,' I think she calls it."" ""But if I remember rightly,"" said Poirot, ""the ruby that is named 'Heart of Fire' is the centre stone in a necklace."" ""There you are! Didn't I tell you there is no end to the lies women will tell about their jewellery? This is a single stone, hung on a platinum chain round her neck; but, as I said before, ten to one it is a bit of coloured glass."" ""No,"" said Poirot gently; ""no--somehow I do not think it is coloured glass."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,1,"""You have changed, Mademoiselle,"" said Poirot suddenly. He and Katherine were seated opposite each other at a small table at the Savoy. ""Yes, you have changed,"" he continued. ""In what way?"" ""Mademoiselle, these _nuances_ are difficult to express."" ""I am older."" ""Yes, you are older. And by that I do not mean that the wrinkles and the crows' feet are coming. When I first saw you, Mademoiselle, you were a looker-on at life. You had the quiet, amused look of one who sits back in the stalls and watches the play."" ""And now?"" ""Now, you no longer watch. It is an absurd thing, perhaps, that I say here, but you have the wary look of a fighter who is playing a difficult game."" ""My old lady is difficult sometimes,"" said Katherine, with a smile; ""but I can assure you that I don't engage in deadly contests with"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,2,"her. You must go down and see her some day, Monsieur Poirot. I think you are one of the people who would appreciate her pluck and her spirit."" There was a silence while the waiter deftly served them with chicken _en casserole_. When he had departed, Poirot said: ""You have heard me speak of my friend Hastings?--he who said that I was a human oyster. _Eh bien_, Mademoiselle, I have met my match in you. You, far more than I, play a lone hand."" ""Nonsense,"" said Katherine lightly. ""Never does Hercule Poirot talk nonsense. It is as I say."" Again there was a silence. Poirot broke it by inquiring: ""Have you seen any of our Riviera friends since you have been back, Mademoiselle?"" ""I have seen something of Major Knighton."" ""A-ha! Is that so?"" Something in Poirot's twinkling eyes made Katherine lower hers. ""So Mr. Van Aldin"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,3,"remains in London?"" ""Yes."" ""I must try to see him to-morrow or the next day."" ""You have news for him?"" ""What makes you think that?"" ""I--wondered, that is all."" Poirot looked across at her with twinkling eyes. ""And now, Mademoiselle, there is much that you wish to ask me, I can see that. And why not? Is not the affair of the Blue Train our own 'Roman Policier'?"" ""Yes, there are things I should like to ask you."" ""_Eh bien?_"" Katherine looked up with a sudden air of resolution. ""What were you doing in Paris, Monsieur Poirot?"" Poirot smiled slightly. ""I made a call at the Russian Embassy."" ""Oh."" ""I see that that tells you nothing. But I will not be a human oyster. No, I will lay my cards on the table, which is assuredly a thing that oysters do not do. You suspect, do you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,4,"not, that I am not satisfied with the case against Derek Kettering?"" ""That is what I have been wondering. I thought, in Nice, that you had finished with the case."" ""You do not say all that you mean, Mademoiselle. But I admit everything. It was I--my researches--which placed Derek Kettering where he is now. But for me the Examining Magistrate would still be vainly trying to fasten the crime on the Comte de la Roche. _Eh bien_, Mademoiselle, what I have done I do not regret. I have only one duty--to discover the truth, and that way led straight to Mr. Kettering. But did it end there? The police say yes, but I, Hercule Poirot, am not satisfied."" He broke off suddenly. ""Tell me, Mademoiselle, have you heard from Mademoiselle Lenox lately?"" ""One very short, scrappy letter. She is, I think, annoyed with me for coming back"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,5,"to England."" Poirot nodded. ""I had an interview with her the night that Monsieur Kettering was arrested. It was an interesting interview in more ways than one."" Again he fell silent, and Katherine did not interrupt his train of thought. ""Mademoiselle,"" he said at last, ""I am now on delicate ground, yet I will say this to you. There is, I think, some one who loves Monsieur Kettering--correct me if I am wrong--and for her sake--well--for her sake I hope that I am right and the police are wrong. You know who that some one is?"" There was a pause, then Katherine said: ""Yes--I think I know."" Poirot leant across the table towards her. ""I am not satisfied, Mademoiselle; no, I am not satisfied. The facts, the main facts, led straight to Monsieur Kettering. But there is one thing that has been left out of account."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,6,"""And what is that?"" ""The disfigured face of the victim. I have asked myself, Mademoiselle, a hundred times, 'Was Derek Kettering the kind of man who would deal that smashing blow after having committed the murder?' What end would it serve? What purpose would it accomplish? Was it a likely action for one of Monsieur Kettering's temperament? And, Mademoiselle, the answer to these questions is profoundly unsatisfactory. Again and again I go back to that one point--'why?' And the only things I have to help me to a solution of the problem are these."" He whipped out his pocket-book and extracted something from it which he held between his finger and thumb. ""Do you remember, Mademoiselle? You saw me take these hairs from the rug in the railway carriage."" Katherine leant forward, scrutinizing the hairs keenly. Poirot nodded his head slowly several times. ""They suggest nothing"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,7,"to you, I see that, Mademoiselle. And yet--I think somehow that you see a good deal."" ""I have had ideas,"" said Katherine slowly, ""curious ideas. That is why I ask you what you were doing in Paris, Monsieur Poirot."" ""When I wrote to you--"" ""From the Ritz?"" A curious smile came over Poirot's face. ""Yes, as you say, from the Ritz. I am a luxurious person sometimes--when a millionaire pays."" ""The Russian Embassy,"" said Katherine, frowning. ""No, I don't see where that comes in."" ""It does not come in directly, Mademoiselle. I went there to get certain information. I saw a particular personage and I threatened him--yes, Mademoiselle, I, Hercule Poirot, threatened him."" ""With the police?"" ""No,"" said Poirot drily, ""with the Press--a much more deadly weapon."" He looked at Katherine and she smiled at him, just shaking her head. ""Are you not just turning back"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,8,"into an oyster again, Monsieur Poirot?"" ""No, no! I do not wish to make mysteries. See, I will tell you everything. I suspect this man of being the active party in the sale of the jewels of Monsieur Van Aldin. I tax him with it, and in the end I get the whole story out of him. I learn where the jewels were handed over, and I learn, too, of the man who paced up and down outside in the street--a man with a venerable head of white hair, but who walked with the light, springy step of a young man--and I give that man a name in my own mind--the name of 'Monsieur le Marquis.'"" ""And now you have come to London to see Mr. Van Aldin?"" ""Not entirely for that reason. I had other work to do. Since I have been in London I"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,9,"have seen two more people--a theatrical agent and a Harley Street doctor. From each of them I have got certain information. Put these things together, Mademoiselle, and see if you can make of them the same as I do."" ""I?"" ""Yes, you. I will tell you one thing, Mademoiselle. There has been a doubt all along in my mind as to whether the robbery and the murder were done by the same person. For a long time I was not sure--"" ""And now?"" ""And now I _know_."" There was a silence. Then Katherine lifted her head. Her eyes were shining. ""I am not clever like you, Monsieur Poirot. Half the things that you have been telling me don't seem to me to point anywhere at all. The ideas that came to me came from such an entirely different angle--"" ""Ah, but that is always so,"" said"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,32,32. Katherine and Poirot Compare Notes,10,"Poirot quietly. ""A mirror shows the truth, but every one stands in a different place for looking into the mirror."" ""My ideas may be absurd--they may be entirely different from yours, but--"" ""Yes?"" ""Tell me, does this help you at all?"" He took a newspaper cutting from her outstretched hand. He read it and, looking up, he nodded gravely. ""As I told you, Mademoiselle, one stands at a different angle for looking into the mirror, but it is the same mirror and the same things are reflected there."" Katherine got up. ""I must rush,"" she said. ""I have only just time to catch my train. Monsieur Poirot--"" ""Yes, Mademoiselle."" ""It--it mustn't be much longer, you understand. I--I can't go on much longer."" There was a break in her voice. He patted her hand reassuringly. ""Courage, Mademoiselle, you must not fail now; the end is very near."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,1,"""Monsieur Poirot wants to see you, sir."" ""Damn the fellow!"" said Van Aldin. Knighton remained sympathetically silent. Van Aldin got up from his chair and paced up and down. ""I suppose you have seen the cursed newspapers this morning?"" ""I have glanced at them, sir."" ""Still at it hammer and tongs?"" ""I am afraid so, sir."" The millionaire sat down again and pressed his hand to his forehead. ""If I had had an idea of this,"" he groaned. ""I wish to God I had never got that little"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,2,"Belgian to ferret out the truth. Find Ruth's murderer--that was all I thought about."" ""You wouldn't have liked your son-in-law to go scot free?"" Van Aldin sighed. ""I would have preferred to take the law into my own hands."" ""I don't think that would have been a very wise proceeding, sir."" ""All the same--are you sure the fellow wants to see me?"" ""Yes, Mr. Van Aldin. He is very urgent about it."" ""Then I suppose he will have to. He can come along this morning if he likes."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,3,"It was a very fresh and debonair Poirot who was ushered in. He did not seem to see any lack of cordiality in the millionaire's manner, and chatted pleasantly about various trifles. He was in London, he explained, to see his doctor. He mentioned the name of an eminent surgeon. ""No, no, _pas la guerre_--a memory of my days in the police force, a bullet of a rascally Apache."" He touched his left shoulder and winced realistically. ""I always consider you a lucky man, Monsieur Van Aldin; you"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,4,"are not like our popular idea of American millionaires, martyrs to the dyspepsia."" ""I am pretty tough,"" said Van Aldin. ""I lead a very simple life, you know; plain fare and not too much of it."" ""You have seen something of Miss Grey, have you not?"" inquired Poirot, innocently turning to the secretary. ""I--yes; once or twice,"" said Knighton. He blushed slightly and Van Aldin exclaimed in surprise: ""Funny you never mentioned to me that you had seen her, Knighton?"" ""I didn't think you would be interested, sir."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,5,"""I like that girl very much,"" said Van Aldin. ""It is a thousand pities that she should have buried herself once more in St. Mary Mead,"" said Poirot. ""It is very fine of her,"" said Knighton hotly. ""There are very few people who would bury themselves down there to look after a cantankerous old woman who has no earthly claim on her."" ""I am silent,"" said Poirot, his eyes twinkling a little; ""but all the same I say it is a pity. And now, Messieurs, let us come"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,6,"to business."" Both the other men looked at him in some surprise. ""You must not be shocked or alarmed at what I am about to say. Supposing, Monsieur Van Aldin, that, after all, Monsieur Derek Kettering did not murder his wife?"" ""What?"" Both men stared at him in blank surprise. ""Supposing, I say, that Monsieur Kettering did not murder his wife?"" ""Are you mad, Monsieur Poirot?"" It was Van Aldin who spoke. ""No,"" said Poirot, ""I am not mad. I am eccentric, perhaps--at least certain people say so;"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,7,"but as regards my profession, I am very much, as one says, 'all there.' I ask you, Monsieur Van Aldin, whether you would be glad or sorry if what I tell you should be the case?"" Van Aldin stared at him. ""Naturally I should be glad,"" he said at last. ""Is this an exercise in suppositions, Monsieur Poirot, or are there any facts behind it?"" Poirot looked at the ceiling. ""There is an off-chance,"" he said quietly, ""that it might be the Comte de la Roche after all."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,8,"At least I have succeeded in upsetting his alibi."" ""How did you manage that?"" Poirot shrugged his shoulders modestly. ""I have my own methods. The exercise of a little tact, a little cleverness--and the thing is done."" ""But the rubies,"" said Van Aldin, ""these rubies that the Count had in his possession were false."" ""And clearly he would not have committed the crime except for the rubies. But you are overlooking one point, Monsieur Van Aldin. Where the rubies were concerned, some one might have been before him."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,9,"""But this is an entirely new theory,"" cried Knighton. ""Do you really believe all this rigmarole, Monsieur Poirot?"" demanded the millionaire. ""The thing is not proved,"" said Poirot quietly. ""It is as yet only a theory, but I tell you this, Monsieur Van Aldin, the facts are worth investigating. You must come out with me to the south of France and go into the case on the spot."" ""You really think this is necessary--that I should go, I mean."" ""I thought it would be what you yourself would"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,33,33. A New Theory,10,"wish,"" said Poirot. There was a hint of reproach in his tone which was not lost upon the other. ""Yes, yes, of course,"" he said. ""When do you wish to start, Monsieur Poirot?"" ""You are very busy at present, sir,"" murmured Knighton. But the millionaire had now made up his mind, and he waved the other's objections aside. ""I guess this business comes first,"" he said. ""All right, Monsieur Poirot, to-morrow. What train?"" ""We will go, I think, by the Blue Train,"" said Poirot, and he smiled."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,1,"""The Millionaire's Train,"" as it is sometimes called, swung round a curve of line at what seemed a dangerous speed. Van Aldin, Knighton, and Poirot sat together in silence. Knighton and Van Aldin had two compartments connecting with each other, as Ruth Kettering and her maid had had on the fateful journey. Poirot's own compartment was further along the coach. The journey was a painful one for Van Aldin, recalling as it did the most agonizing memories. Poirot and Knighton conversed occasionally in low tones without disturbing him. When, however, the train had completed its slow journey round the _ceinture_ and reached the Gare de Lyon, Poirot became suddenly galvanized into activity. Van Aldin realized that part of his object in travelling by the train had been to attempt to reconstruct the crime. Poirot himself"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,2,"acted every part. He was in turn the maid, hurriedly shut into her own compartment, Mrs. Kettering, recognizing her husband with surprise and a trace of anxiety, and Derek Kettering discovering that his wife was travelling on the train. He tested various possibilities, such as the best way for a person to conceal himself in the second compartment. Then suddenly an idea seemed to strike him. He clutched at Van Aldin's arm. ""_Mon Dieu_, but that is something I have not thought of! We must break our journey in Paris. Quick, quick, let us alight at once."" Seizing suit-cases he hurried from the train. Van Aldin and Knighton, bewildered but obedient, followed him. Van Aldin having once formed his opinion of Poirot's ability was slow to part from it. At the barrier they were held"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,3,"up. Their tickets were in charge of the conductor of the train, a fact which all three of them had forgotten. Poirot's explanations were rapid, fluent, and impassioned, but they produced no effect upon the stolid-faced official. ""Let us get quit of this,"" said Van Aldin abruptly. ""I gather you are in a hurry, Monsieur Poirot. For God's sake pay the fares from Calais and let us get right on with whatever you have got in your mind."" But Poirot's flood of language had suddenly stopped dead, and he had the appearance of a man turned to stone. His arm, still outflung in an impassioned gesture, remained there as though stricken with paralysis. ""I have been an imbecile,"" he said simply. ""_Ma foi_, I lose my head nowadays. Let us return and continue our journey"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,4,"quietly. With reasonable luck the train will not have gone."" They were only just in time, the train moving off as Knighton, the last of the three, swung himself and his suitcase on board. The conductor remonstrated with them feelingly, and assisted them to carry their luggage back to their compartments. Van Aldin said nothing, but he was clearly disgusted at Poirot's extraordinary conduct. Alone with Knighton for a moment or two, he remarked: ""This is a wildgoose chase. The man has lost his grip on things. He has got brains up to a point, but any man who loses his head and scuttles round like a frightened rabbit is no earthly darned good."" Poirot came to them in a moment or two, full of abject apologies and clearly so crestfallen that harsh words would"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,5,"have been superfluous. Van Aldin received his apologies gravely, but managed to restrain himself from making acid comments. They had dinner on the train, and afterwards, somewhat to the surprise of the other two, Poirot suggested that they should all three set up in Van Aldin's compartment. The millionaire looked at him curiously. ""Is there anything that you are keeping back from us, Monsieur Poirot?"" ""I?"" Poirot opened his eyes in innocent surprise. ""But what an idea."" Van Aldin did not answer, but he was not satisfied. The conductor was told that he need not make up the beds. Any surprise he might have felt was obliterated by the largeness of the tip which Van Aldin handed to him. The three men sat in silence. Poirot fidgeted and seemed restless. Presently he turned to the"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,6,"secretary. ""Major Knighton, is the door of your compartment bolted? The door into the corridor, I mean."" ""Yes; I bolted it myself just now."" ""Are you sure?"" said Poirot. ""I will go and make sure, if you like,"" said Knighton smiling. ""No, no, do not derange yourself. I will see for myself."" He passed through the connecting door and returned in a second or two, nodding his head. ""Yes, yes, it is as you said. You must pardon an old man's fussy ways."" He closed the connecting door and resumed his place in the right-hand corner. The hours passed. The three men dozed fitfully, waking with uncomfortable starts. Probably never before had three people booked berths on the most luxurious train available, then declined to avail themselves of the accommodations they had paid for. Every"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,7,"now and then Poirot glanced at his watch, and then nodded his head and composed himself to slumber once more. On one occasion he rose from his seat and opened the connecting door, peered sharply into the adjoining compartment, and then returned to his seat, shaking his head. ""What is the matter?"" whispered Knighton. ""You are expecting something to happen, aren't you?"" ""I have the nerves,"" confessed Poirot. ""I am like the cat upon the hot tiles. Every little noise it makes me jump."" Knighton yawned. ""Of all the darned uncomfortable journeys,"" he murmured. ""I suppose you know what you are playing at, Monsieur Poirot."" He composed himself to sleep as best he could. Both he and Van Aldin had succumbed to slumber, when Poirot, glancing for the fourteenth time at his watch, leant across"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,8,"and tapped the millionaire on the shoulder. ""Eh? What is it?"" ""In five or ten minutes, Monsieur, we shall arrive at Lyons."" ""My God!"" Van Aldin's face looked white and haggard in the dim light. ""Then it must have been about this time that poor Ruth was killed."" He sat staring straight in front of him. His lips twitched a little, his mind reverting back to the terrible tragedy that had saddened his life. There was the usual long screaming sigh of the brake, and the train slackened speed and drew into Lyons. Van Aldin let down the window and leant out. ""If it wasn't Derek--if your new theory is correct, it is here that the man left the train?"" he asked over his shoulder. Rather to his surprise Poirot shook his head. ""No,"" he"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,9,"said thoughtfully, ""no _man_ left the train, but I think--yes, I think, a _woman_ may have done so."" Knighton gave a gasp. ""A woman?"" demanded Van Aldin sharply. ""Yes, a woman,"" said Poirot, nodding his head. ""You may not remember, Monsieur Van Aldin, but Miss Grey in her evidence mentioned that a youth in a cap and overcoat descended on to the platform ostensibly to stretch his legs. Me, I think that that youth was most probably a woman."" ""But who was she?"" Van Aldin's face expressed incredulity, but Poirot replied seriously and categorically. ""Her name--or the name under which she was known, for many years--is Kitty Kidd, but you, Monsieur Van Aldin, knew her by another name--_that of Ada Mason_."" Knighton sprang to his feet. ""What?"" he cried. Poirot swung round to him. ""Ah!--before"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,34,34. The Blue Train Again,10,"I forget it."" He whipped something from a pocket and held it out. ""Permit me to offer you a cigarette--out of your own cigarette case. It was careless of you to drop it when you boarded the train on the _ceinture_ at Paris."" Knighton stood staring at him as though stupefied. Then he made a movement, but Poirot flung up his hand in a warning gesture. ""No, don't move,"" he said in a silky voice; ""the door into the next compartment is open, and you are being covered from there this minute. I unbolted the door into the corridor when we left Paris, and our friends the police were told to take their places there. As I expect you know, the French police want you rather urgently, Major Knighton--or shall we say--Monsieur le Marquis?"""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,1,"""Explanations?"" Poirot smiled. He was sitting opposite the millionaire at a luncheon table in the latter's private suite at the Negresco. Facing him was a relieved but very puzzled man. Poirot leant back in his chair, lit one of his tiny cigarettes, and stared reflectively at the ceiling. ""Yes, I will give you explanations. It began with the one point that puzzled me. You know what that point was? _The disfigured face._ It is not an uncommon thing to find when investigating a crime and it rouses an immediate question, the question of identity. That naturally was the first thing that occurred to me. Was the dead woman really Mrs. Kettering? But that line led me nowhere, for Miss Grey's evidence was positive and very reliable, so I put that idea aside. The dead woman _was_ Ruth Kettering."" ""When did you first begin to suspect the maid?"" ""Not for some time, but one peculiar little point drew my attention to her. The cigarette case found in the railway carriage and which she told us was one which Mrs. Kettering had given to her husband. Now that was, on the face of it, most improbable, seeing the terms that they were on. It awakened a doubt in my mind as to the general veracity of Ada Mason's statements. There was the rather suspicious fact to be taken into consideration, that she had only been with her mistress for two months. Certainly it did not seem as if she could have had anything to do with the crime since she had been left behind in Paris and Mrs. Kettering had been seen alive by several people afterwards, but--"" Poirot leant forward. He raised an emphatic forefinger and wagged it with intense emphasis at Van Aldin. ""But I am a good detective. I suspect. There is nobody and nothing that I do not suspect. I believe nothing that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,2,"I am told. I say to myself: how do we know that Ada Mason was left behind in Paris? And at first the answer to that question seemed completely satisfactory. There was the evidence of your secretary, Major Knighton, a complete outsider whose testimony might be supposed to be entirely impartial, and there was the dead woman's own words to the conductor on the train. But I put the latter point aside for the moment, because a very curious idea--an idea perhaps fantastic and impossible--was growing up in my mind. If by any outside chance it happened to be true, that particular piece of testimony was worthless. ""I concentrated on the chief stumbling-block to my theory, Major Knighton's statement that he saw Ada Mason at the Ritz after the Blue Train had left Paris. That seemed conclusive enough, but yet, on examining the facts carefully, I noted two things. First, that by a curious coincidence he, too, had been exactly two months in your service. Secondly, his initial letter was the same--'K.' Supposing--just supposing--that it was _his_ cigarette case which had been found in the carriage. Then, if Ada Mason and he were working together, and she recognized it when we showed it to her, would she not act precisely as she had done? At first, taken aback, she quickly evolved a plausible theory that would agree with Mr. Kettering's guilt. _Bien entendu_, that was not the original idea. The Comte de la Roche was to be the scapegoat, though Ada Mason would not make her recognition of him too certain, in case he should be able to prove an alibi. Now, if you will cast your mind back to that time, you will remember a significant thing that happened. I suggested to Ada Mason that the man she had seen was not the Comte de la Roche, but Derek Kettering. She seemed uncertain at"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,3,"the time, but after I had got back to my hotel you rang me up and told me that she had come to you and said that, on thinking it over, she was now quite convinced that the man in question _was_ Mr. Kettering. I had been expecting something of the kind. There could be but one explanation of this sudden certainty on her part. After my leaving your hotel, she had had time to consult with somebody, and had received instructions which she acted upon. Who had given her these instructions? Major Knighton. And there was another very small point, which might mean nothing or might mean a great deal. In casual conversation Knighton had talked of a jewel robbery in Yorkshire in a house where he was staying. Perhaps a mere coincidence--perhaps another small link in the chain."" ""But there is one thing I do not understand, Monsieur Poirot. I guess I must be dense or I would have seen it before now. Who was the man in the train at Paris? Derek Kettering or the Comte de la Roche?"" ""That is the simplicity of the whole thing. _There was no man._ Ah--_mille tonnerres!_--do you not see the cleverness of it all? Whose word have we for it that there ever was a man there? Only Ada Mason's. And we believe in Ada Mason because of Knighton's evidence that she was left behind in Paris."" ""But Ruth herself told the conductor that she had left her maid behind there,"" demurred Van Aldin. ""Ah! I am coming to that. We have Mrs. Kettering's own evidence there, but, on the other hand, we have not really got her evidence, because, Monsieur Van Aldin, a dead woman cannot give evidence. It is not _her_ evidence, but the evidence of the conductor of the train--a very different affair altogether."" ""So you think the man was lying?"" ""No,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,4,"no, not at all. He spoke what he thought to be the truth. But the woman who told him that she had left her maid in Paris was not Mrs. Kettering."" Van Aldin stared at him. ""Monsieur Van Aldin, Ruth Kettering was dead before the train arrived at the Gare de Lyon. It was Ada Mason, dressed in her mistress's very distinctive clothing, who purchased a dinner basket and who made that very necessary statement to the conductor."" ""Impossible!"" ""No, no, Monsieur Van Aldin; not impossible. _Les femmes_, they look so much alike nowadays that one identifies them more by their clothing than by their faces. Ada Mason was the same height as your daughter. Dressed in that very sumptuous fur coat and the little red lacquer hat jammed down over her eyes, with just a bunch of auburn curls showing over each ear, it was no wonder that the conductor was deceived. He had not previously spoken to Mrs. Kettering, you remember. True, he had seen the maid just for a moment when she handed him the tickets, but his impression had been merely that of a gaunt, black-clad female. If he had been an unusually intelligent man, he might have gone so far as to say that mistress and maid were not unlike, but it is extremely unlikely that he would even think that. And remember, Ada Mason, or Kitty Kidd, was an actress, able to change her appearance and tone of voice at a moment's notice. No, no; there was no danger of his recognizing the maid in the mistress's clothing, but there _was_ the danger that when he came to discover the body he might realize it was not the woman he had talked to the night before. And now we see the reason for the disfigured face. The chief danger that Ada Mason ran was that Katherine Grey might visit"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,5,"her compartment after the train left Paris, and she provided against that difficulty by ordering a dinner basket and by locking herself in her compartment."" ""But who killed Ruth--and when?"" ""First, bear it in mind that the crime was planned and undertaken by the two of them--Knighton and Ada Mason, working together. Knighton was in Paris that day on your business. He boarded the train somewhere on its way round the _ceinture_. Mrs. Kettering would be surprised, but she would be quite unsuspicious. Perhaps he draws her attention to something out the window, and as she turns to look he slips the cord round her neck--and the whole thing is over in a second or two. The door of the compartment is locked, and he and Ada Mason set to work. They strip off the dead woman's outer clothes. Mason and Knighton roll the body up in a rug and put it on the seat in the adjoining compartment amongst the bags and suit-cases. Knighton drops off the train, taking the jewel-case containing the rubies with him. Since the crime is not supposed to have been committed until nearly twelve hours later he is perfectly safe, and his evidence and the supposed Mrs. Kettering's words to the conductor will provide a perfect alibi for his accomplice. ""At the Gare de Lyon Ada Mason gets a dinner basket, and shutting herself into the toilet compartment she quickly changes into her mistress's clothes, adjusts two false bunches of auburn curls, and generally makes up to resemble her as closely as possible. When the conductor comes to make up the bed, she tells him the prepared story about having left her maid behind in Paris; and whilst he is making up the berth, she stands looking out of the window, so that her back is towards the corridor and people passing along there. That was a wise precaution,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,6,"because, as we know, Miss Grey was one of those passing, and she, among others, was willing to swear that Mrs. Kettering was still alive at that hour."" ""Go on,"" said Van Aldin. ""Before getting to Lyons, Ada Mason arranged her mistress's body in the bunk, folded up the dead woman's clothes neatly on the end of it, and herself changed into a man's clothes and prepared to leave the train. When Derek Kettering entered his wife's compartment, and, as he thought, saw her asleep in her berth, the scene had been set, and Ada Mason was hidden in the next compartment waiting for the moment to leave the train unobserved. As soon as the conductor had swung himself down on to the platform at Lyons, she follows, slouching along as though just taking a breath of air. At a moment when she is unobserved, she hurriedly crosses to the other platform, and takes the first train back to Paris and the Ritz Hotel. Her name has been registered there as taking a room the night before by one of Knighton's female accomplices. She has nothing to do but wait there placidly for your arrival. The jewels are not, and never have been, in her possession. No suspicion attaches to him, and, as your secretary, he brings them to Nice without the least fear of discovery. Their delivery there to Monsieur Papopolous is already arranged for and they are entrusted to Mason at the last moment to hand over to the Greek. Altogether a very neatly planned coup, as one would expect from a master of the game such as the Marquis."" ""And you honestly mean that Richard Knighton is a well-known criminal, who has been at this business for years?"" Poirot nodded. ""One of the chief assets of the gentleman called the Marquis was his plausible, ingratiating manner. You fell a victim to"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,7,"his charm, Monsieur Van Aldin, when you engaged him as a secretary on such a slight acquaintanceship."" ""I could have sworn that he never angled for the post,"" cried the millionaire. ""It was very astutely done--so astutely done that it deceived a man whose knowledge of other men is as great as yours is."" ""I looked up his antecedents too. The fellow's record was excellent."" ""Yes, yes; that was part of the game. As Richard Knighton his life was quite free from reproach. He was well born, well connected, did honourable service in the War, and seemed altogether above suspicion; but when I came to glean information about the mysterious Marquis, I found many points of similarity. Knighton spoke French like a Frenchman, he had been in America, France, and England at much the same time as the Marquis was operating. The Marquis was last heard of as engineering various jewel robberies in Switzerland, and it was in Switzerland that you had come across Major Knighton; and it was at precisely that time that the first rumours were going round of your being in treaty for the famous rubies."" ""But why murder?"" murmured Van Aldin brokenly. ""Surely a clever thief could have stolen the jewels without running his head into a noose."" Poirot shook his head. ""This is not the first murder that lies to the Marquis's charge. He is a killer by instinct; he believes, too, in leaving no evidence behind him. Dead men and women tell no tales. ""The Marquis had an intense passion for famous and historical jewels. He laid his plans far beforehand by installing himself as your secretary and getting his accomplice to obtain the situation of maid with your daughter, for whom he guessed the jewels were destined. And, though this was his matured and carefully thought-out plan, he did not scruple to attempt a shortcut by hiring"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,8,"a couple of Apaches to waylay you in Paris on the night you bought the jewels. That plan failed, which hardly surprised him, I think. This plan was, so he thought, completely safe. No possible suspicion could attach to Richard Knighton. But like all great men--and the Marquis was a great man--he had his weaknesses. He fell genuinely in love with Miss Grey, and suspecting her liking for Derek Kettering, he could not resist the temptation to saddle him with the crime when the opportunity presented itself. And now, Monsieur Van Aldin, I am going to tell you something very curious. Miss Grey is not a fanciful woman by any means, yet she firmly believes that she felt your daughter's presence beside her one day in the Casino Gardens at Monte Carlo, just after she had been having a long talk with Knighton. She was convinced, she says, that the dead woman was urgently trying to tell her something, and it suddenly came to her that what the dead woman was trying to say was that Knighton was her murderer! The idea seemed so fantastic at the time that Miss Grey spoke of it to no one. But she was so convinced of its truth that she acted on it--wild as it seemed. She did not discourage Knighton's advances, and she pretended to him that she was convinced of Derek Kettering's guilt."" ""Extraordinary,"" said Van Aldin. ""Yes, it is very strange. One cannot explain these things. Oh, by the way, there is one little point that baffled me considerably. Your secretary has a decided limp--the result of a wound that he received in the War. Now the Marquis most decidedly did not limp. That was a stumbling-block. But Miss Lenox Tamplin happened to mention one day that Knighton's limp had been a surprise to the surgeons who had been in charge of the case"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,9,"in her mother's hospital. That suggested camouflage. When I was in London I went to the surgeon in question, and I got several technical details from him which confirmed me in that belief. I mentioned the name of that surgeon in Knighton's hearing the day before yesterday. The natural thing would have been for Knighton to mention that he had been attended by him during the War, but he said nothing--and that little point, if nothing else, gave me the last final assurance that my theory of the crime was correct. Miss Grey, too, provided me with a cutting, showing that there had been a robbery at Lady Tamplin's hospital during the time that Knighton had been there. She realized that I was on the same track as herself when I wrote to her from the Ritz in Paris. ""I had some trouble in my inquiries there, but I got what I wanted--evidence that Ada Mason arrived on the morning after the crime and not on the evening of the day before."" There was a long silence, then the millionaire stretched out a hand to Poirot across the table. ""I guess you know what this means to me, Monsieur Poirot,"" he said huskily. ""I am sending you round a cheque in the morning, but no cheque in the world will express what I feel about what you have done for me. You are the goods, Monsieur Poirot. Every time, you are the goods."" Poirot rose to his feet; his chest swelled. ""I am only Hercule Poirot,"" he said modestly, ""yet, as you say, in my own way I am a big man, even as you also are a big man. I am glad and happy to have been of service to you. Now I go to repair the damages caused by travel. Alas! my excellent Georges is not with me."" In the lounge of"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,35,35. Explanations,10,"the hotel he encountered a friend--the venerable Monsieur Papopolous, his daughter Zia beside him. ""I thought you had left Nice, Monsieur Poirot,"" murmured the Greek as he took the detective's affectionately proffered hand. ""Business compelled me to return, my dear Monsieur Papopolous."" ""Business?"" ""Yes, business. And talking of business, I hope your health is better, my dear friend?"" ""Much better. In fact, we are returning to Paris to-morrow."" ""I am enchanted to hear such good news. You have not completely ruined the Greek ex-Minister, I hope."" ""I?"" ""I understand you sold him a very wonderful ruby which--strictly _entre nous_--is being worn by Mademoiselle Mirelle, the dancer?"" ""Yes,"" murmured Monsieur Papopolous; ""yes, that is so."" ""A ruby not unlike the famous 'Heart of Fire'."" ""It has points of resemblance, certainly,"" said the Greek casually. ""You have a wonderful hand with jewels, Monsieur Papopolous. I congratulate you. Mademoiselle Zia, I am desolate that you are returning to Paris so speedily. I had hoped to see some more of you now that my business is accomplished."" ""Would one be indiscreet if one asked what that business was?"" asked Monsieur Papopolous. ""Not at all, not at all. I have just succeeded in laying the Marquis by the heels."" A far-away look came over Monsieur Papopolous' noble countenance. ""The Marquis?"" he murmured; ""now why does that seem familiar to me? No--I cannot recall it."" ""You would not, I am sure,"" said Poirot. ""I refer to a very notable criminal and jewel robber. He has just been arrested for the murder of the English lady, Madame Kettering."" ""Indeed? How interesting these things are!"" A polite exchange of farewells followed, and when Poirot was out of earshot, Monsieur Papopolous turned to his daughter. ""Zia,"" he said, with feeling, ""that man is the devil!"" ""I like him."" ""I like him myself,"" admitted Monsieur Papopolous. ""But he is the devil, all the same."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,1,"The mimosa was nearly over. The scent of it in the air was faintly unpleasant. There were pink geraniums twining along the balustrade of Lady Tamplin's villa, and masses of carnations below sent up a sweet, heavy perfume. The Mediterranean was at its bluest. Poirot sat on the terrace with Lenox Tamplin. He had"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,2,"just finished telling her the same story he had told to Van Aldin two days before. Lenox had listened to him with absorbed attention, her brows knitted and her eyes sombre. When he had finished she said simply: ""And Derek?"" ""He was released yesterday."" ""And he has gone--where?"" ""He left Nice last night."" ""For"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,3,"St. Mary Mead?"" ""Yes, for St. Mary Mead."" There was a pause. ""I was wrong about Katherine,"" said Lenox. ""I thought she did not care."" ""She is very reserved. She trusts no one."" ""She might have trusted me,"" said Lenox, with a shade of bitterness. ""Yes,"" said Poirot gravely, ""she might have trusted you."
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,4,"But Mademoiselle Katherine has spent a great deal of her life listening, and those who have listened do not find it easy to talk; they keep their sorrows and joys to themselves and tell no one."" ""I was a fool,"" said Lenox; ""I thought she really cared for Knighton. I ought to have known"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,5,"better. I suppose I thought so because--well, I hoped so."" Poirot took her hand and gave it a little friendly squeeze. ""Courage, Mademoiselle,"" he said gently. Lenox looked very straight out across the sea, and her face, in its ugly rigidity, had for the moment a tragic beauty. ""Oh, well,"" she said at last,"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,6,"""it would not have done. I am too young for Derek; he is like a kid that has never grown up. He wants the Madonna touch."" There was a long silence, then Lenox turned to him quickly and impulsively. ""But I _did_ help, Monsieur Poirot--at any rate I did help."" ""Yes, Mademoiselle. It was"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,7,"you who gave me the first inkling of the truth when you said that the person who committed the crime need not have been on the train at all. Before that, I could not see how the thing had been done."" Lenox drew a deep breath. ""I am glad,"" she said; ""at any rate--that"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,8,"is something."" From far behind them there came a long-drawn-out scream of an engine's whistle. ""That is that damned Blue Train,"" said Lenox. ""Trains are relentless things, aren't they, Monsieur Poirot? People are murdered and die, but they go on just the same. I am talking nonsense, but you know what I mean."""
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,9,"""Yes, yes, I know. Life is like a train, Mademoiselle. It goes on. And it is a good thing that that is so."" ""Why?"" ""Because the train gets to its journey's end at last, and there is a proverb about that in your language, Mademoiselle."" ""'Journeys end in lovers meeting.'"" Lenox laughed. ""That"
8,The Plymouth Express Affair,36,36. By the Sea,10,"is not going to be true for me."" ""Yes--yes, it is true. You are young, younger than you yourself know. Trust the train, Mademoiselle, for it is _le bon Dieu_ who drives it."" The whistle of the engine came again. ""Trust the train, Mademoiselle,"" murmured Poirot again. ""And trust Hercule Poirot. He knows."""
